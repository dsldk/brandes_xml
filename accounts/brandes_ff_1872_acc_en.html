        <p>The text is set with antiqua, display settings with spacing. Aside from an introductory
            section (pp. 3-6), <em>Explanation and Defense</em> is divided into five sections,
            designated with Roman numerals. Citations and footnotes are set with a smaller type
            size. Pages 25-26 and 77 are modelled on Brandes’ childhood friend, the art historian
            Julius Lange (1838-1896); compare Georg Brandes: <em>Julius Lange: Letters from his
                Youth</em>, 1898, pp. 225-26. <em>Explanation and Defense</em> was Brandes’ response
            to the reviewers and critics who had in the daily press and journals addressed
                <em>Emigrant Literature</em>, which was published on February 8th, 1872.</p>

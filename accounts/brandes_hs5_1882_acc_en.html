            <h1 id="publicationhistory">Publication History of <em>Main Currents</em></h1>
            <p><em>Main Currents in Nineteenth Century Literature</em> was published between 1872
                and 1890 in six volumes, after which it was reissued in a series of new editions,
                the last with his own revisions appearing in 1923-24. By then the sum total of each
                individual volume of the work had reached 15,000 copies.</p>
            <p>The first editions were published through Gyldendalske Boghandel (F. Hegel) in
                Copenhagen, which after a 1903 merger was called Gyldendalske Boghandel Nordisk
                Forlag, now with offices in Copenhagen and Christiana (Oslo), later also in London
                and Berlin. After Brandes’ death in 1927 sales stagnated, until in 1967 Jespersen
                &amp; Pio arranged a new edition of the whole work with modernized orthography.
                Emigrant Literature, the first volume, was additionally reissued in 1971 and
                1999.</p>
            <p>The individual volumes were quickly translated into German and sold well. In 1880
                Brandes switched from Duncker (later Barsdorf) to Veit &amp; Co. This set off a
                complex legal conflict, which resulted in editions from both publishers being
                published alongside one another.</p>
            <p>In addition to this, the entire work appeared in Russian, English, Japanese, Chinese,
                Yiddish, and Spanish translations; the Polish edition contained only the first five
                volumes. Translations of individual volumes also appeared Czech, Finnish and
                French.</p>
            <p>Here follows an introductory discussion of the lectures on which the volumes were
                based, the handwritten manuscripts and the details of publication. Thereafter
                follows an account of the various Danish editions of <em>Main Currents</em>,
                followed by the German editions and finally the six individual volumes in Danish and
                translated editions. The translations into the various languages are arranged
                chronologically, and therefore vary from volume to volume.</p>

            <div>
                <h2 id="lectures">a. Lectures</h2>
                <p>The background of the six volumes of <em>Main Currents</em> in Nineteenth Century
                    Literature was the series of lectures Brandes delivered between 1871 and 1886 at
                    Copenhagen University, at which however he did not manage to secure a permanent
                    position. Brandes had earned a doctorate in 1870 with a dissertation on Hippolye
                    Taine and French aesthetics, and could therefore, as <em>privatdocent</em>,
                    deliver the lectures in exchange for entrance fees. During the years 1877-1883,
                    when he was residing in Berlin, Brandes returned to Copenhagen to deliver
                    shorter lecture series; after his return in 1883 he received financial support
                    from private sources. This support, roughly equivalent to the salary of a
                    professor, was conditional on his delivering public lectures gratis at the
                    university. It was arranged that the first iterations of his lectures were
                    delivered in exchange for admission fees, while free and public versions were
                    then given several days later. </p>
                <p>Some information on the precise dates of the lectures that formed the basis of
                    the published volumes of <em>Main Currents</em> is summarized on the title pages
                    of the individual volumes. This is further supplement by notices and
                    advertisements in newspapers, but only rarely by the university catalog. In
                    certain instances it has not been possible to determine a precis date for the
                    conclusion of a series. It is similarly the case that lectures on themes found
                    in the six volumes that Brandes delivered at locations other than Copenhagen
                    University can only be dated and titled with a degree of uncertainty.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2 id="manuscripts">b. Manuscripts</h2>
                <p> Brandes’ manuscripts are preserved to a large extent, the majority in the
                    Brandes Archive at the Royal Library, which was established in 1912 and later
                    bolstered considerably with gifs from Brandes himself as well as, after 1927,
                    from his family.</p>
                <p>At the end of the 1930s, and again at the beginning of the 1970s, the lecturer
                    Morten Borup reviewed the manuscript collection at the Brandes Archive. The
                    research librarian Kirsten Weber later reviewed them again, producing a 46 page
                    index in 1986, which is accessible at www.kb.dk/permalink/2006/manus/691/dan/.
                    The information in the index is not always precise and demands critical
                    attention; individual manuscripts, among them those of the six volumes of
                        <em>Main Currents</em>, are chronologically misplaced.</p>
                <p>Aside from the Brandes-Archive, a significant number of manuscripts are stored in
                    other collections at the Royal Library: The Collin Collection (Coll.), the New
                    Royal Collection (NKS) and Later Acquisitions (Acc.). There are two published
                    summaries of the manuscripts: Lauritz Nielsen, <em>Katalog over danske og norske
                        Digteres Originalmanuskripter i Det kongelige Bibliotek</em>, 1943, og
                    Birgitte Possing og Bruno Svindborg (eds.), <em>Det Kongelige Biblioteks
                        Håndskriftafdeling. Erhvervelser 1924-1987</em>, 1-2, 1995. In 1988 the
                    Royal Library transitioned to electronic indexing of the material held by the
                    hand written manuscript department.</p>
                <p>Wherever there are manuscripts, the placement (call number), size and description
                    are provided. The abbreviation kps. stands for capsule (and sheet).</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 id="bookdetails">c. Book Details</h2>
                <p>Information on publications dates and print runs (stock for sale + review and
                    gratis copies) is taken from the Gyldendal archive at the Royal Library, in
                    individual from the “Danish Book Registry.” Wherever it is noted, the six
                    volumes of <em>Main Currents</em> up to 1899 were sold unbound with letterpress
                    printed wrapping. Bound copies were thus all bound privately and the placement
                    of the half title page and the table of contents caries from example to
                    example.</p>
                <p>Price information is taken from the weekly publication of the Danish Book
                    Registry in the <em>Danish Bookseller News</em>. Denmark changed its monetary
                    standard from the rigsdaler (96 skillings) to the krone (100 øre) in 1875.</p>
                <p>The division of the six volumes varies. In general there are (unnumbered)
                    chapters. Chapter titles are listed in the tables of contents; in most, but not
                    all cases, chapter titles also appear at the top of each page. The chapters can
                    be further divided into shorter sections, the titles of which can be indicated
                    at the top of the page. All sections are indicated by a Roman number in a
                    continuous series for the whole volume; this is not however the case with
                        <em>Emigrant Literature</em>.</p>
                <p> Page measurements are listed as broad and long and excluding pagination and page
                    titles. </p>

            <div>
                <h2 id="CollectedWritings">d. <em>Collected Writings</em></h2>
                <p>Brandes’ <em>Collected Writings</em>, published between 1899 and 1902 in 12
                    volumes, were billed as the “Standard and Popular Edition” and sold by
                    subscription, 89 installments in total. The installments were normally 80 pages,
                    corresponding to five sheets and priced at 50 øre. Page measurement was 102 x
                    149 mm.</p>
                <p>The print run for the first installment that kicked of the edition in March 1899
                    was 14,000, but eventually this stabilized at around 6000 copies. There were
                    various publisher’s bindings. Volume 12 has an index of named persons, which
                    covers the whole of <em>Main Currents</em>, contained in volumes four, five and
                    six. Between 1903 and 1910 six supplemental volumes were added to the original
                    12.</p>
                <p>In the course of preparing his <em>Collected Writings</em>, Brandes conducted an
                    expansive revision of the material, for example replacing foreign words and
                    expressions with Danish synonyms. At the same time the orthography was
                    modernized, including the elimination of the plural verb forms. Brandes
                    furthermore translated the majority of the foreign language citations, first and
                    foremost those of poetry, into Danish. And finally Brandes revised the content
                    of his works, typically by updating the material and making additions, which
                    were often adapted from his own reviews and later articles.</p>
                <p>The form Brandes gave to <em>Main Currents</em> in his <em>Collected
                        Writings</em> was the basis for the English translation of 1901-1905, for
                    the Japanese edition of 1915 as well as – via the English and Japanese
                    translations, the (partial) Chinese edition of 1936.</p>
                <p>Between March 1906 and April 1907, the fourth, fifth and sixth volumes of the
                        <em>Collected Works</em> (containing <em>Main Currents</em>) were published
                    without changes in a three volume popular edition, sold in 30 installments. The
                    print run was 3000. Because of an error, this edition was designated as the
                    “fifth edition.” This was was because <em>Emigrant Literature</em> was in its
                    fifth edition, while the other five volumes were only in their fourth (at the
                    time, no distinction was observed between “printing” and “edition”). The
                        <em>Collected Works</em> as well as the popular edition of <em>Main
                        Currents</em> were marketed in slightly varied publisher’s bindings. The
                    front page was emblazoned with a round vignette of “Saint George and the
                    Dragon,” the back with Saint George’s sword wound through a rose vine with
                    thorns, the hilt forming the letters GB. A corresponding publisher’s binding was
                    then used for other Brandes works.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 id="1923-24">e. The 1923-1924 Edition</h2>
                <p>In 1923 and 1924 Brandes once again revised <em>Main Currents in Nineteenth
                        Century Literature</em>, adding among other things a new foreword. In
                    relation to the revisions from the third to the fourth edition there a few
                    changes. The poetry citations in volumes four, five and six are in most cases
                    given in both the original language (English, French, German) as well as in
                    Brandes’ Danish translations, thus combining the foreign language form of the
                    early editions with the translations in the <em>Collected Works</em>.</p>
                <p>The edition was published in six volumes with a print run of 3000, the first two
                    volumes in 1923, the last four in 1924. Page measurement was 102 x 150 mm. Later
                    the six volumes were bound in three publisher’s volumes. (Printed on the covers
                    of the sheet copies was ’Københavns Universitet,’ on the title pages
                    ’Kjøbenhavns Universitet’; “literatur” is spelled with a single “t.”</p>
                <p>The edition did not sell well. Three years later Gyldendal thus repackaged it in
                    the three volume format. In connection with Brandes’ 85th birthday in February
                    1927, the publisher reissued the edition in sheet format and with new covers;
                    the first sheet was printed in 5000 copies, but sales did not take off, and
                    after the issuing of still more sheets for subscription the project was
                    abandoned in April 1928.</p>
                <p>The 1923-1924 edition later became the basis for the edition of <em>Main
                        Currents</em> issued by Jespersen and Pio in 1966-1967, but newly set and
                    with modern orthography aside from the title page’s conspicuous combination of
                    old and new. Each of the six volumes is supplied with illustrations, notes and a
                    quite detailed index produced by the publisher’s chief, Ivar Jespersen
                    (1904-1995).</p>
                <p>Brandes’ translations of poetry from the <em>Collected Writings</em> are to a
                    larger extent than in the edition of 1923-1924 reinserted and placed behind the
                    foreign language citations. New, detailed page titles are further added. In the
                    first volume of the edition (pp. 227-40), a reconstruction of Brandes’
                    introductory lecture of November 1871 by Henning Fenger (1921-1985), first
                    written in 1956, is included.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 id="germaneditions">f. German Editions</h2>
                <p>The first four volumes of <em>Main Currents</em> were quickly translated to
                    German byAdolf Strodtmann (1829-1879), published as <em>Die Hauptströmungen der
                        Literatur des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts</em> by Duncker of Berlin in 1872,
                    1873, 1874 and 1876.The publisher, led by Franz Duncker (1822-1888), was after a
                    bankruptcy taken over by Hermann Barsdorff (18?-19?) and moved to Leipzig,
                    although after 1900 it was relocated to Berlin (Charlottenburg).</p>
                <p>In 1880 Brandes entered into an agreement with the publisher Veit &amp; Co. of
                    Leipzig (led by Hermann Credner, 1842-1924) for a new edition, now titled
                        <em>Die Literatur des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts in ihren Hauptströmungen
                        dargestellt</em>. The publisher bought the publication rights to the already
                    published four translated volumes, but not the rights to Strodtmann’s
                    translations. Since Denmark only signed the Berne Convention in 1903, Barsdorf
                    could before then issue new printings and editions of Strodtmann’s translations
                    without an agreement and without paying royalties to Brandes.</p>
                <p>In 1886 Barsdorf issued a second printing, in 1892 a third with claiming to be
                    the “Einzig autorisierte deutsche Ausgabe.” An edition of the first five volumes
                    issued in 1894-1896 was marketed as “Vierte, vermehrte und mit einem
                    Generalregister versehene Auflage.” These editions were as a rule provided with
                    a double title page, the first with the title of the whole work and an
                    indication of the print run, which only applied to the first four volumes and
                    thus did not cover the last two. Furthermore, the fourth edition’s first and
                    third volumes were dedicated to Paul Heyse, the second to Hippolyte Taine, and
                    the fourth to Giuseppe Saredo.</p>
                <p>The fifth edition was billed as “Jubilee edition” celebrating the 25th
                    anniversary of the beginning of the work, and on page one contained the
                    publisher Barsdorff’s foreword, dated November 1896:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Vorwort zur fünften, gänzlich umgearbeiteten und vermehrten Auflage. – Dieser
                        fünften Auflage der Hauptströmungen sind die <b>neuesten dänischen
                            Originalausgaben</b> und zwar […] zu Grunde gelegt worden, so dass des
                        Werk jetzt in seiner neuen Gestalt den ”anfänglichen Hoffnungen und
                        Absichten” seines Autors entspricht. Es erzählt ein Stück europäischer
                        Seelengeschichte, indem es den Entwicklungsgang der Litteratur der ersten
                        Hälfte des 19. Jahrhunderts darstellt. Ich habe diese fünfte Auflage
                            <b>Jubiläums-Ausgabe</b> genannt, weil bei Beginn ihrer Drucklegung – im
                        November 1896 – gerade fünfundzwanzig Jahre verflossen waren, seit die
                        Hauptströmungen als Vorlesungen an der Kopenhagener Universität zum ersten
                        Male gehalten wurden. Welches Aufsehen sie damals erregten, welche
                        Begeisterung sie hervorriefen, ist von dem trefflichen Adolf Strodtmann,
                        ihrem ersten Uebersetzer, in seiner klassischen Einleitung zum ersten Bande
                        geschildert worden. Der Geist absoluter Freiheit, der in allen sechs Bänden
                        herrscht, wird, dessen bin ich gewiss, den ”Hauptströmungen” weitere
                        fünfundzwanzig Jahre in der Gunst der geistig Freigewordenen aller Länder
                        sichern. </p>
                    <p>Leipzig, November 1896</p>
                    <p>Der Herausgeber</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Thereafter (pp. III-XVIII) followed Strodtmann’s foreword to the first four
                    volumes. The general index from the fourth printing was expanded to include the
                    fifth volume, while the sixth had its own index.</p>
                <p> In 1900 Barsdorf published Brandes’ <em>Ausgewählte Schriften</em> in nine
                    volumes, of which three through eight contained <em>Hauptströmungen</em>. There
                    was still another edition in 1906, designated the 10th and collecting all six
                    volumes into two. The publisher further arranged for editions of parts of the
                    individual volumes; these are not covered in this review.</p>
                <p>It is evident that Barsdorf’s editions did not incorporate the revisions Brandes
                    made to the Danish editions, so that the content of the various printings is not
                    consistent. Since no royalties were paid to Brandes, the books could be sold at
                    lower price than Veit &amp; Co.’s editions.</p>
                <p>Brandes’ agreement with Veit &amp; Co. stipulated that new, revised editions of
                    the first four volumes should be prepared in 1882. Only the fifth volume was
                    newly issued in 1883. When Veit and Co. issued the second volume in the new
                    series in 1887, Barsdorff, who had by then taken over Duncker, filed suit,
                    because the first and second volumes relied excessively on Strodtmann’s
                    translations. Brandes defended himself and the publisher with an account
                    addressed to Hermann Credner and dated June 22nd, 1887. This was then published
                    in Danish in <em>Politiken</em> on July 4th under the title “A Letter from Dr.
                    G. Brandes.” After a series of hearings in numerous courts, the supreme court
                    issued a ruling in favor of Barsdorf in 1889, and all remaining copies were
                    confiscated.</p>
                <p>Who it was who translated the new parts of the second volume remains unknown. The
                    volumes had to be reconstituted according to a reworking by Brandes
                    corresponding to the Danish editions of the 1890s. Hence parts of volume two and
                    the whole of three and four were (anonymously) translated between 1898 and 1901
                    by Mathilde Prager (1844-1921), who for many years, generally under the
                    pseudonym Erich Holm, translated and introduced Nordic authors such as Jonas
                    Lie, August Strindberg, Henrik Ibsen, Georg Brandes and Jeppe Aakjær. For more

                    pp. 119-134).</p>
                <p>Barsdorf saw to the new translations of the final two volumes, the fifth in 1886
                    in a translation by W. Rudow, the sixth only in 1896 and translated by A. v. d.
                    Linden, because a new rule protected the translation published by Veit &amp; Co.
                    in 1891.</p>
                <p>After Denmark signed the Berne Convention, peace reigned in the conflict. Reiss
                    Verlag of Berlin issued in 1923-1924 in three volumes <em>Hauptströmungen der
                        Literatur des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts. Vom Verfasser neu bearbeitete
                        endgültige Ausgabe. (Unter Zugrundelegung der Übertragung von Adolf

                    The first volume was issued in a third printing the same year, while the two
                    others appeared in a second printing.</p>
                <p>The manuscripts for the German editions are indexed, but not the translations of
                    Brandes’ published preliminary studies which encompassed a number of languages,
                    especially German and Russian.</p>

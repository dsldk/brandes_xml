            <h2>a. <em> Memoirs</em></h2>
            <p>Brandes’ three volume <em>Memoirs</em> was published between 1905 and 1908, each
                volume in 2200 copies. However, they sold poorly; in 1912 between 1200 and 1500
                copies of each were in remainders. A planned fourth volume was thus never produced,
                but the beginning of a manuscript is preserved in the Brandes Archive, kps.
                233-234/330-331 (Preliminary work for the fourth volume of the <em>Memoirs</em>:
                three sheets with preliminary work for the years 1893-1896, 3 + 23 + 58 pages,
                incomplete) as well as newly begun fair copy from circa 1909 (10 pages).</p>

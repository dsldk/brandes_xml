<head type="add">Introduction</head>
                <head>INTRODUCTION</head>

                <p>A CERTAIN aggregation of personages, actions, emotions and moods, ideas and
                    works, which make their appearance in France, find expression in the French
                    language, and influence French society at the beginning of the nineteenth
                    century, form in my eyes a naturally coherent group, from the fact that they all
                    centre round one idea, namely, the re-establishment of a fallen power. This
                    fallen power is the principle of authority.</p>

                <p>By the principle of authority I understand the principle which assumes the life
                    of the individual and of the nation to be based upon reverence for inherited
                    tradition.</p>

                <p>That power which is its essential quality, authority owes simply to its own
                    existence, not to reason; it is a result of the involuntary or voluntary
                    subjection of men's minds to existing conditions. Authority had originally only
                    two instruments at its disposal, compulsion and fear, instruments which it will
                    always retain and use; but at an early age it began to call forth such feelings
                    as reverence and gratitude. Men were not ashamed of, did not suffer from, their
                    dependence on authority, when they felt that they owed an obligation to it. The
                    authority of the family, the authority of society, the authority of the state
                    (long synonymous with the will of the despotic ruler) gradually asserted
                    themselves, and supported themselves, one and all, upon a still higher
                    authority, the authority of religion. In it the principle of authority reaches
                    the absolute stage. The will of the Almighty becomes the supreme law, to which
                    all must bow and which must be blindly obeyed.</p>

                <p><pb n="2"/> The principle of authority has had a powerful educative influence on the human
                    race; but its real mission is to make itself superfluous. At a comparatively low
                    stage man submits to law because it emanates from authority; at a higher,
                    because he recognises its reasonableness. Where authority is absolute it must,
                    and as a matter of fact does, demand recognition as something mysterious and
                    miraculous, and treat all criticism as rebellion and heresy.</p>

                <p>It is its ratification by religion which makes authority absolute. Owing,
                    however, to the manner in which Christianity had developed in Europe, the
                    principle of authority had not as yet manifested itself in that continent in
                    perfect purity. Christianity had (officially at least) proclaimed itself to be
                    the religion of love, the religion of Christ. History shows that what the church
                    in reality laid most weight on was belief in the dogmas of Christianity and in
                    the duty of submission to supernatural authority–not love, but obedience was
                    necessarily of supreme importance to it as well as to the state. So far,
                    however, even the strictest of theologians, priests, and religious writers had
                    employed the language of religious enthusiasm, had proclaimed the message of
                    love along with the doctrines of the faith, and striven not merely to further
                    the cause of authority, but also to win souls. It was not until a majority of
                    the educated minds of many countries freed themselves from the yoke of authority
                    in the domain of the supernatural, and consequently became critically disposed
                    towards it in the political and social domains also, that the principle of
                    authority in its purity and its barrenness began to be vindicated unemotionally,
                    with arguments appealing most frequently to reason alone, but occasionally also
                    to the imagination.</p>

                <p>It is possible to champion the principle of authority in church and state, in
                    society and in the family, nay, even in the domain of human knowledge, as the
                    principle of knowledge and of wisdom. During the period of which I purpose
                    describing the spiritual life it was so championed in all those domains, but at
                    the time now referred to it was overthrown in them all.</p>

                <p>In order to understand how it came to be resuscitated, <pb n="3"/> proclaimed, developed,
                    vindicated, established, and finally again overthrown, it is necessary that we
                    should see how, and by virtue of what fundamental principles, it was annulled at
                    the time of the Revolution.</p>

                <p>It was not attacked at once in all the different domains; but it became evident
                    that its existence in them all depended upon its existence in what was
                    considered the highest, that of religion. For it was the church which, as
                      authority, imparted authority in all the other spheres of life–to the »king by
                      the grace of God,« to marriage as a sacrament, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

                <p>Therefore the principle of authority in general stood or fell with the authority
                    of the church. When that was undermined, it drew all other authorities with it
                    in its fall.</p>

                <p>Not that the man who, in the eighteenth century, laboured more energetically and
                    successfully than any other for the emancipation of the intellect from
                    ecclesiasticism and dogma had foreseen such a result of his labour. Far from it!
                    Voltaire desired no outward revolution. In his little tale, <emph>Le monde comme il
                    va</emph>, the wise Babouc, who is at first utterly revolted by the depravity of the
                    great city of Persepolis, gradually comes to see that the bad state of matters
                    has its good sides; and, when the fate of the city hangs upon his report to the
                    angel Ithuriel, he pronounces himself to be entirely opposed to its destruction.
                    Even the angel does not in the end propose making any change in the customs of
                    Persepolis, because, »though things are not good, they are certainly bearable.«
                    This train of thought can hardly be called revolutionary; and Voltaire is, at
                    least at times, of the same opinion as Babouc. It was always to the sovereigns,
                    not to the peoples, that he appealed to transform his ideas into actions, and he
                    often declared that the cause of kings and of philosophers was one and the same.
                    Hence when Holbach and his collaborators asserted that »hardly once in a
                    thousand years was there to be found amongst these rulers by the grace of God,
                    these representatives of the Deity, a man possessing the most ordinary sense of
                    justice or compassion, or the commonest abilities and virtues,« Voltaire could
                    not control his wrath. His <pb n="4"/> letters to the King of Prussia, too, contain violent
                    outbursts of indignation at <emph>Le Système de la Nature</emph>. He did not recognise
                    himself in these disciples and in these conclusions.</p>

                <p>Nevertheless it is Voltaire who constitutes the destructive principle throughout
                    the Revolution, just as it is Rousseau who is the rallying, uniting spirit. For
                    Voltaire had destroyed the principle of authority by vindicating the liberty of
                    thought of the individual, Rousseau had displaced and superseded it by the
                    feeling of universal brotherhood and mutual dependence. What these two great men
                    had planned the Revolution carried into effect; it was the executor of their
                    wills; the thought of the individual became destructive action, and the feeling
                    of mutual dependence, uniting organisation. From Voltaire came the wrath of the
                    revolutionists, from Rousseau their enthusiasm.</p>

                <p>Authority being originally, and in its essence, ecclesiastical and religious, an
                    understanding of the successive developments in the position of the Revolution
                    to church and religion is indispensable to a comprehension of the intellectual
                    reaction which followed. For, as that reaction meant the re-establishment of the
                    principle of authority, it naturally, as well as logically, began with the
                    rehabilitation of the church.</p>

                <p>The Revolution was in reality quite as much of a religious as of a political
                    nature. Regarded from one standpoint, it was the practical result of the labours
                    of the great free-thinking philosophers of the eighteenth century. It is to the
                    Revolution of 1789 that we owe the greatest conquest wrested by the human
                    intellect from prejudice and power–liberty of conscience, religious toleration.
                    It is certainly not to the Christian church that humanity is indebted for this
                    inestimable blessing, for the church opposed to the utmost every demand
                    suggestive of it.</p>

                <p>At the moment when the Revolution begins, all the preparations for the great
                    encounter between the principle of authority on the one side and the principles
                    of individuality and solidarity on the other are complete. All the leaders, all
                    the knights and squires who are to fight in the great joust, are already at
                    their posts, unknown to each other, unknown to the world, which is soon to ring
                    with their names. They are men with very varied pedigrees and pasts. There are
                    noblemen like Mirabeau, priests like Mauret, Fauchet, and Talleyrand, physicians
                    like Marat, lawyers like Robespierre, poets, philosophers, orators, authors like
                    M. J. Chénier, Condorcet, Danton, and <pb n="6"/> Desmoulins–a whole host of men of talent
                    and men of character. The church rallies all its forces for a desperate
                    struggle, in which it is doomed to be worsted; the Revolution progresses, first
                    hesitatingly, then threateningly, then irresistibly, finally in the intoxication
                    of victory. With the summoning of the Estates the lists are opened; challenges
                    are exchanged; and the great umpire, history, gives the signal for the fray.</p>

                <p>As soon as the Estates are assembled the first and unanimous demand of the clergy
                    is that »the Catholic, apostolic, and Roman religion« shall be recognised as the
                    national religion, with the exclusive monopoly of public worship. And yet among
                    the lower orders of the clergy were to be found many republicans; but of the
                    liberty demanded by these, religious liberty did not form a part. The
                    liberal-minded abbés might declaim against the Inquisition, and bestow on it
                    such epithets as cannibal and tiger-like, but they were all opposed to
                    toleration. The revolutionary abbé, Fauchet–he who, after the capture of the
                    Bastille, blessed the tricoloured uniforms of the citizen soldiers, and made of
                    the tricolour the national flag–now jeered at the idea of toleration, and
                    prophesied general and complete demoralisation as its only possible result. He
                    went so far as to maintain that those who belonged to no church ought not to
                    have the right to marry, »since one could not consider such persons bound by
                    their word.«</p>

                <p>When the Estates met as the National Assembly, the clergy were soon compelled to
                    make concessions; but even when the feeling against them found expression, it
                    always in the end assumed the mildest, most deferential form. When, for example,
                    in February 1790, incensed by Garat's declaring consecration to the priesthood
                    to be civic suicide, a number of priests, amongst them Abbé Maury and the
                    Bishops of Nancy and Clermont, started up, accused Garat of blasphemy, and moved
                    that the Catholic religion should be proclaimed as the national religion, the
                    motion was rejected, but in such a manner as clearly evinced the timidity and
                    hesitation of <pb n="7"/> its opponents. It would, they declared, be an insult to religion,
                    and to the feelings of the whole Assembly, to act as if there could be any doubt
                    in such a matter. Men did not yet dare to say what they thought; and so an
                    Assembly, the majority of which were free-thinkers, took part in church
                    processions and attended Catholic public worship. Only two months later the
                    motion that Catholicism should be proclaimed the state religion was again
                    brought forward, this time after Maury's angry tirade against the proposal to
                    secularise the property of the church. The proposer of the motion on this
                    occasion was a priest, Dom Gerle, who afterwards, as a Jacobin, did his utmost
                    to blot out the remembrance of his first public appearance. Mirabeau answered
                    with a reference to a window in the Louvre which he could see from the place
                    where he stood; »the very window,« he shouted, »from which a French autocrat,
                    who combined secular aims with the spiritual aims of religion, fired the shot
                    which gave the signal for the massacre of St. Bartholomew.« But once again the
                    Assembly avoided the settling of the question by declaring that the majesty of
                    religion and the reverence due to it forbade their making it the subject of
                    debate. The Left with one accord refrained from voting and a protest was signed
                    by 297 members, of whom 144 were ecclesiastics. Vacillation and
                    self-contradiction were the order of the day.</p>

                <p>The aristocracy, who a hundred years before had joyfully acclaimed Louis XIV's
                    revocation of the Edict of Nantes, had been influenced to such an extent by the
                    literature of the eighteenth century that, in their capacity as an Estate, they
                    in a genuinely Voltairean spirit expressed themselves in favour of universal
                    toleration; but they at the same time gave hesitating expression to the opinion
                    that the Catholic church ought to be the national church. The Third Estate, the
                    citizens, a considerable proportion of whom were Jansenists, and consequently in
                    reality less liberal-minded, had expressed itself in a similarly evasive manner.
                    But once the National Assembly was constituted, there was no longer any real
                    uncertainty. As we all know, one of the first acts <pb n="8"/> of that Assembly was the
                    Declaration of the Rights of Man, and liberty of thought and speech in matters
                    of religion was specified as one of these rights. Article 10 of the Declaration
                    runs as follows: »No one may be harassed on account of his opinions, not even of
                    his religious opinions, provided his expression of the same be not subversive of
                    lawful order.« The Pope replied by declaring this liberty to be »an unnatural
                    and foolish right, subversive of reason« (<emph>sic</emph>). This was a sufficient
                    indication of the relative positions of the two camps.</p>

                <p>When toleration becomes the subject of debate in the Constituent Assembly we
                    perceive the direction things are taking. One of the clauses in the first
                    draught of the Declaration of the Rights of Man ran thus: »Public worship being
                    a matter of public import, it is the prerogative of society to control it, to
                    permit the rites of one church and forbid those of another.« Upon this clause
                    Mirabeau made a violent attack.</p>

                <p>»It is not toleration that I champion,« he said. »In the matter of religion,
                    unrestricted liberty is in my eyes such a sacred right that the employment of
                    the word toleration to express it savours to me of tyranny; for the very
                    existence of an authority which has the power to tolerate, and, consequently,
                    the power not to do so, is an infringement on freedom of thought.« In a
                    subsequent debate he went still farther. »A ruling religion has been spoken of.
                    What is meant in this case by 'ruling'? I do not understand the word, and must
                    request a definition of it. Does it mean a religion which suppresses other
                    religions? Has not the Assembly interdicted the word suppression? Or does it
                    mean the religion of the sovereign? The sovereign has not the right to rule over
                    men's consciences or to direct their opinions. Or does it apply to the religion
                    of the majority? Religion is a matter of opinion. This or that religion is the
                    outcome of this or that opinion. An opinion is not formed by counting votes.
                    Thought is a man's own, is independent, and cannot be restricted.«</p>

                <p>It is evident that men were beginning to have the courage of their opinions in
                    religious matters.</p>

                <p><pb n="9"/> I adduce another example of the rapidity with which, both in the Assembly and in
                    society in general, they were advancing from a timid first apprehension to
                    certainty of the great spiritual revolution which was taking place.</p>

                <p>In October 1789 there stood at the bar of the National Assembly a deputation of
                    curiously dressed men with oriental features. They were Jews from Alsace and
                    Lorraine, who had been deputed by their fellow-believers to appeal for
                    mercy.</p>

                <p>»Most noble Assembly,« they said, »we come in the name of the Eternal, who is the
                    source of all justice and truth, in the name of God, who has given to all men
                    the same rights and the same duties, in the name of humanity, which has been
                    outraged for centuries by the infamous treatment to which the unfortunate
                    descendants of the oldest of nations have been subjected in almost every
                    country, to beseech you humbly to take our unhappy fate into consideration.
                    Those Jews who are everywhere persecuted, everywhere humiliated, and yet are
                    always submissive, never rebellious; those Jews who are despised and harassed by
                    all nations, whereas they ought to be pitied and tolerated, cast themselves at
                    your feet, and venture to hope that, even in the midst of the important tasks
                    which engross you, you will not neglect and despise their complaint, but will
                    listen compassionately to the timid protests which they venture to offer from
                    the depth of degradation in which they are sunk.... May an improvement in our
                    position, which we have hitherto desired in vain, and which we now tearfully
                    implore, be your work, your benefaction!«</p>

                <p>Clermont-Tonnerre warmly supported this petition. He was opposed by the audacious
                    and callous Abbé Maury, who argued thus: »It is absurd to talk in our days of
                    persecution and intolerance. The Jews are our brothers. But to make the Jews
                    citizens would be equivalent to permitting Englishmen or Danes to become
                    Frenchmen without any process of naturalisation, without ceasing to be
                    Englishmen or Danes.« He also dwelt upon the usurious proclivities of the Jews
                    and the other vices attributed to them: »Not a man amongst them has ennobled his
                    hands by guiding a plough or cultivating a plot of ground.«</p>

                <p><pb n="10"/> Considering that Jews were strictly prohibited by law from acquiring even the
                    smallest piece of land, and that their position was such that when they entered
                    a town they were liable to the same duty as was imposed on pigs, Maury's
                    argument was easy of refutation. But hatred of the Jews was still so strong that
                    no one contradicted him. It was feared that, if civic rights were conferred on
                    the Jews, they would turn the whole of Alsace into a Jewish colony.</p>

                <p>There was a general feeling of embarrassment. Only one member of the Assembly, a
                    man who as yet had attracted no notice, Maximilien Robespierre, spoke in favour
                    of the motion for granting the Jews equality. He declared their vices to be the
                    consequence of the degraded position in which they had been kept.</p>

                <p>But he was alone in supporting a measure which, significantly enough, classed
                    Protestants, actors, and Jews together. The human rights of the Protestants and
                    the actors were acknowledged, but, as Mirabeau recognised the impossibility of
                    passing the clause of the motion which concerned the Jews, he adjourned the
                    debate on this clause indefinitely. Two years passed. In 1791 the Jews once more
                    appealed. But in what a changed tone! The humble prayer of the slave had become
                    the peremptory demand of the man. The conclusion of the appeal runs as
                    follows:–</p>

                <p>»If there were one religion which incapacitated its followers from being
                    citizens, whilst the followers of all other religions made good citizens, then
                    these other religions would be the ruling religions; but there is no ruling
                    religion, since all have equal rights. If the Jews are refused civic rights
                    because they are Jews, they are punished for belonging by birth to a certain
                    religion. In this case there is no religious liberty, seeing that loss of civic
                    rights accompanies the liberty. This much is certain–in advancing men to
                    religious liberty, the intention was that they should simultaneously be advanced
                    to civic liberty; there is no half liberty, just as there is no half
                    justice.«</p>

                <p>Two years spent in the atmosphere of the Revolution <pb n="11"/> had given to these pariahs
                    not only self-esteem but pride. This time the measure was passed without
                    debate.</p>

                <p>In the Constituent Assembly the animosity towards positive religion and its
                    priests with which the »philosophers« had inoculated their age did not find vent
                    in words; as yet it only expressed itself in deeds. All church property was
                    proclaimed to be state property. Voltaire had impressed upon his disciples that
                    it was their mission »to annihilate the infamous thing« (<emph>écraser l'infame</emph>). In
                    the decisions of the Assembly faithful Catholics saw an attempt to carry out
                    this injunction. It seemed to them as if all the powers of hell had been let
                    loose upon the church of Christ, »as if the philosophers were bent upon
                    exterminating the Christian religion, not only in France, but throughout Europe,
                    nay, throughout the whole world.« (<emph>Conjuration contre la religion catholique et
                    les souverains</emph>, 1792.) In order to attain this result the »philosophers« had
                    addressed themselves to the sovereigns of the great countries, to Frederick of
                    Prussia, Catherine of Russia, and others; but it was from the French middle
                    class that the blow came.</p>

                <p>The priests, who, as the saying goes, have found what Archimedes sought, a
                    fulcrum in another world from which to move this one, now began to stir up the
                    spirit of fanaticism in the provinces. In the town of Arras a picture of the
                    crucifixion was paraded in the streets, in which Maury and the royalists were
                    represented standing on the right side of the cross, and the revolutionists on
                    the left side, below the unrepentant thief. At Nîmes there was a regular riot
                    when the news came that a Protestant, Saint-Étienne, had been elected President
                    of the National Assembly.</p>

                <p>The new ordering of the church's affairs was brought about by a coalition of the
                    Voltairean and Jansenist members of the Assembly. The Jansenists had a religious
                    hatred of earthly greatness, and, as fatalists, unquestioningly accepted the
                    existence of human misery. Therefore it displeased them to see the church rich,
                    and they took no account of the manner in which the poor benefited by its
                    wealth. Moreover, the scandalous lives led by many of the high-placed
                    ecclesiastics aroused their moral indignation. Every<pb n="12"/>one, for instance, knew that
                    Bishop Jarante's mistress, Mademoiselle Guimard, distributed ecclesiastical
                    promotion behind the scenes of the opera, that the Archbishop of Narbonne had a
                    regular harem in one of his abbeys, and that the monks of the Abbey of Granselve
                    had quarters for their ladies in a neighbouring village, where the tables were
                    regularly spread for nightly revels.</p>

                <p>If the revolutionists had been content with secularising church property, they
                    could not well have been convicted of attacking religion. But they interfered in
                    the church's internal arrangements and discipline, and even altered its ritual;
                    and its dignitaries naturally proclaimed that the foundations of religion were
                    shaken. Therefore the ordinary priest hardly ever dared take the oath of
                    allegiance to the constitution. The small yearly payment received from the state
                    by those who did so was likened to Judas Iscariot's blood-money, although in
                    times past it had been considered just that bishops should own palaces and
                    pleasure-grounds, and have luxuries of every kind at their disposal, while the
                    lower orders of the clergy were positively starving.</p>

                <p>As a result of the new order of things many riotous and many comic scenes were
                    witnessed in the provinces. In one of Camille Desmoulins' newspaper articles we
                    find an amusing description of the compulsory parting between a village curé and
                    his charge. Coming out at the church door one Sunday after mass, Monsieur le
                    Curé is surprised by the sight of a coach loaded with all his belongings. On the
                    top sits Javotte, his housekeeper, to whom the schoolmaster, with tears in his
                    eyes, is saying farewell. The curé is handed into the carriage amidst cries of:
                    »Good-bye, good-bye, your Reverence!« and off he has to go, though he rages and
                    storms as long as his church steeple is in sight. In other places, however, the
                    priest was forced to take the oath with the bayonet at his breast; and in one
                    instance a recalcitrant was shot dead in his pulpit. But if dissident priests
                    were occasionally maltreated, the treatment meted out by these priests to their
                    opponents was infinitely worse. They taught the peasants that the new
                    constitution, which did not in reality interfere with religion at all, was a
                    work <pb n="13"/> of the devil. They impressed upon their congregations that it was a mortal
                    sin to take the sacrament from the hands of a priest who had sworn allegiance to
                    the government, that the children of parents who had been married by such
                    priests were illegitimate, nay, that the curse of God rested on them. One priest
                    who had taken the oath was stoned in his church, another was hanged from the
                    chancel lamp. The churches which had been closed by order of the National
                    Assembly were broken open again. In certain departments murderous bands of
                    devotees, led by priests, marched about armed with guns and spears. The
                    situation was worst in Brittany. When the Breton peasant who had gone many miles
                    to hear mass said by a true, <emph>i.e.</emph> non-juring priest, on his return met a dozen
                    or so of his neighbours coming out of his own church, where they had been
                    comfortably attending the ministrations of the new government curé, he was so
                    infuriated that he felt justified in committing any of the outrages to which the
                    church incited him.</p>

                <p>By the time the Legislative Assembly met, there were no longer any Estates. The
                    nobles had emigrated, and the exiled ecclesiastical dignitaries were imploring
                    assistance at foreign courts. The lower ranks of the clergy, inspired by
                    anti-revolutionary fanaticism, were inflaming the ignorant multitude. The
                    debates now held in the Assembly were very different in tone from those of the
                    old days. Now the standing grievance against religion was the naïvely formulated
                    one that it did not harmonise with the constitution, and that against the
                    clergy, that their one aim was to recover their property. The lies and violence
                    of the priests had stirred up a feeling of great bitterness against them. A few
                    conciliatory voices were heard, such as that of André Chénier, who maintained
                    that the priests did not trouble the state when the state did not interfere with
                    them, or Talleyrand, who insisted that, as no form of religion was prescribed by
                    law, neither should any be prohibited by law; but Voltairean indignation was
                    long the order of the day.</p>

                <p>These were the halcyon days of the Girondists, and the <pb n="14"/> Girondists were the
                    practical expression of the ideas of Voltaire.</p>

                <p>In a public declaration drawn up by their famous leader, Vergniaud, we read: »The
                    rebellious priests are preparing a revolt against the constitution; these
                    insolent myrmidons of absolutism are supplicating all the sovereigns of Europe
                    for money and soldiers wherewith to reconquer the sceptre of France.« Roland, as
                    Minister of the Interior, said: »Mutinous and hypocritical priests, concealing
                    their plans and their passions under the sacred veil of religion, do not
                    hesitate to excite fanaticism and to arm their misguided fellow-citizens with
                    the sword of intolerance.« When the proposal to banish the priests was under
                    discussion, Vergniaud spoke, half jestingly, half seriously, of the iniquity of
                    bringing evil upon other countries by sending them such a gift. »Generally
                    speaking,« he maintained, »nothing can be more immoral than that one country
                    should send into another the criminals of whom it desires to be rid.« But he
                    comforts himself with the idea that in Italy they will be received as saints,
                    and that »in this gift of living saints which we are sending him, the Pope will
                    recognise a humble attempt to express our gratitude for all the arms, legs, and
                    other relics of dead saints with which he has favoured our pious credulity
                    during the centuries gone by.«</p>

                <p>»Yes,« cries Isnard, the future President of the Convention, »let us send these
                    plague-stricken creatures to the hospitals of Italy.« And he adds that when a
                    priest is depraved, he is never partly, but always wholly depraved, that to
                    forgive crimes is the same as to commit them, that an end must be put to the
                    existing state of matters, and that the enemies of the Revolution are themselves
                    compelling the Revolution to crush them. From his lips issue for the first time
                    the terrible words which were to be echoed and re-echoed times without number in
                    days to come: »There is no need of proofs.« That is to say, all priests accused
                    were at once to be banished.</p>

                <p>And when the fear was expressed that such proceedings would result in civil war,
                    the noted Girondist, Guadet, a disciple of Holbach, reassured the Assembly with
                    a speech con<pb n="15"/>taining the following assertion: »Every one knows that a priest is
                    as cowardly as he is covetous, that he wields no weapons but those of
                    superstition, and that, having fought nowhere but in the theological prize-ring,
                    he is a nonentity on the field of battle.« It was soon seen how mistaken, in
                    this matter at least, Guadet and his sympathisers were, and what bold,
                    enthusiastic leaders the priests made in the sanguinary civil war which
                    ensued.</p>

                <p>Things reached such a pitch that speakers actually began to excuse themselves
                    when they were obliged to address the Assembly on church matters. François de
                    Nantes (as spokesman of a committee, be it noted) declares: »Our one consolation
                    in being obliged to take up your time with the discussion of church matters is
                    the hope that the measures you will take will prevent the necessity of your ever
                    hearing of them again.« His whole speech is a tissue of audacities.</p>

                <p>These sentiments were shared by high and low. One of Louis XVI.'s ministers, the
                    insolent, high-handed Cahier de Gerville, said one day, on leaving the council
                    chamber, to his colleague Molleville, who noted down the expression in his
                    Memoirs: »I wish I had these damned vermin, the clergy of all lands, between my
                    fingers, that I might squeeze them all to death at once.« But the spirit of the
                    Revolution found temperate, dignified expression in a letter from the Republic
                    to the Pope, which a woman had been commissioned to write. It is addressed to
                    »The Prince-Bishop in Rome.« In the name of the Republic Madame Roland writes:
                    »High-priest of the Roman church, sovereign of a state which is slipping out of
                    your hands, know that the only possible way in which you can preserve state and
                    church is by making a disinterested confession and proclamation of those gospel
                    principles which breathe a spirit of the purest democracy, the tenderest
                    humanity, and the most perfect equality–principles with which Christ's
                    representatives have adorned themselves only for the purpose of supporting and
                    increasing a sovereign power which is now falling to pieces from decrepitude.
                    The age of ignorance is past.«</p>

                <p>But such language as this is quite out of keeping with what was generally spoken
                    and written. The period of <pb n="16"/> calm conviction was at an end, that of unbridled
                    passions had begun. The passions followed in the track of the convictions.
                    Hatred of Catholicism reached its climax; it broke out in one great flame all
                    over France. Those were the golden days of the Clubs.</p>

                <p>The Cordelier Club held its meetings in the chapel of a monastery. All the
                    paintings, tapestries, and carvings were torn down; nothing but the skeleton of
                    the church remained. The president's seat was in the chancel, where the rain
                    blew in through the broken panes of the east window. His table was composed of
                    joiners' benches; on it lay a row of red caps, and whoever wished to speak had
                    to put on one of these. Behind him was a statue of Liberty with broken
                    instruments of torture in her hands. Planks, fragments of stalls, of church
                    benches, or of shattered images provided seats for a dirty, wild audience in
                    ragged <emph>carmagnoles</emph> (as their jackets were called), shouldering spears, or
                    sitting with their bare arms crossed. The orators spoke boldly and to the point;
                    everything was called by its plainest name; an indecent word or audacious
                    gesture roused applause. They were often interrupted by opponents, and at times
                    by the screeching of small owls, which had been driven from their homes under
                    the monastery roof, and now flew in and out through the broken windows seeking
                    food. These were not to be silenced by the chairman's bell; they were sometimes
                    shot, and fell fluttering and bleeding among the crowd. Among the speakers were
                    Danton, Marat, and Camille Desmoulins–the amiable, witty Camille, whose
                    moderation brought upon him the charge of hypocrisy, and who even before the
                    tribunal of the Revolution spoke of the <emph>sans-culotte</emph>, Jesus. Camille had
                    private reasons for his hatred of the priests. When, in December 1790, he wished
                    to marry his beloved Lucile, without doubt one of the purest and most beautiful
                    of the female characters of the Revolution, no priest would perform the ceremony
                    because he had written in a newspaper article that the religion of Mahomet was
                    as intelligible as the religion of Jesus. He was obliged to recant this
                    assertion and to go to confession before he could be married. <pb n="17"/> But now he made
                    amends. In his newspaper, <emph>Le vieux Cordelier</emph>, he wrote: »The whole subject of
                    priests and of religions is disposed of when it has been said that they resemble
                    each other in all being equally absurd, and when it has been instanced that the
                    Tatars eat the excrement of the Grand Lama as the greatest delicacy. There is no
                    fool too foolish to be honoured as Jupiter's equal. The Mongolians worship a
                    cow, which is the object of as many genuflexions as the god Apis.... We have not
                    the right to be aggravated by such follies, we who in our simplicity have so
                    long allowed ourselves to be persuaded that it is possible to swallow a god as
                    one swallows an oyster.« An influential paper which had a great circulation
                    among the Cordeliers was Loustalot's <emph>Les Révolutions de Paris</emph>. One of its
                    numbers, published during Lent 1792, contained the following tirade, apropos of
                    the shows at the fair: »In the days when there was a ruling religion in France,
                    the tonsured jugglers allowed no competition during Holy Week. They alone might
                    give performances. Now there is free competition. When the ordinary conjurer
                    shows himself upon his stage he is attired in a cloak and strange headgear, by
                    which he is distinguished from the surrounding crowd; but as soon as the
                    performance is over he takes off his costume. The priest wears his all day long,
                    and performs his part off as well as on the stage.... When will they blush to
                    play the rôle of the harlequins of humanity?« Henceforward the revolutionary
                    nickname of the priests is »theophagi.« In the month of April the same newspaper
                    contains an article in which it is proposed to apply to priests the regulations
                    instituted by Johanna of Naples for the control of women of ill-fame. »They
                    ought to be shut up in a house where they can preach and pray as much as they
                    choose for those who seek them there, but should be prohibited from going
                    abroad, so that they may not infect the population.« The wine of Voltaire has
                    turned into vinegar, into poison.</p>

                <p>A rival club of a very different type from the Cordeliers' was the Jacobins'. Its
                    intellectual tendency was more serious and more pedantic. Its patron was
                    Rousseau, as <pb n="18"/> its rival's was Voltaire. The original programme of the
                    Jacobins–love of equality, hatred of all established inequality–was derived
                    purely from Rousseau; with it they managed to combine ambition, a cold,
                    calculating, revolutionary spirit of persecution, and, underlying everything
                    else, devotion to rule, that is to say, to the regulation of society according
                    to Rousseau's principles.</p>

                <p>To the student who observes historic phenomena from the literary point of view,
                    nothing in the history of the Revolution is more striking than the distinct
                    manner in which all its men of action and of words acknowledge the literature of
                    the eighteenth century to be the mainspring of their actions and utterances.
                    They seem to seek no other honour than that of transforming ready-made
                    principles into action. At Mirabeau's grave it was told to his honour that he
                    had said of the philosophers: »They have produced light; I will produce
                    movement.« And there is scarcely a paragraph in the <emph>Contrat Social</emph> which did
                    not, during the course of the Revolution, reappear either in a law, or a public
                    declaration, or a newspaper article, or a speech in the National Assembly, or in
                    the very constitution of the Republic itself.</p>

                <p>The most important of its theories–that power emanates from the people, that law
                    is the expression of their will–is to be found literally reproduced in the
                    Declaration of the Rights of Man. As soon as the idea of association occurs to
                    the Jacobins they instantaneously trace it back to Rousseau, and employ all his
                    phraseology. Abbé Fauchet writes, in an article in <emph>La Bouche de Fer</emph>: »Great
                    Rousseau, of the candid mind and feeling heart! thou art one of the first to
                    have understood the eternal laws of equity. Yes; every man has a right to the
                    earth, has a right of property in what he requires for his support.« And he goes
                    on to maintain that the social contract is a contract between the man and his
                    country. Saint-Just expresses himself in almost the same words in his speech
                    demanding the death of Louis XVI.: »The social contract is a contract which the
                    citizens conclude with one another, and not a contract with the government. Men
                    have no responsibility in the matter of a <pb n="19"/> contract into which they have not
                    entered.« But it is Robespierre who, as leader of the Jacobins, gives typical
                    expression to their devotion to the principles of Rousseau. He was the first
                    enemy of the Girondist rationalism; hence we find him, at the time when this
                    rationalism was most distinctly proving its destructive tendency, declaring in a
                    charge to the Jacobins that the Revolution is under the direction of God, is in
                    fact His work. He felt impelled to give his revolutionary sentimentality this
                    affected expression, which implied its relationship with what was called
                    »natural religion.«</p>

                <p>It was not this feeling, but the spirit of contemptuous indignation awakened by
                    Voltaire, which, towards the middle of the year 1792, became the dominant
                    feeling in the Legislative Assembly and in France. In August the edict was
                    passed which condemned all refractory priests to banishment to one of the
                    colonies. Arrests of such priests took place every day. Then came the September
                    slaughter. The imprisoned priests were the first to fall. Abbé Baruel writes:
                    »These executioners did not all belong to the dregs of the people. A man shouted
                    to the priests who were being murdered: 'Scoundrels, murderers, monsters,
                    contemptible hypocrites! the day of vengeance has come at last. No longer shall
                    you delude the people with your masses, your scrap of bread upon the altar!'«
                    The fortitude displayed by most of the priests is worthy of all admiration. In
                    the prison of the Carmelite Convent, 172 of them unhesitatingly elected to be
                    shot rather than take the oath of allegiance to the constitution. It is touching
                    to read the description of the composure of those who were locked into the
                    church: »From time to time we sent some of our comrades up to the window in the
                    tower, to look in what posture the unfortunate men who were being sacrificed in
                    the courtyard were meeting their fate, so that we might know how to conduct
                    ourselves when our turn came. They told us that those who stretched out their
                    arms suffered longest, because the sword-blows slackened before they reached the
                    head« (Jourgniac de Saint-Méard.) In all, 1480 human beings were butchered. The
                    number is unques<pb n="20"/>tionably an appalling one; but it is to be noted, as not without
                    interest, that, according to Michelet's calculation, the number of men (and
                    women) executed between the beginning and the end of the Revolution does not
                    amount to a fortieth part of the number killed in the battle of the Moskwa
                    alone.</p>

                <p>The hatred which had found such ferocious expression in the Days of September had
                    not cooled down when the Convention assembled. Let us see what the member of
                    Convention writes, reads, and says on the subject of priests and religion. One
                    of them, Lequinio by name, presents his colleagues with a book which he has
                    written and dedicated to the Pope. Its title is <emph>Les Préjugés Détruits</emph>. In it
                    we read: »Religion is a political chain invented for the purpose of fettering
                    men; its only use has been to ensure the pleasures of a few individuals by
                    holding all the others in check.« The tirades against the priests in this book
                    surpass in violence and indecency any yet published. Amongst its mildest
                    affirmations concerning them is one perpetually made at this time, with all
                    manner of variations: »When they are honest, they are stupid or mad; as a rule
                    they are audacious impostors, veritable assassins of the human race.« We must go
                    to Kierkegaard's <emph>Öieblikket</emph> (The Moment) to find outbursts corresponding to
                    this. Such is the literature of the day. And Lequinio is not to be regarded as
                    an exception, though he carried his war with prejudice to the extent of inviting
                    the public executioner to dine with him and his family for the purpose of
                    overcoming the prejudice against that official. In <emph>Les Révolutions de Paris</emph>,
                    the newspaper which the member of Convention perused before he went forth to
                    take his part in the debates of the day, he read one morning in December 1792,
                    apropos of the celebration of the midnight mass in Paris: »There is no
                    particular harm in holding exhibitions of dancing marionettes or conjurers'
                    tricks in the public streets in the light of day; it is quite permissible that
                    children and nurses should be amused. But to meet in dark assembly halls at
                    night for the purpose of singing hymns, lighting tapers, and burning incense in
                    honour of an illegitimate child and an unfaithful wife is a scandal, an offence <pb n="21"/> against public morality, which demands the attention of the police and strict
                    repressive measures.«<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Louis Blanc (in his <emph>Histoire de la Révolution</emph>, viii. 35) has misunderstood
                        this article. He takes the unfaithful wife and illegitimate son to mean Marie
                        Antoinette and the Dauphin. A note in the original text has escaped his
                        observation; it is to the effect that the »founders of the three greatest
                        religions were bastards.«</note> Previously quoted utterances have been aglow with
                    exasperation, hatred, and scorn; but as yet they have not been ribald. They were
                    the revengeful cries of that human reason which had been so long fettered and
                    tortured. This language is scurrilous. And there is another change. Those who
                    have hitherto been oppressed are betraying a marked inclination in their turn to
                    play the part of oppressors.</p>

                <p>Action followed swiftly upon resolve. »They proceeded,« writes Mercier in <emph>Le
                    nouveau Paris</emph>, »to the destruction of everything connected with the old
                    worship, not with the frenzy of zealotry, but with an ironical contempt and
                    uncontrolled mirth which could not but astound the onlooker.« The churches were
                    positively ravaged. One troop of its emissaries communicated to the Convention
                    that they had »permitted 'brown Mary' (a certain miracle-working image) to
                    retire, after all the hard work she had had in fooling the world for 1800
                    years.« The altars were plundered for the benefit of the treasury of the
                    Republic. Here is a fragment of a report: »There are no longer any priests in
                    the Department of Nièvre. The altars have been despoiled of the piles of gold
                    which ministered to priestly vanity. Thirty millions worth of valuable articles
                    will be sent to Paris. Two carts laden with crucifixes, gold croziers, and two
                    millions in gold coin, have already arrived at the Mint. Three times as much
                    will immediately follow.«</p>

                <p>Sometimes the carts stopped at the door of the assembly hall of the Convention,
                    and sacks full of gold and silver were piled up in the hall itself.</p>

                <p>Another report is in the ironical style. »I have been unjustly accused of an
                    onslaught on religion. The fact is that I asked most politely before I acted,
                    and three or four hundred saints begged for permission to go to the Mint. <pb n="22"/> The
                    language employed on the occasion was something in this style: 'Ye who have been
                    the tools of fanaticism, ye saints and holy ones of every description, show now
                    that ye are patriots, and help your country by marching to the Mint!'«</p>

                <p>In a third report the delegates congratulate themselves on the result of their
                    »philosophic mission« in the Department of Gers. »Public feeling was ripe, and
                    it was decided that the abolition of fanaticism should be solemnly celebrated on
                    the last day of the third Decade. The whole population assembled in a rustic
                    spot to hold the festival of brotherhood. After a Spartan meal they hurried into
                    the town, tore down all the emblems of fanaticism, and trampled them under foot.
                    A scavenger's cart drove up, bringing two miracle-working virgins and a variety
                    of crucifixes and images of saints, to which, but a short time before,
                    superstition had offered incense. All this ridiculous rubbish was piled upon a
                    bonfire, on which already lay a collection of patents of nobility, and burned
                    amidst the rejoicings of an enormous crowd. Round this philosophic pyre on which
                    so many delusions were consumed the <emph>carmagnole</emph> was danced all night.«</p>

                <p>In a fourth report we read: »Sixty-four refractory priests were living in a house
                    belonging to the people. I ordered them to be marched through the town to
                    prison. The new kind of monster, which had not as yet been exhibited to the gaze
                    of the public, produced an excellent effect. Shouts of 'Vive la République!'
                    rose from the crowd that surrounded the herd. Have the goodness to let me know
                    what I am to do with the five dozen animals whom I have held up to the ridicule
                    of the multitude. I gave them actors as an escort.«</p>

                <p>The debates which preceded the proclamation of religious liberty on the 3rd
                    Ventôse of the year III. were all in this same tone. However divided the
                    Convention might be upon other questions, upon this there was absolute
                    unanimity. Marked as is the difference in the nation's frame of mind during, and
                    after, the Reign of Terror, there is no difference in its attitude towards
                    Catholicism. When, as one result of the proclamation of religious liberty, a few <pb n="23"/> churches had been reopened, the fact was announced by the weekly paper <emph>Le
                    Décade Philosophique</emph>, under the heading »Theatres,« in the following terms: »On
                    the 18th and 25th of this month a comedy was played in several parts of Paris.
                    The chief character, in an absurd costume, performed a variety of foolish
                    antics, at which the spectators did not laugh. As we are not in the habit of
                    criticising revived plays when they are neither useful nor instructive, we shall
                    take no further notice of this one.«</p>

                <p>Mirabeau had said that men's first aim must be »to decatholicise« France. To all
                    appearance this was being done. One Commune after another petitioned to be
                    allowed to change its name, which was almost always that of some saint.
                    Saint-Denis, for instance (whose headless patron never existed), was renamed
                    Franciade. Most of the provinces followed the example of Paris. Nothing that
                    could remind men of the »kingdom by the grace of God« was spared. In 1793 a
                    venerable, white-bearded Alsatian, a member of the Committee of Public Safety,
                    Ruhl by name, managed to get possession of the sacred, miracle-working ampulla
                    containing the anointing oil which a dove had brought down from heaven on the
                    occasion of the coronation of Clovis. Followed by a vast crowd, he bore it in
                    triumph to the great square of Reims, where the magistrates and other public
                    officials had already assembled round the statue of Louis XV. Here he delivered
                    an oration against tyranny and tyrants, and wound up by throwing the sacred
                    vessel at the head of Louis le Bien-aimé with such violence that it broke into a
                    hundred pieces, and the sacred oil trickled once again down the cheeks of the
                    Lord's Anointed.</p>

                <p>Events such as these, and language such as the above quoted, show plainly enough
                    how determinedly the Revolution was attacking the principle of authority. It was
                    highly significant that patents of nobility were burned in the same bonfire with
                    the images of the saints, and that disbelief in the sacred ampulla led to the
                    flouting of royalty. From the moment when the authority of religion was
                    overthrown, the magic power of authority in every domain was gone.</p>

                <p><pb n="24"/> It was supplanted by the watchword: Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity. But this
                    watchword contained at least two fundamental principles instead of one. Liberty
                    as a fundamental principle may be regarded as emanating from Voltaire,
                    fraternity from Rousseau. And equality and liberty did not combine well. When,
                    not long before the Revolution, Saint-Martin, the mystic, proclaimed his
                    mysterious doctrine of the Holy Trinity (Ternaire)–liberty, equality, and
                    fraternity, which always had been, and always should be–he did not foresee the
                    possibility of disunion, of conflict, between these principles. Voltaire says
                    somewhere: »It was a wise provision that made of the Trinity one God; if there
                    had been three they would have come to blows.« In 1793 Saint-Martin's trinity
                    revealed the contradictions which lay latent in it.</p>

                <p>In the month of April the new Declaration of the Rights of Man which Robespierre
                    had drawn up and persuaded the Jacobins to accept as their programme was
                    published, and in the same month, whilst the violent dispute between Robespierre
                    and Vergniaud was going on, there emanated from the opposite camp the plan of a
                    constitution, evolved by Condorcet, Barrère, Thomas Paine, Pétion, Barbaroux,
                    Sièyes, and others, and drawn up by Condorcet.</p>

                <p>If we place these two documents side by side, we have before us in embryo the two
                    ideas which in the future were to struggle for the mastery, namely, the idea of
                    liberalism and the idea of socialism, the former derived from Voltaire, the
                    latter from Rousseau. As the two programmes deal point by point with the same
                    subjects, the difference strikes us here as it does nowhere else.</p>

                <p>In the first years of the Revolution there had been no mention of socialism. Men
                    aimed at freeing capital from unjust burdens, not at limiting its power. This is
                    clearly shown by the fact that the first proof which the victorious bourgeoisie
                    gave of their authority after the storming of the Bastille was the publication
                    of a decree that the printers were to be held responsible for every book or
                    pamphlet published by writers without known means of subsistence (<emph>sans
                        existence connue</emph>). This regulation was published on the <pb n="25"/> 24th of July 1789,
                    exactly ten days after the capture of the Bastille. The bourgeoisie took care,
                    as soon as they had mounted themselves, to draw the ladder up after them. Their
                    first act, when they had won their own place by the aid of the pen, was to take
                    the pen out of the hand of the classes below them.</p>

                <p>The Convention, nourished on the ideas of Rousseau and Mably, comprehended that
                    inequality within the citizen society was the worst enemy of political equality,
                    and dreamed of producing equality by giving property to all. Condorcet wished to
                    devote the funds at the disposal of the state, not to the abolishment of private
                    property, but to the equalisation of any excessive disproportion in the
                    distribution of worldly possessions. Right of succession was to be abolished,
                    the means of education were to be made accessible to all, &amp;c, &amp;c. It was
                    not till the owners of property began, after the fall of Robespierre, to resist
                    the claims of those who owned nothing, that the attack on property as such was
                    made. Babeuf's communistic conspiracy followed. The conspiracy was betrayed and
                    defeated, drowned in the blood of the conspirators without a voice being raised
                    in defence of the ideas which had inspired it. Socialism did no more than put
                    out feelers at the time of the Revolution.</p>

                <p>Whilst the Girondists' Declaration of the Rights of Man ensures first and
                    foremost the rights of the individual–freedom of conscience and of thought
                    (<emph>les franchises de la pensée</emph> was the expression in those days), the
                    inviolability of the home, equality in sight of the law, the proportioning of
                    punishment to crime–the Jacobins in every matter insist upon the responsibility
                    of human beings for each other and the duty entailed by brotherhood.</p>

                <p>The Girondists laid down the principle of non-interference. The Jacobins taught:
                    The men of all countries are brothers, and the different nations ought to help
                    each other to the best of their ability, like citizens of the same state. The
                    nation which oppresses another nation declares itself the enemy of all. Those
                    who make war upon any one nation in order to arrest the progress of liberty and
                    abolish the <pb n="26"/> rights of humanity ought to be assailed by all the others, not as
                    ordinary enemies, but as insurrectionary murderers and robbers.</p>

                <p>The Girondists opposed every tyranny in human shape, but they seldom tried to
                    protect from the tyranny of circumstances. Their work was for the most part of a
                    negative nature. The Jacobins perceived more clearly the uselessness of
                    bestowing on the sick the right to be cured without curing them, the mockery in
                    solemnly conferring on the lame the right to walk. Yet there was no essential
                    difference between them. Condorcet the Girondist felt as strongly as any Jacobin
                    that free competition was a lie when in the race one man was mounted on an
                    excellent horse while the other had to run barefoot.</p>

                <p>It was the feeling of duty to society (as defined by Rousseau) which led to
                    Robespierre's significant intervention in the war between the Revolution and
                    positive religion. Once the Revolution had broken into the churches axe in hand,
                    it seemed as if the movement were irresistible. Men mounted on the frailest of
                    scaffolding to scrape from the ceilings of churches portraits of popes concealed
                    by century-old spiders' webs. Images of saints were torn from their niches, and
                    fanaticism destroyed some of the finest works of Gothic art; the emissaries of
                    the Revolution descended even into the vaults, and flashed their lanterns in the
                    pale faces of the dead; fragments of broken-up altars were piled together »like
                    shapeless stones in a quarry.« The chairmen of the revolutionary committees wore
                    velvet breeches made out of episcopal robes, and shirts cut out of choristers'
                    surplices. In the end a few atheistic enthusiasts (Anacharsis Clootz, a man of
                    German extraction, Chaumette, and Hébert) made their voices heard, and carried
                    the mob with them in their iconoclastic fury.</p>

                <p>Except on this occasion we hear as little of atheism during the Revolution as of
                    socialism. Belief in God and immortality, the common creed of Voltaire and
                    Rousseau, is the creed held unchanged by almost all the chosen leaders of the
                    people. And this same belief pervades all the writings <pb n="27"/> of the period. Thomas
                    Paine's <emph>Age of Reason</emph> is a good example. Even such a recklessly disreputable
                    poem as Parny's <emph>Guerre des Dieux</emph> inculcates the same doctrine, Camille
                    Desmoulins writes in a letter: »Mon cher Manuel! Les rois sont mûrs, mais le bon
                    Dieu ne l'est pas encore (notez que je dis <emph>le bon Dieu</emph> et non pas <emph>Dieu</emph>, ce
                    qui est fort différent).« This is the standpoint of the age; its task was not to
                    subject the conception of God to criticism, but to free it from the legendary
                    encumbrances of the positive religions. The atheists in the National Assembly
                    led the Revolution beyond its proper goal and instigated excesses which degraded
                    it in the eyes of the contemporary generation.</p>

                <p>Clootz succeeded in persuading a bishop, Gobel by name, to write a letter to the
                    Convention, which began: »Citizens, representatives! I am a priest, that is to
                    say, a quack. Hitherto I have been an honest quack; I have only deceived because
                    I myself was deceived.« It ended, of course, with the information that he had
                    become converted to philosophy.</p>

                <p>Chaumette, an enthusiast, who had procured the abolition of corporal punishment
                    in educational institutions and of legally regulated prostitution, persuaded the
                    Commune to consecrate the cathedral of Notre Dame to »the worship of Reason.«
                    Within the church was erected a temple with the inscription <emph>À la Philosophie</emph>,
                    the porch of which was decorated with busts of the great philosophers. On the
                    dedication day, when the door was thrown open, a young actress, Mademoiselle
                    Candeille, representing Liberty, issued forth, and a hymn to Liberty, written by
                    Marie-Joseph Chénier and set to music by Gossec, composer to the Republic, was
                    sung in her honour. On another occasion Mademoiselle Maillard of the Opera, a
                    stately and beautiful woman, chosen to represent the goddess of Reason, was
                    carried shoulder-high out of the old cathedral in a chair decked with garlands
                    of oak leaves and was escorted by trumpeters, a crowd of red-capped citizens,
                    and a number of members of the Convention, to the assembly hall of that body,
                    whose president solemnly impressed a kiss on her brow. But these ceremonies,
                    innocent in themselves, were <pb n="28"/> degraded by the ribald manner in which they were
                    imitated by the mob. Women of bad character had themselves carried in triumphal
                    processions as goddesses of Reason. Wild revels were held in churches; the
                    church of Saint-Eustache was actually turned into a tavern. The relics of Saint
                    Geneviève were burned, and such a bonfire of wooden images of saints,
                    prayer-books, and Old and New Testaments was lit on the Place de la Grève that
                    the flames rose to the second stories of the houses.</p>

                <p>Clootz was elected president of the Jacobin Club. Hereupon Robespierre, as a good
                    disciple of Rousseau, and with his eye on Europe, prevailed on the Convention to
                    issue a public declaration that the French people acknowledged the existence of
                    the Supreme Being; and he moreover persuaded the Jacobins to present a petition
                    to the Convention, praying that assembly to do all that was in its power to
                    restore belief in God and in the immortality of the soul. He denounced the
                    iconoclasts as fanatics of the Catholic type, and atheism as aristocratic. When,
                    in May 1794, he mounted the tribune to urge the Convention to celebrate a
                    festival in honour of the Supreme Being, he proceeded, after saying a few
                    enthusiastic words in praise of Rousseau, to make a deliberate attack on
                    Christianity. »All men's imaginings disappear in presence of the truth, and all
                    follies succumb to reason.... What have the priests to do with God? The position
                    of priests to morality is the same as that of quacks to the science of
                    medicine.« Assuming, in the manner of his century, that religions are the
                    inventions of their priests, he says: »The priests have made of God a fire-ball,
                    a bull, a tree, a man, a king. The Supreme Being's true priest is nature, his
                    temple the universe, his worship virtue.« He goes on to show that priests have
                    everywhere supported tyranny: »It is you who have said to kings: Ye are the
                    representatives of God on earth; it is from Him ye hold your authority! And the
                    kings in their turn have said to you: In very truth ye are God's messengers; let
                    us divide the incense and the spoils!«</p>

                <p>The result of these endeavours was the Conven<pb n="29"/>tion's proclamation to all the
                    nations of the earth that it countenanced free worship of God, and that it
                    censured »the excesses of philosophy as strongly as the crimes of fanaticism.«
                    One paragraph of this proclamation runs: »Your rulers will tell you that the
                    French nation has banished all religions and has ordained the worship of certain
                    men instead of the worship of the Deity; they represent us to you as an
                    idolatrous and insane people. They lie. The French people and its
                    representatives favour liberty of worship of every kind.« It was decided to
                    celebrate a certain number of religious festivals–the festivals of liberty, of
                    equality, of humanity, one in honour of the great men who in their day had been
                    liberators, &amp;c.,&amp;c.</p>

                <p>The first outcome of this decision was the famous festival in honour of the
                    Supreme Being. There is something touchingly comic in the childishness of the
                    whole proceeding. With a bouquet of flowers and ears of wheat in his hand,
                    Robespierre, elected president for the day, led the assembled Convention through
                    Paris to the Champ de Mars. On its march it was encircled by a tricoloured
                    ribbon carried by children, youths, middle-aged and old men, decked according to
                    their age with violets, myrtle, oak, or vine leaves. Every member of the
                    Convention wore a tricoloured scarf and carried a bouquet of flowers, fruits,
                    and ears of corn. When they had taken their places in the space reserved for
                    them on the highest part of the plain, a ceremony was proceeded with, which,
                    according to the testimony of eye-witnesses, was impressive, though somewhat
                    theatrical. An invocation of the Most High was sung by thousands of voices. The
                    young girls strewed flowers, the young men brandished their weapons and swore
                    that they would save France and liberty. The rites concluded with a performance
                    in the taste of the day. In a conspicuous position stood a group of monsters
                    specially designed by the famous painter, David–impiety, selfishness, disunion,
                    and ambition, evil things which were to be exterminated from the earth
                    henceforth and for ever. Robespierre seized a torch and flung it at the
                    monsters. As they had been drenched with turpentine they burned <pb n="30"/> up at once, and
                    in their place there appeared an incombustible statue of Wisdom. A curious irony
                    of fate willed it that this statue should be completely blackened by the flames
                    and smoke.</p>

                <p>The festival in honour of the Supreme Being was an ingenuous expression of the
                    piety of the eighteenth century. Robespierre was perfectly right in lamenting
                    that Rousseau had not lived to see that day; it would have been a festival after
                    his own heart. And so firmly were these religious ideas rooted in the minds of
                    the legislators that they stood when Robespierre fell. The »citizen« religion
                    instituted by the Convention was not of his evolving. Far from turning back
                    after his death, men pressed eagerly onwards. The Republican calendar was
                    introduced. As »the Christian era had been the era of lies, deception, and
                    charlatanism.« the Christian reckoning was abolished; time was reckoned from
                    1792, the week was superseded by the decade, and it was proposed to give to the
                    various saints' days the names of agricultural implements and useful domestic
                    animals.</p>

                <p>Ere long regular liturgies and catechisms of the new religion were published. In
                    one such book (<emph>Office des décadis en discours, hymnes et prières en usage dans
                    les temples de la Raison</emph>) we read:–</p>

                <p>»Liberty, thou supreme happiness of man upon earth, hallowed be thy name by all
                    nations throughout the world! May thy joy-bringing kingdom come and put an end
                    to the reign of tyrants! May thy holy worship take the place of the worship of
                    those miserable idols whose altars thou hast overthrown!... I believe in a
                    Supreme Being who has created men free and equal, who has formed them to love
                    one another and not to hate one another, who desires to be honoured by the
                    exhibition of virtue, not of fanaticism, and in whose eyes the noblest of
                    worships is the worship of truth and reason. I believe in the approaching fall
                    of all tyrants, in the regeneration of morality, the ever-increasing spread of
                    all the virtues, and the eternal triumph of liberty.«</p>

                <p>Simultaneously, however, men confessed their faith in other and less innocent
                    ways. The churches were dis<pb n="31"/>mantled to serve the purposes of the new religion.
                    Practical reasons made the abolition of Sunday a vital question; ere long
                    suspicion attached to every one who observed it–and in those days it was
                    dangerous to be suspected. The violent attempts made during the rule of the
                    Convention to prevent the observance of Sunday constituted a new species of
                    tyranny, which, although more excusable than the tyranny it superseded, was no
                    less barbarous and unreasonable.</p>

                <p>Even under the Directory, when the first symptoms of a reactionary movement in
                    the lower ranks of society were already perceptible, there were, as we are told
                    by a writer of the day, members of Assembly who had nervous attacks if they as
                    much as heard the word »priest«; and the work of destruction was carried on with
                    avidity. »Every man,« says Laurent, »who had a drop of revolutionary blood in
                    his veins laboured with feverish enthusiasm at the destruction of Christianity.«
                    In official reports the faithful Catholics are described as »weak-minded.« A
                    proclamation of the Directory relating to the elections of the year VI. declares
                    that it is necessary to erase from the lists »the unhappy fanatics, who are
                    blinded by credulity, and who might take it into their heads to throw themselves
                    once more at the feet of the priests.«</p>

                <p>The priests had continued to be the most terrible enemies of the Revolution. The
                    bloody war in La Vendée was to a great extent their work. The horrors
                    perpetrated during this struggle recall those of the Middle Ages. One priest who
                    had sworn allegiance to the constitution was stoned to death by yelling women,
                    and another was torn to pieces, also by women. Before the Republican President,
                    Joubert, was killed, his hands were sawn off. In one town the Royalists buried
                    their revolutionary enemies alive; when the Republican troops arrived they saw
                    arms sticking up out of the ground, the hands clenching the turf.</p>

                <p>The revolutionists were soon compelled to acknowledge that their proceedings had
                    had the opposite effect to what they had wished and expected. Significantly
                    enough, the envoys sent to La Vendée were the first to advise complete <pb n="32"/> separation of church from state. In their opinion this was the only means of
                    tranquillising men's minds and restoring the country to peace. As far back as
                    the days of the Legislative Assembly it had been proposed by a priest that the
                    state should cease to subsidise any religion. But men were too excited then to
                    refrain from violent espousal of one side or the other. The revolutionists
                    hoped, as they often said, »to put an end to all sectarianism« by the aid of
                    universal education. They fondly imagined that the era of dogmas was past, that
                    the time had come when, in the words of Jefferson, the American, the miraculous
                    conception of Christ in the womb of a virgin was to be classed along with the
                    miraculous conception of Minerva in the head of Jupiter. In a report drawn up
                    under the Convention we read: »Soon men will only make acquaintance with these
                    foolish dogmas, the offspring of fear and delusion, to despise them. Soon the
                    religion of Socrates, Marcus Aurelius, and Cicero will be the religion of the
                    world.« And when, in her Memoirs, Madame Roland has occasion to use the word
                    »catechism,« she considers it necessary to explain it for the benefit of
                    posterity. She writes: »So rapidly are things moving now that the readers of
                    this passage will perhaps ask: What was that? I will tell them.«</p>

                <p>The men of the Revolution had failed to comprehend that the great body of the
                    people, profoundly ignorant, and imbued with ideas and feelings which had been
                    transmitted from generation to generation for centuries, were irresponsive to
                    their appeals, terrified by their acts of violence, and prepared, from old
                    habit, to give themselves over into the hands of the priests again, as soon as
                    opportunity offered. In 1800, in a letter to Bonaparte, General Clarke writes:
                    »Our religious revolution has been a failure. France has become Roman Catholic
                    again. It would take thirty years' liberty of the press to destroy the spiritual
                    power of the Bishop of Rome.« He is mistaken only in his computation of thirty
                    years. Three hundred would be more nearly the number required, and even this
                    would only suffice if to liberty of the press were added good, free, and
                    entirely secular education.</p>

                <p><pb n="33"/> It was not the common people alone who had quietly remained faithful to the
                    church. In the upper-class families in the provinces the mother, with her
                    daughters, had generally remained Catholic, since the father, with the
                    Frenchman's natural caution and distrust of free thought, almost invariably,
                    whatever his private opinions might be, regarded religion as a beneficial
                    restraint upon women. The ladies had always embroidered altar-cloths, patronised
                    the priest, given him money for his poor parishioners, attended mass most
                    regularly. Now the celebration of mass was forbidden. The industrious and
                    phlegmatic French peasant, his wife, and his whole household had, until the
                    Revolution came, been accustomed to look up to <emph>Monsieur le curé</emph> as a species
                    of earthly providence, been accustomed to salute him reverently when he passed,
                    and to ask his advice; he had baptized the children, and from his hands they had
                    received their first sacrament; he had united Jacques to Fanchette in holy
                    matrimony; he had administered the last sacraments to the old mother. No one
                    read in the peasant's house; no one cultivated literature, or philosophy, or
                    music. Every impulse of the soul that rose above the plough-share and the clods
                    which it flung up took the direction of the church. Poor as it might be, it was
                    a festal hall in comparison with the cottar's hovel–and it was a holy place;
                    they knelt in it. Now the church was closed. Any one who has seen the peasants
                    of France or Italy pray, seen the touching devotion which shines from eyes as
                    earnest and as clear as a dog's, can understand what it meant to such people
                    that there was no longer to be mass or priest. And Sunday too! The peasant is
                    opposed to every change the utility of which is not at once apparent to him.
                    Sunday to be done away with! Had any one ever heard the like? Could such an idea
                    have occurred to any one except these gentlemen in Paris? Sunday, which had been
                    kept holy for more than a thousand years–possibly since the creation of the
                    world! God Himself had rested on the seventh day; but now the week was to have
                    ten days, and to be called <emph>Décade</emph>, a word which conveyed no meaning. Was God,
                    too, to be done away with?</p>

                <p><pb n="34"/> Add to all this the effect upon the younger and as yet undepraved priests.
                    Frayssinous, who, after the Restoration, became so famous as a Catholic
                    vindicator of Christianity, tells how he himself and a friend, also a priest,
                    continued to perform their sacred avocations during the Reign of Terror in spite
                    of all the threats of banishment, and how, in order to prove and strengthen
                    themselves, and familiarise themselves with the death which awaited them if they
                    were discovered, they went in turn to watch the executions on the permanent
                    scaffold of Rodez.</p>

                <p>Think of young enthusiasts such as these, or the priests described in Lamartine's
                    <emph>Jocelyn</emph>, meeting their flocks on Sunday mornings in underground caves, in
                    cold, damp cellars, which might well call to mind the catacombs of the early
                    Christians. The congregation talk of the trials of the church, comfort one
                    another, hear a sermon, receive the holy sacrament, and go their way with
                    tearful eyes and uplifted hearts. The great lady and the simple peasant woman
                    have felt that they are members of one body, as they never felt it when the one
                    occupied the best seat in church while the other sat on the bench at the
                    door.</p>

                <p>Even the confiscation of the property of the church turned out to be for the
                    church's good. Many a priest who had been demoralised by good living suddenly
                    found himself reduced to apostolic poverty. If deprivations only roused the
                    wrath of many, they chastened others. The cause for which a man suffers becomes
                    dear to him. The wavering, half-philosophic priest who (as we are told by
                    Barante) was almost ashamed to confess his belief in the doctrines of
                    Christianity, felt his self-esteem increase when the cause which he served was
                    persecuted. In 1801 Bishop Lecoz writes: »The religion which our Saviour founded
                    without the aid of wealth, He will maintain without its aid, which is unworthy
                    of His acceptance. When he called His twelve apostles, to what did He call them?
                    To the enjoyment of riches or of honour? No; to toil, to care, to suffering. If
                    then we, the servants of Jesus Christ, now find ourselves almost in this
                    apostolic condition, ought we to grumble? Nay, let us rather rejoice at this
                    precious deprivation of <pb n="35"/> the world's goods; let us thank the Lord, who has
                    restored things to that old condition for which the most pious of His children
                    have never ceased to long.«</p>

                <p>As the feeling of horror and shame produced by the Reign of Terror, when it was
                    past, turned the thoughts of many Frenchmen once more in the direction of
                    monarchy and the royal house, so the cruel persecution of religion awoke ardent
                    sympathy for the church and its priests.</p>

                <p>In Belgium (now incorporated with France), where there had been wholesale
                    banishment of the clergy, insurrections had broken out all over the country. To
                    quell them it had been necessary to burn numbers of villages and kill several
                    thousand peasants. In France there was now not only one Vendée; every province
                    had its own. In 1800 the royalist and church party had the upper hand almost
                    everywhere in the country communes of the twelve western departments; they had
                    40,000 men under arms. Even the men whose interests bound them most closely to
                    the new order of things, the men who had acquired the confiscated property of
                    the church, were not happy in their new possessions. The land of the new owner
                    had formerly belonged to the priest, the hospital, or the school. These had been
                    plundered, and he had become rich through their impoverishment. The women of his
                    household, his wife, his mother, were uneasy and often depressed, and when he
                    himself was ill he felt the stings of an evil conscience; he trusted that the
                    priest would grant him absolution at the last moment, but was tormented by the
                    fear that he might not. (Taine, <emph>Le régime moderne</emph>, i. 134, &amp;c.)</p>

                <p>All this was a good preparation for the rehabilitation of religion. And we must
                    not forget the intellectual force, the valuable ally, which the church gained by
                    suddenly, as it were, finding itself able to appropriate the fundamental
                    principle of the Revolution, and in its name win new supporters. The whole
                    situation was altered from the day when the church, hostile to liberty up to the
                    last possible moment, finally, vanquished by necessity, inscribed liberty on its
                    banner. Oppressed, and feeling the need of liberty for itself, it now spoke in
                    the name of liberty, and that so <pb n="36"/> touchingly that all who heard the crocodile
                    weep took it to be a defenceless creature. Liberal Catholicism–how the words
                    jar!–came into being. The church wrested the best weapon of the Revolution out
                    of its hands, and put it into those of her own adherents–only temporarily, of
                    course, until she had reconquered her old power; then, alas for liberty! But in
                    the meantime the Pope had suddenly become <emph>liberal</emph>–religious liberalism, they
                    called it. When the order of the Jesuits was reconstructed, even the Jesuits
                    declared that their desire was »good, true liberty.«</p>

                <p>How much honesty there was in this appeal to liberty was seen as soon as religion
                    was in power again. When, in 1808, Napoleon demanded of the Pope that he should
                    concede liberty of religion, the Pope replied: »Because such liberty is at
                    variance with the law of the church, with the decrees of its councils, and with
                    the Catholic religion, because, moreover, by reason of the terrible consequences
                    it would entail, it is incompatible with the peace and happiness of nations, we
                    have condemned it.« Simple-minded Catholics, like Lamennais, who at a somewhat
                    later period acted on the supposition that all this talk of liberty was intended
                    to be taken literally, discovered how much it meant. But even after Lamennais
                    had been disposed of by a papal bull in 1832, his disciple Montalembert, who
                    renounced his master's theories and became the most vigorous champion of the
                    church in the middle of this century, was permitted to go on preaching <emph>liberal</emph>
                    Catholicism. It was not until 1873, when such Catholicism could no longer be
                    turned to any possible use, that it was anathematised in one of the most
                    virulent bulls on record. Only few of those who read the bull in the newspapers
                    understood its full import.</p>

                <p>The appeals in the name of liberty gained the church many supporters; and to the
                    men of principle who, at the moment of the revulsion under the Consulate, were
                    influenced by these appeals, and whose sympathy for the church was increased by
                    the harsh treatment meted out to the Pope under the Empire, there were added on
                    the restoration of the Bourbons the many whose religion is <pb n="37"/> always that of their
                    masters, all the approvers of Holberg's fox' moral: »Give no thought to
                    religious matters; abide blindly by the prevailing belief!«</p>

                <p>About the year 1800, however, though an occasional revolutionary excess was still
                    not unheard of, France enjoyed complete religious liberty, guaranteed by law. To
                    the persecution of priests under the Convention and the imperfect tolerance of
                    the Directory had succeeded perfect legal security for all confessions; the
                    priests had been relieved from the obnoxious oath, its place being taken by a
                    simple promise to obey the law; and each priest was now supported by the
                    voluntary contributions of his parishioners, the state abstaining from all
                    interference. These contributions were naturally often small, and many a prelate
                    looked back with longing to the flesh-pots of the old days, and to what
                    Robespierre called the alliance between the sceptre and the censer. Bonaparte
                    had the choice between fostering the germ of religious liberty and making a tool
                    of religious tradition. He did not deliberate. The re-establishment of the
                    church was an indispensable link in the chain of his policy.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Laurent, <emph>Histoire du droit des gens</emph>, tome xiv.; Carlyle, <emph>History of the

                <p>One night in the month of October 1801 the gates of Paris were secretly opened to
                    admit a closed carriage with a military escort. What was concealed in that
                    carnage? Was it a criminal? Was it contraband ware? There sat in it an old
                    priest, Caprara by name, the Pope's envoy to General Bonaparte; and the
                    contraband article thus smuggled into Paris in the darkness was the Concordat,
                    the compact with Rome which re-established the Christian religion in France. It
                    was considered rash to allow a priest coming on such an errand to make his
                    entrance in daylight; the First Consul, with his usual sagacity and forethought,
                    had arranged that he should arrive at night. It was not violence that was
                    feared, only laughter. »They dared not,« says Thiers, »put such temptation in
                    the way of the mirth-loving population of Paris.«<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Thiers, <emph>Histoire du consulat et de l'empire</emph>, iii. 211, 342.</note></p>

                <p>The same difficulty recurred in April 1802, when, after countless attempts to
                    come to an agreement, during the course of which it often seemed as if the
                    negotiations were on the point of being finally broken off, things were so far
                    settled that Napoleon could accord an official reception to the Cardinal-Legate.
                    Ecclesiastical etiquette prescribes that a gold crucifix shall be borne in front
                    of a papal legate, and the Cardinal demanded that on his way to the reception at
                    the Tuileries this should be done by a mounted officer in a red uniform. On this
                    occasion also the Government, as Thiers tells us, was afraid of the effect of
                    such a spectacle on the population of Paris. A compromise was come to; it was
                    agreed to do with the crucifix what had been done with <pb n="39"/> the Cardinal himself six
                    months previously, namely, drive it in a closed carriage.</p>

                <p>At last, a week later, on Easter Sunday, April 18, 1802 (28th Germinal of the
                    year X.), a copy of the Concordat was posted up early in the morning in all the
                    streets of Paris, and the First Consul, after signing the Peace of Amiens in
                    honour of the day, proceeded to Notre Dame, to hear the great Te Deum sung in
                    celebration of the reinstitution of Christian worship, or, to use the official
                    expression, the reconciliation of the Republic with Heaven. Programmes of the
                    ceremonies had been distributed. The First Consul was attended by a numerous and
                    distinguished suite. He had himself intimated to the wives of all the high
                    officials that they were expected to appear in full dress. They accompanied
                    Madame Bonaparte; he himself was surrounded by his staff, all his generals, and
                    all the most important civil functionaries. The carriages which had belonged to
                    the old court were taken into use again on this occasion. Bonaparte drove to
                    church in the old royal state-coach, and with all the pomp of royalty. Salvoes
                    of artillery proclaimed to the world this resurrection of the church from the
                    dead and this first attempt at the revival of royal power and royal splendour.
                    The route of the procession from the Tuileries to Notre Dame was lined by troops
                    of the First Army Corps. The Archbishop of Paris received the First Consul at
                    the church door and offered him holy water. He was then conducted under a canopy
                    to the seat reserved for him. The Senate, the Legislative Assembly, and the
                    Tribune occupied the places at the two sides of the altar. The church was soon
                    full of uniforms, beautiful dresses, and liveries. Liveries, which had
                    disappeared during the Revolution, reappeared along with cassocks. Behind the
                    First Consul stood his generals, in gala uniform, »rather obedient than
                    convinced,« as Thiers remarks. They did their best to show what was really the
                    case, namely, that they were there against their will, and that the whole
                    ceremony was in their eyes a contemptible farce. Their behaviour was
                    characterised by those who differed from them as »unseemly.« That of the First <pb n="40"/> Consul presented a marked contrast. Attired in his red consul's uniform, he
                    stood motionless, with a severe, inscrutable countenance, serious and cold,
                    displaying neither the indifference of the unwilling spectators nor the devotion
                    of the faithful. On the hilt of his sword glittered the famous Regent diamond,
                    which he had had set there for the occasion, as a sign that the symbols of
                    majesty which had hitherto belonged to the crown now belonged to the sword. His
                    demeanour showed plainly enough that this act of his was not an act of faith,
                    but of will, and that he was determined his will should prevail.</p>

                <p>On the morning of the day on which this famous Te Deum was sung, the Government
                    organ, <emph>Le Moniteur</emph>, published by Bonaparte's express order a review of a book,
                    the second edition of which was dedicated to him as the restorer of the church.
                    The book was Chateaubriand's <emph>Génie du Christianisme</emph>. The review was written by
                    Fontanes; it had appeared in the <emph>Mercure</emph> three days before, but was now, by
                    Government orders, republished in the official organ. <emph>Le Génie du
                    Christianisme</emph> was as much part of the programme of the day as the low-necked
                    dresses and the liveries. The religious reaction in society and in literature
                    may be dated almost from the same hour, from the same fête. In a letter from
                    Joubert to Chateaubriand's friend, Madame de Beaumont, we come upon the
                    remarkable words: »Our friend was created and brought into the world expressly
                    for this occasion.«</p>

                <p>The planning and compassing of this same religious solemnity had cost Bonaparte
                    an infinite amount of trouble. But of what avail was it that at every street
                    corner men read that »the example of centuries, as well as reason, bade them
                    appeal to the papal sovereign to reconcile opinions and customs«? Of what avail
                    that the city was illuminated and a state concert given at the Tuileries in
                    honour of the solemn occasion? The feeling inspired was dissatisfaction, a
                    dissatisfaction as great as the joy inspired in its day by the festival in
                    honour of the Supreme Being.</p>

                <p>When Bonaparte, on his return from Notre Dame, turned in the Tuileries to one of
                    his officers, General <pb n="41"/> Delmas, and asked his opinion of the grand religious
                    ceremony, that officer replied: »It was an excellent Capuchin carnival play
                    (<emph>Capucinade</emph>); there was only one thing wanting–the million of people who have
                    given their lives to break down what you are building up again.« And in these
                    words Delmas expressed the general feeling of Napoleon's officers. In November
                    1801 the exasperation of the army at the idea of a reconciliation with the
                    church had made itself distinctly felt; men who were on such intimate terms with
                    Bonaparte as Lannes and Augereau had plainly expressed their annoyance at the
                    prospect of having to show their uniforms in a church; and it was a common
                    remark among the soldiers that the French flags had never won so many laurels as
                    now, when they were no longer consecrated. When the generals received a direct
                    order to appear at Notre Dame they sent Augereau (in vain, we know) as their
                    spokesman to the Tuileries to implore that they might be excused.</p>

                <p>The army was the element in society which had remained most faithful to the
                    fundamental ideas of the Revolution. When, under the Directory, the royalist
                    reaction seemed on the point of victory, it was foiled because the Republican
                    Government, weak and divided as it was, could rely upon the army. For in the
                    army the true republican principle of equality had been maintained as it had
                    been nowhere else. Before the Revolution, officer and private had been separated
                    by a yawning chasm. The officer was originally the feudal lord, then the
                    landowner, then the nobleman; and no private soldier, however greatly he
                    distinguished himself, could make his way up into this higher caste. During the
                    Revolution these relations had been turned upside down. In the first place there
                    were, amongst the crowds who volunteered as private soldiers, many men of noble
                    birth; and in the second place, the nobility had been deprived of their right to
                    officer the army; the officers were chosen from the ranks. Moreover, the
                    fatigues and hardships shared alike by all during the wars of the Republic had
                    made officers and privates comrades. In spite of regimental discipline, the <pb n="42"/> private soldier felt himself to be the brother-in-arms of his officer, whose
                    equal he might any day become by his bravery and the fortunes of war.</p>

                <p>A return to monarchical government would have been at once fatal to this new
                    constitution of the army; and every mark of favour shown to the church was
                    regarded as a presage or preliminary of such a return. Hence the army still
                    spoke the old revolutionary language–was equally hostile to kings, nobles, and
                    priests. It lived in apprehension of a restoration of the monarchy and of
                    Catholicism, trusted in Bonaparte as the man who was to prevent this, and was
                    prepared, in case of his defection, to appeal to another Jacobin
                    general–Jourdan, Bernadotte, or Augereau–to arrange a counter <emph>coup
                    d'état</emph>.</p>

                <p>So bitter was the feeling in the army against the Catholic priesthood at the
                    moment when the Concordat was signed, that secret meetings were held and a
                    conspiracy was organised to annul this com<pb n="43"/>pact with the church. Many officers of
                    rank, even distinguished generals, were mixed up in the affair. Moreau was in
                    communication with the conspirators, although he never attended their meetings.
                    At one of these meetings they went the length of resolving on the assassination
                    of the First Consul. A certain Donnadieu offered to do the deed. But General
                    Oudinot, who was present, informed Davoust of what was impending, and Donnadieu,
                    who was arrested, confessed everything. The conspirators were dispersed; some
                    were imprisoned, some banished, among the latter being General Monnier, who had
                    commanded one of Desaix's brigades at Marengo.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">L. von Stein, <emph>Geschichte der socialen Bewegung in Frankreich</emph>, i. 230.</note></p>

                <p>All this gives us a sufficiently clear idea of the state of opinion in the army.
                    And the civil authorities were of the same mind. The plan of the Concordat had
                    met with unanimous opposition. Talleyrand, as Minister of Foreign Affairs, had
                    persistently advised against it. The Concordat struck at himself, as a former
                    bishop, and with his political clearsightedness he foresaw its serious
                    consequences for France. The Council of State received the First Consul's
                    announcement that he had signed the compact with cold silence, and yet it was in
                    this assembly that he had his most devoted adherents. Even Thiers, whose
                    admiration for Bonaparte leads him to give an incomplete account of the episode
                    of the Concordat, writes: »The members sat gloomy and dumb, as if they had seen
                    one of the most beneficial achievements of the Revolution undone before their
                    eyes. The icy silence was not broken. They dispersed without expressing an
                    opinion, without saying a word.«</p>

                <p>The announcement met with even a worse reception in the Legislative Assembly.
                    That body entered its protest against the re-establishment of the church by
                    electing as its president Dupuis, the author of <emph>Origine des cultes</emph>, a book
                    then much in repute, which explains Christianity as an astronomical myth (the
                    work parodied in Monod's famous pamphlet on Napoleon as a sun-myth). Bonaparte,
                    although he already felt himself possessed of almost unlimited power, dared not
                    lay the Concordat alone before the Legislative Assembly; along with it he
                    submitted to their approval the so-called Organic Laws, which aimed at
                    establishing the relative independence of the French church. Knowing that they
                    feared papal influence, he hoped by this means to secure their votes. But it was
                    not until all its most energetic members had been expelled that the Assembly
                    sanctioned the Concordat.</p>

                <p>In the Tribune there was a regular revolt, and nothing less than a new breach of
                    the constitution, namely, the reduction of the number of members of that Chamber
                    to eighty, was required to overcome its opposition. To only three classes of men
                    did the Concordat immediately give entire satisfaction. These were (1) the
                    clergy, with the exception of those who had sworn allegiance to the Republican
                    constitution and who were now dismissed; (2) the numerous possessors of church
                    property, who had hitherto felt themselves insecure, but were now confirmed in
                    their ownership; (3) the great, ignorant peasant class, who could neither read
                    nor write, and who longed for their Sunday and their church pageantry.</p>

                <p>Even in the circle of the First Consul's most intimate <pb n="44"/> associates one attempt
                    after another had been made to shake his resolve. The spirit of the eighteenth
                    century was strong in the men whose great or rare gifts made them the most
                    eminent of the day, and it was these men whom Bonaparte chose for his
                    companions. They all belonged to the class of »moderate Revolutionists,« and
                    were all disciples of Voltaire. Men like the famous astronomer Laplace, like the
                    mathematicians Lagrange and Monge, told Bonaparte every day that he was on the
                    point of bringing disgrace on his reign and his century. His old
                    companions-in-arms, says Thiers, though they knew how the nation honoured them,
                    dreaded the ridicule which awaited them if they knelt before the altar. Even his
                    own brothers, who associated with the most talented writers of the day,
                    importuned him not to stake his enormous power on a step so utterly at variance
                    with the spirit of the times.</p>

                <p>These strong expressions, like the previously quoted words of Madame Roland, show
                    how certain men were that Christianity was to be regarded as dead.</p>

                <p>It was not religious conviction which induced a man with a mind like Bonaparte's
                    to act, regardless of all considerations and representations, in opposition to
                    the whole of thinking France. Many of his utterances prove that he himself
                    shared the opinions of the men he was opposing, that he did homage to the
                    so-called enlightened deism of the eighteenth century. Certain assertions made
                    by Bonaparte to Monge have been quoted to prove that he was an orthodox
                    believer. »My religion is a very simple one,« he said. »I see this great,
                    complex, magnificent universe, and say to myself that it cannot have been
                    produced by chance, but must be the work of an unknown, almighty being, who is
                    as superior to man as the universe is to our cleverest machines.« But would not
                    Voltaire have expressed himself exactly thus? Bonaparte continued: »But this
                    truth is too concise, too brief, for man; he wants to know many secrets about
                    himself and his future which the universe does not tell him. Here religion steps
                    in, and tells each individual what he longs to know. The one religion
                    undoubtedly denies what the other asserts. But I do not, like <pb n="45"/> Volney, conclude
                    from this that all religions are worthless, but rather that they are all good.«
                    This is the language of Lessing's Nathan. And quite in keeping with it is
                    another assertion made to Monge: »In Egypt I was a Mahometan; I must be a
                    Catholic in France. I do not believe in religions, but in the idea of a
                    God.«</p>

                <p>Some years earlier, in a speech made before the Directory and all the public
                    officials (December 1797), he had reckoned attachment to religion, along with
                    attachment to monarchy and feudalism, among »the prejudices which the French
                    people must overcome.« When in Egypt, he had not scrupled to proclaim himself a
                    Mussulman. His proclamation to the Arabian population contains this clause: »We,
                    too, are good Mussulmans. Is it not we that have destroyed the power of the
                    Pope, who commanded war upon Mussulmans?« Now he certainly (officially) called
                    the same Pope »the holy Father« and (privately) »the good lamb«; nevertheless,
                    when negotiations were being hindered by Romish intrigues, he wrote of him in
                    his letters as »the old fox,« and called the priests, or, to use his own word,
                    <emph>la prêtraille</emph>, »imbecile bunglers.«</p>

                <p>His behaviour during these same negotiations with Rome witnesses equally strongly
                    to his political wiliness and his unorthodoxy. Cardinal Consalvi, before setting
                    out on his journey to Paris in 1801, had been imprudent enough to write to a
                    friend of the anxiety he felt in thus venturing into the very jaws of the lion,
                    into the hot-bed of that Revolution which had very recently shown itself so
                    terribly hostile to religion and its priests. Bonaparte owned a sort of Odin's
                    raven, which repeated all such private confessions to him. This raven was at the
                    post office where the Cardinal's letter was opened, and its master consequently
                    prepared just such a reception as was likely to make an impression on the man to
                    whose character the letter gave a clue. It was evening when Consalvi arrived in
                    Paris, but his audience was already appointed for the next morning, so that he
                    had neither time to recover from the fatigues of the journey nor to take counsel
                    with the Pope's representatives. Early in the morning he was driven to the
                    Tuileries and ushered into <pb n="46"/> a small bare room which he took to be the anteroom of
                    the First Consul's audience chamber. After he had waited here for some time, a
                    small door was opened, and through it he passed, to his surprise, into a long
                    suite of splendid apartments, where all the principal government officials, the
                    Senate, the Legislative Assembly, the generals, and the staff were assembled. In
                    the courtyard he could see several regiments drawn up for inspection. It was, as
                    he himself wrote, the sudden transition from a hut to a palace. All the dazzling
                    splendour and formidable signs of authority by which the consular dignity could
                    be enhanced were here exhibited, and when, in the farthest room of the suite,
                    the Cardinal at last entered the presence of the three Consuls, who sat
                    surrounded by a splendid retinue, Bonaparte advanced to meet him and said
                    curtly, in an imperious voice: »I know why you have come. You have five days for
                    negotiation. If the treaty is not signed by that time, everything is at an end.«
                    Consalvi was undoubtedly perturbed for the moment, but he succeeded in gaining
                    time, and with the subtlety and skill of Romish statecraft placed so many
                    difficulties in Napoleon's way that the latter, in one of the stormy audiences
                    which followed, shouted angrily and arrogantly: »If Henry VIII., who had not the
                    twentieth part of my power, could change the religion of his country, how much
                    easier is it for me to do it! I will change it, not in France alone, but
                    throughout Europe. Rome will weep blood when it is too late.«</p>

                <p>In this contemptuous manner did the restorer of religion speak of the power he
                    intended to restore.</p>

                <p>It is, therefore, not altogether surprising that, as in the case of a similar
                    attempt made by Julian the Apostate 1500 years before, laughter, sometimes only
                    dreaded, sometimes actual, was the inseparable adjunct of each step taken
                    towards the reinstitution of the old religion. When Bonaparte read Pius VII.'s
                    first brief at a Council of State, the brief in which the Pope intimates that he
                    takes »his dear son Talleyrand« into favour again, sounds of half-stifled
                    laughter were heard among the audience. Even Bonaparte himself was not always
                    able to preserve his <pb n="47"/> gravity. On the day when Cardinal Consalvi, apparelled in
                    Roman purple, publicly presented him with a copy of the Concordat, the First
                    Consul was suddenly seized with a convulsive fit of laughter which struck the
                    whole assembly with consternation. And some years later than this he was still
                    so little edified by religious rites, and so unable to control his countenance
                    during their performance–he who as a rule showed himself a master in the
                    art–that when the Pope was anointing him Emperor in 1804 he scandalised the
                    spectators by yawning incessantly during the whole ceremony. Charles X., true
                    Bourbon as he was, showed the proper seriousness when his turn came in 1825.
                    With unmoved countenance, without the shadow of a smile, he allowed himself to
                    be stripped to the waist and anointed, first on the head, then on breast, back,
                    and arms.</p>

                <p>Everything connected with the restoration of priestly authority and the
                    reinstitution of Catholic worship was so utterly at variance with the customs
                    and ideas which had prevailed in France since the Revolution that the witnesses
                    of such rites could hardly believe their own eyes; they could not persuade
                    themselves to take them seriously. In proof of this let me quote the words of
                    such an eye-witness, De Pradt, Archbishop of Malines. He says: »If one single
                    individual, by laughing, had given the signal, there would have been a perfectly
                    inextinguishable Homeric outburst. This was the reef on which it was possible
                    that everything might be wrecked. Fortunately Fouché, the Chief of Police, had
                    taken the proper precautions, and, thanks to him, Paris kept a serious
                    face.«<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">De Pradt, <emph>Histoire des quatre concordats</emph>, ii. 212.</note></p>

                <p>The occasion to which this utterance more particularly refers was that of the
                    Pope's visit to Paris. A Pope in Paris! This was a risky experiment after all
                    that had happened there during the last fifteen years, and with »a population so
                    light-hearted and still so strongly influenced by philosophy.« In hopes of
                    inducing the Pope to give up the journey, his advisers at the last moment laid
                    the above quoted Egyptian proclamation upon his table. But it was too late to
                    shake his resolve. The meeting of the two <pb n="48"/> potentates took place at
                    Fontainebleau. After the first exchange of compliments and cordialities, they
                    drove to the Palace in the same carriage. Napoleon's face beamed with
                    satisfaction, and as he handed the Pope up the steps, each of his unusually
                    lively glances seemed to say: »Do you see my prize? I have him.« By a comical
                    inadvertency, the great procession to Paris was led by a troop of mounted
                    Mamelukes. The sight of the bronze-hued visages of these Mahometan horsemen
                    transported the spectator in fancy to Mecca. They made the entrance seem more
                    like that of a Mahometan than of a Christian high priest. The Pope's own face
                    betrayed the embarrassment he felt on finding himself in such an entirely new
                    world. It was easily seen that his foot, though it was kissed by multitudes, did
                    not tread this soil with perfect confidence. His priestly retinue, resplendent
                    in gorgeous episcopal vestments, and the military court which came to meet it,
                    shining in burnished mail, presented a strange contrast. One might, says
                    Archbishop de Pradt, have imagined one's self suddenly transported to Japan at
                    the moment of a visit from its spiritual to its temporal emperor.</p>

                <p>In order thoroughly to understand the First Consul's reasons for determinedly
                    adhering to and carrying out a project which at the first glance seems
                    unpatriotic and impolitic, we must consider the matter in the first place from
                    the purely economic point of view.</p>

                <p>The Revolution had plunged France into economic distress. Prosperity was at an
                    end; the population was threatened by famine; in the middle of the nineties more
                    than half of the country lay uncultivated. The lands of the <emph>émigrés</emph> and the
                    church had been paid for by their purchasers in paper-money, but this
                    paper-money was valueless. The economic salvation of the country could only be
                    accomplished by turning to account the resources which had been made available
                    by the new distribution of the state property.</p>

                <p>The land which had been taken from the nobility and the church had long been left
                    entirely uncultivated because, since the fruits of the earth require time to
                    blossom and mature, <pb n="49"/> no one was willing to plough and sow without the certainty
                    that the ground would remain in his possession long enough to reward him for his
                    labour. But such certainty was impossible as long as the old owners of the land
                    were in the country and had not renounced their right to it. Nothing but their
                    extermination could make the cultivation of the new national property a
                    reasonable proceeding. It was because the Reign of Terror exterminated them that
                    it was demanded and endured. When it had fulfilled its double task of saving the
                    Republic and ensuring the security of the new distribution of property, it was
                    overthrown. What the owners of property demanded after its fall was, first and
                    foremost, a government under which it was possible for them to utilise their
                    newly acquired land.</p>

                <p>There were in France still only the elements of a modern social organism, of new
                    conditions of proprietorship, of a new code of laws–everything was incomplete.
                    The Estates had disappeared; classes did not as yet exist. The new order of
                    things had not yet become, as it were, a part of the family and the individual
                    ethical consciousness. Security, durability, was what now had to be
                    achieved.</p>

                <p>This could not be done by restoring the monarchy; for at this period monarchy
                    still meant the old order of things, the old laws, the old distribution of
                    property. Bonaparte gave France the security she desired. And he did more than
                    this; by his victories he spread the new French ideas and customs abroad
                    throughout Europe.</p>

                <p>The weak point in the international position of France at the beginning of the
                    century lay in the antagonism between its new social order and the old social
                    order prevailing in all the other countries. For the sake of its own security it
                    was necessary that the French nation should metamorphose the social institutions
                    of the nations it overcame. Bonaparte understood this, and introduced the new
                    order of things wherever his influence permitted him to do so.</p>

                <p>But, on the other hand, he considered it necessary to make concessions, real or
                    apparent, in those matters in which he could not otherwise bring about
                    uniformity between French conditions and those of the rest of Europe. To ensure <pb n="50"/> the stability of the new order of things, he felt obliged to do what he himself
                    called <emph>mettre les institutions de la France en harmonie avec celles de
                    l'Europe</emph>. He imagined that the imperial crown upon his head would reconcile the
                    powers to the French Revolution; he believed that the creation of a nobility
                    would promote a more harmonious feeling between foreign nations and his own; and
                    in the same manner he considered it good policy to give France back a state
                    church bearing some resemblance to the churches of other countries.</p>

                <p>He began at the foundation, that is to say, with the church. The Concordat was
                    concluded in 1802. In the same year was founded the order of the Legion of
                    Honour, which satisfactorily answered its purpose as a mark of military
                    distinction, but failed in what it was really intended to accomplish, the
                    creation of an aristocracy. In 1804 the Empire was created. In 1807 the law of
                    entail was reintroduced. In 1808 an entirely new aristocracy was created.</p>

                <p>All this, however, did not produce real similarity between France and the rest of
                    Europe. There was little resemblance between Napoleon, the elected emperor, and
                    the kings and emperors of the old dynasties; and Napoleon's aristocracy was an
                    aristocracy without privileges, his church a church without endowments. But,
                    although his various attempts at restoration resulted in the estrangement of
                    many of the best elements in French society, it cannot be denied that they
                    evidenced political sagacity in both internal and international questions.</p>

                <p>There was sound political economy in the idea of the Concordat.</p>

                <p>It had not as yet been possible to efface the species of disgrace which attached
                    to the ownership of the confiscated property of the church and the nobles.
                    Consequently it did not yet possess the same market value as other property. An
                    inherited estate and an estate belonging to the nation yielding the same revenue
                    did not find purchasers at the same price; the latter had to be sold for forty
                    per cent. less. The state could only alter this condition of matters in one <pb n="51"/> way,
                    namely, by inducing the former possessors of what was now state property to make
                    a distinct renunciation of their right to it. In most cases this could not be
                    accomplished. As regarded church property, however, it was possible; for the
                    church had a head, whose decisions were binding on all his subjects.</p>

                <p>By means of the Concordat with the Pope Bonaparte succeeded in giving the
                    purchasers of church property that security which they had so long desired in
                    vain. The Pope declared distinctly that neither he nor his successors would ever
                    lay claim to the church lands which had been sold. So now there was no longer
                    either risk or sin in owning them. In return the state promised the church a
                    fixed income. The clergy of all ranks were to receive remuneration–a
                    comparatively modest yearly payment in money and a dwelling-house. The churches
                    which had not been sold were made over to them. As regarded the expenses
                    entailed by the maintenance of public worship, the clergy were referred to their
                    Commune or Department (which was entitled to levy a tax for this purpose) and to
                    the charity of the faithful. Agreements of the same kind were come to in the
                    matter of the church educational and charitable institutions. The state had
                    deprived the Catholic church of at least 5000 millions of capital and 270
                    millions of revenue; in return it promised a yearly revenue of seventeen
                    millions–thus doing a good stroke of business at the same time that it
                    tranquillised both the owners of church property and the great body of orthodox
                    Catholics.</p>

                <p>The Concordat placed the three chief Christian confessions and the Jewish
                    religion in the same position; they were all under state protection and their
                    clergy were all dependent on the state for their incomes. Napoleon evidently
                    overestimated the power which this gave him over the Catholic church, the only
                    one of any importance in France. It soon opposed him, upon which he used
                    violence, actually carrying off the Pope and keeping him prisoner. He himself
                    set his Concordat at naught.</p>

                <p>But its sound political and tactical basis enabled it to survive both this breach
                    and its projector's fall.</p>

                <p><pb n="52"/> The very important part which Bonaparte's personal ambition must have played in
                    the evolution of the Concordat need only be suggested. With the authority of the
                    church had been overthrown the authority of the monarchy. What was required was
                    the restoration of the principle of authority. All the ceremonial of the old
                    monarchy returned of its own accord at the moment when religion again became a
                    power in the state. The revivification of the idea of authority which the
                    Revolution misunderstood and scorned has been described as Napoleon's greatest
                    and most arduous achievement.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">See Guizot in the <emph>Revue des deux mondes</emph>, February 15, 1863.</note> It has been said with truth that no one ever
                    developed the instinct and the gift of ruling as naturally and as boldly as he.
                    But from the moment when, no longer content with being a power in virtue of his
                    genius and of the new social order, he attempted to restore autocratic monarchy,
                    what he relied on was not that idea of authority which amalgamates with the idea
                    of right, and is an expression of the reasonableness of things, but the idea of
                    authority which influences by dazzling and which is accepted blindly. And from
                    that moment the alliance with the church was a necessity. When, in 1808, Wieland
                    asked the Emperor why he had not adapted the religion he had reintroduced
                    somewhat more to the spirit of the times, Napoleon laughed and replied: »Yes, my
                    dear Wieland! It is certainly not a religion intended for philosophers. The
                    philosophers believe neither in me nor my religion; and for the people who do
                    believe one cannot do miracles enough or allow them to retain too many.« It
                    would hardly be possible to assert more plainly that authority is a dazzling,
                    deluding power. On other occasions Napoleon employed the word which became the
                    intellectual catchword of the following period–he described religion as
                    <emph>order</emph>. Johannes Müller writes to his brother in 1806: »The Emperor spoke of
                    what lay at the foundation of all religions, and of their necessity, and said
                    that men required to be kept in order.«</p>

                <p>In this conception of religion as order we seem to trace some resemblance between
                    Napoleon and the Jaco<pb n="53"/>bins, just as there is certainly a similarity between his
                    attempts to rehabilitate the church and Robespierre's endeavours to reanimate
                    religious feeling. As a politician Robespierre believed in the ordering,
                    regulating power of religion, and as a politician at a period when the great
                    majority of educated men were deists, he feared atheism as an idea altogether
                    foreign to his age.</p>

                <p>Bonaparte perceived what an invaluable instrument in the hand of a ruler a
                    traditional religion and form of public worship was, and, if for no other reason
                    than this, was determined on an alliance with the clergy, whom he, when a victor
                    in Italy, had flattered and favoured with a view to eventualities. He was well
                    aware that in France as in other countries the ignorant majority were still
                    attached to the traditional religion, and that the teachings of the
                    eighteenth-century philosophers could not possibly as yet have penetrated to the
                    lowest and widest layer of the population. At an earlier period he had openly
                    avowed his aims. At a meeting of his Council of State in the year 1800 he
                    exclaimed: »With my government functionaries, my armed police, and my priests I
                    am in a position to do whatever I please.« To him the priest was a police
                    official like the others, simply with a different uniform. In the notes which he
                    dictated to Montholon he plainly intimates that the Concordat originated in his
                    wish to attach the clergy to the new order of things, and to break the last tie
                    which bound them, and the country with them, to the old royal house. He had
                    carefully weighed in his own mind the choice which lay open to him between
                    Catholicism and Protestantism. He conceded to his advisers that the inclination
                    of the moment was probably more in the direction of Protestantism. »But,« he
                    sagaciously queried, »is Protestantism the old religion of France? Is it
                    possible to create in a people habits, tastes, memories? The principal charm of
                    a religion lies in its memories. When I am at Malmaison I never hear the church
                    bell of the neighbouring village ring without feeling moved. And in France who
                    could feel moved in a Protestant church, <pb n="54"/> which evokes no memories of childhood,
                    and the cold, severe appearance of which is so little in harmony with the ideas
                    of the people?« »Besides,« said he to Las Casas, »all my great aims were to be
                    attained much more certainly with the aid of Catholicism. It kept the Pope on my
                    side, and with my influence in Italy and my military strength there I did not
                    doubt that sooner or later, by one means or another, I should get this same Pope
                    into my power. And from that moment what influence! what a lever with which to
                    move public opinion throughout the world!... Had I returned from Moscow as a
                    conqueror I should easily have induced the Pope to forget the loss of his
                    temporal power. I should have made him an idol; he would have stayed with me.
                    Paris would then have become the metropolis of the Christian world, and I should
                    have ruled the religious as well as the political world.... <emph>My</emph> church councils
                    would then have represented Christianity; the Popes would simply have been their
                    presidents.«</p>

                <p>Note, too, the arguments employed by Portalis, the official vindicator and
                    champion of the Concordat. Attempting to prove the impossibility of introducing
                    a new religion and the necessity of restoring the old one, he writes: »In
                    ancient times, in the days of ignorance and barbarism, it was possible for very
                    great men to proclaim themselves inspired by God, and, following the example of
                    Prometheus, to bring down fire from heaven to animate a new world. But what is
                    possible among a people still in the process of development is not possible in
                    an old, time-worn nation, whose habits and thoughts it is so difficult to
                    change.« He begins, we see, by appealing to the authority of custom. And he
                    continues: »Men believe in a religion only because they take it to be the work
                    of a God. All is lost as soon as the hand of man is allowed to appear.« It is
                    unnecessary to argue that this language is not the language of faith. What
                    Portalis refers to are the unsuccessful attempts to supersede the so-called
                    revealed religion by a revolutionary religion, a »religion of reason,« like
                    Rousseau's and Robespierre's. These attempts had failed although the new
                    religion did not <pb n="55"/> need to be invented, but in reality already lived in the minds
                    of the educated classes–had failed because it was impossible, directly after
                    the overthrow of all outward authority, to give to the conviction shared by the
                    majority of the educated an outward authority of the nature of that which had
                    been overthrown. They bore no fruit, because their originators failed to grasp
                    the fact that the human mind is perpetually remoulding its religious and moral
                    conceptions, because they did not understand that the emancipated mind must
                    inevitably feel itself moving onward even faster than before its emancipation
                    towards a more perfect apprehension, and must consequently feel itself compelled
                    ever and anew to reject every limiting, dogmatic principle. But to return,
                    because the spontaneously evolved and chosen form of belief had proved
                    untenable, to the much more untenable, old, petrified form, was certainly better
                    politics than logic. There was no argument possible except an appeal to the
                    direct utility of the proceeding. Therefore Portalis returns again and yet again
                    to the position, not that religion is true, but that it is useful, that it is
                    necessary, that it is impossible to rule without it, that morality without
                    religious dogmas would be »like justice without courts for its administration.«
                    It is plain that the doctrine of hell-fire, as long as it is believed in, is a
                    powerful instrument in the hand of a ruler. Portalis is actually honest enough
                    to say in plain words: »The question of the truth or falsehood of this or that
                    positive religion is a purely theological question, which does not concern us.
                    Even if they are false, religions have this advantage, that they are a hindrance
                    to the spread of arbitrary, independent teaching. They form a faith-focus for
                    individuals. Governments are at ease with regard to ascertained dogmas which do
                    not change. Superstition is, so to speak, regulated, circumscribed, confined
                    within bounds which it either cannot or dare not overstep.«</p>

                <p>With subtle duplicity Bonaparte endeavoured to represent the restoration of the
                    church in a different light to the different parties. To the Catholics it was
                    represented as a service to Christianity only paralleled by the deeds of
                    Con<pb n="56"/>stantine and Charlemagne, to the philosophers as an act by which the church
                    was completely subjected to the state and the secular authorities. »It is an
                    inoculation against religion,« said Napoleon to the philosopher Cabanis; »in
                    fifty years there will be no religion left in France.« So much is certain, that
                    he had no doubt whatever that by bringing about this reconciliation between
                    church and state he was ensuring himself an obedient and devoted ally. To what
                    extent he was mistaken is matter of history. He had soon cause to repent
                    bitterly of having allied himself with the most undeveloped and ignorant,
                    instead of the ablest and best, part of the nation. De Pradt tells that he heard
                    Napoleon say again and again »that the Concordat was the greatest mistake of his
                    reign.« It can hardly be called a political mistake. But it certainly was the
                    first and decisive departure from the spirit of the Revolution. It ensured
                    certain of the secular results of that Revolution, but ensured them at the
                    expense of the progress of French civilisation.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Sources: Thiers, <emph>Histoire du Consulat</emph>; Lanfrey, <emph>Histoire de Napoléon I</emph>.;

                <head><pb n="[57]"/> III. THE PRINCIPLE OF AUTHORITY</head>

                <p>Bonaparte, intending as he did to deal the Republic a death-blow, struck at its
                    heart. He recognised that it would never be possible thoroughly to suppress
                    civil liberty unless he first suppressed the endeavour after spiritual liberty
                    which had become ever more strenuous during the course of the Revolution. The
                    Concordat prepared the way for the recovery by ecclesiasticism of all its old
                    power.</p>

                <p>It appeared to contemporaries as if all the tremendous exertions which had been
                    made might now be regarded as made in vain. When we call to mind what had been
                    done we cannot but be filled with astonishment. The movement towards
                    emancipation which had begun in the days of the Renaissance with warm enthusiasm
                    for Greek and Roman antiquity, which next, in England, through the genius of
                    Newton, had acquired as its mainstay a new conception of the universe, and,
                    gradually taking possession of natural science, had brought forth a new
                    philosophy as its offspring and freemasonry as its witness–this same movement
                    had, like a flying spark, been carried, through Voltaire's mind, to France. And
                    here a marvellous thing happened. Only a few decades after Corneille had written
                    <emph>Polyeucte</emph> and Racine <emph>Athalie</emph>, a few years after Bossuet had preached
                    absolute obedience and Pascal written in letters of fire his creed of absolute
                    paradox, a handful of men, most of them exiled or in disgrace, succeeded, under
                    perfectly autocratic rule, in winning over to their opinions first the ablest
                    men of the day, then the upper classes, then princes and princesses who were
                    soon to be kings and empresses, and finally the middle classes. Thus the new
                    truth, which was born in low estate, but was revered even in its cradle by
                    mighty kings–by Frederick of Prussia, <pb n="58"/> Joseph of Austria, and Catherine of
                    Russia–became the great power among the rising generation, numbering among its
                    adherents even abbés and priests.</p>

                <p>Human reason had risen and freed itself with athletic strength. Everything that
                    existed had to justify its existence. Where men heretofore had prayed for a
                    miracle they now investigated into causes. Where they had believed in a miracle
                    they discovered a law. Never before in the history of the world had there been
                    such doubt, such labour, such inquiry, such illumination. The new philosophers
                    had not the weapons of authority at their command, but only those of satire, and
                    it was with satire and mockery that they at first attacked. They annihilated
                    with laughter. On Voltaire's refined scorn followed Rousseau's virulent wrath.
                    Never before had there been such undermining or such declaiming. Human reason,
                    which in every domain had for centuries been compelled to drudge like a serf,
                    which had been intoxicated with legends and lulled to sleep with psalms and set
                    phrases, had been roused as if by the crow of a cock and had leaped up wide
                    awake. Was all that the heroes of reason had thought out, and its martyrs
                    suffered for, now to be swept aside as useless? Were the enthusiasms that had
                    made so many of the noblest hearts beat high, and inspired them with courage on
                    the battlefield and the scaffold, now all to be squeezed together like the
                    genius in the fairy tale, and shut up for good in an iron strong-box sealed with
                    the seal of an Emperor and a Pope?</p>

                <p>For the time being the emancipatory movement was checked. It began once more to
                    be inexpedient not to profess faith in revealed religion, and after the fall of
                    Napoleon it was even dangerous. In religious matters those in power never carry
                    on the controversy by opposing reasons with reasons. The proofs of the
                    gainsayers were not answered by proofs, but by the stopping of commons. The
                    majority of the men without private means who had prepared themselves for
                    government appointments, and could not overcome their irresistible desire to
                    have a three-course dinner every day, were entirely reliable supporters of the
                    re-establishment of the church. No one over twenty-five years of age will be
                    surprised by the number <pb n="59"/> of supporters orthodoxy gained from the moment when it
                    advanced from being an absurdity to being a means of subsistence.</p>

                <p>To such converts add the great party of the timorous, all those who lived in fear
                    of the Red Republic, and in whose eyes religion was, first and foremost, a
                    safeguard against it. It was among these that the army of the principle of
                    authority obtained most recruits. From a religious body the church suddenly
                    turned into a political party.</p>

                <p>A change in outward conditions is always prepared for by a change in opinions,
                    and the outward change even more certainly produces opinions which correspond to
                    the new conditions. The feelings and thoughts which prepared for the Concordat
                    were, after its conclusion, at perfect liberty to express themselves; they
                    called forth others of the same nature; and with the expression of these
                    feelings and thoughts in literature began an intellectual movement which has its
                    point of departure in the Concordat and translates that document into the
                    language of literature. It is the course of this intellectual movement which we
                    are to follow. If we omitted to do so, there would be a sensible hiatus in that
                    psychology of the first half of our century which it is the object of these
                    studies to elaborate. Granted that the subject is not a paying one, that it is
                    neither rich nor attractive, it is nevertheless, from our point of view, a very
                    important one.</p>

                <p>From which class of society did the literary movement emanate? If it could by any
                    possibility have emanated from the peasantry, there might have been something
                    simple-hearted and touching about it; if from the ranks of the hardly tried,
                    suffering priesthood, it would perhaps have attracted attention by its fervour;
                    if it had been the production of the party who, following the example of their
                    ruler, attached themselves to the church from worldly motives, it would have
                    been marked by the absence of any inspiring idea. But none of these supposed
                    cases is the actual one. These three groups formed the public for the new
                    literature, were its sounding-board and echo; not one of them was intellectually
                    fertile. The new Catholic school of <pb n="60"/> literature was destitute of the qualities of
                    simplicity and fervour. But it was not without an inspiring idea. With
                    conviction and determination it vindicates the idea which the Revolution had
                    utterly repudiated and discredited, namely, the principle of authority. Its
                    tendency is rather political than religious. Its leaders do not desire so much
                    to rescue souls as to rescue tradition; they crave for religion as a panacea for
                    lawlessness; the persistency of their appeal to authority is due to their
                    bankruptcy in everything except outward authority.</p>

                <p>The movement begins at widely separated, disconnected points; none of its
                    originators are at first acquainted with each other. During the Revolution
                    Chateaubriand, for instance, is wandering about in America, De Maistre in
                    Switzerland; Bonald plans his first work at Heidelberg. As soon as the
                    intellectual reaction begins, most of the emigrants return home, and the
                    principle of authority is championed in literature both by foreign, independent
                    writers like De Maistre, and by men like Chateaubriand and Bonald, whom
                    Bonaparte's assumption of power recalls to France. These latter attach
                    themselves for the time being to Bonaparte, in his capacity of restorer of the
                    church; but soon, either during his reign or after his fall, they espouse, with
                    far greater warmth, far more strength of conviction, the cause of the Bourbons,
                    to which their own fundamental principle draws them with all the force of
                    consistency. Napoleon's plan of gaining the support of the church and depriving
                    the Bourbons of the sympathy of the clergy by means of the Concordat failed, as
                    it was naturally predestined to do. Soon there was open war between him and the
                    Pope; and soon the literary movement, the origin of which is contemporaneous
                    with the Concordat, declares itself openly on the side of royalty with its
                    supposed rightful claims.</p>

                <p>The originators of the movement naturally feel drawn to each other; they make one
                    another's acquaintance, and soon found a kind of school. They have several
                    important characteristics in common, characteristics which are also to be found
                    even in the latest disciples of the school, men <pb n="61"/> like Lamennais, De Vigny,
                    Lamartine, and Hugo. They are all without exception of noble birth and bound by
                    personal ties to the old royal families. De Maistre was the King of Sardinia's
                    ambassador in Russia. Bonald served in his youth in Louis XV.'s regiment of
                    Musketeers, and during that King's last days went regularly to his bedside to
                    get the parole for the day–he had had smallpox, and consequently ran no risk of
                    infection. The first time his duty brought him into the apartment of the new
                    King, Louis XVI., Marie Antoinette honoured the young Musketeer with a friendly
                    look and a few gracious words. That last glance of a dying King, who bequeathed
                    to his successor a ruined monarchy, and that first look of a young, beautiful,
                    and hopeful Queen were never effaced from Bonald's memory. They became the
                    guiding stars of his life. As to Chateaubriand, directly he heard of the
                    judicial murder of the Duke of Enghien he sent in his resignation as Secretary
                    of Legation under Napoleon's government, and from that moment until 1824 acted
                    the part of a faithful servant of the Bourbons. It was a rôle which he entered
                    into so seriously, and which circumstances rendered so compulsory, that he
                    played it to perfection. As regards the next generation, Lamartine has told us,
                    in the preface to his <emph>Meditations</emph> and in his <emph>Reminiscences</emph> how, as a young
                    officer in the Guards, he galloped by the side of Louis XVIII.'s carriage when
                    that monarch moved from Paris to St. Germain. De Vigny was from his childhood an
                    enthusiastic Royalist; in the days of the Empire his father gave him the Cross
                    of St. Louis to kiss; his ideas of feudal fealty made him an officer of the
                    King; his pride led him to stand to his colours even when all the hopes he had
                    conceived of the Legitimist monarchy were disappointed and superseded by an
                    unexpressed feeling of contempt; after the Revolution of 1830 he became the
                    unprejudiced, but reserved and laconic Conservative whose acquaintance we make
                    in his later works.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">See John Stuart Mill's essay on De Vigny in <emph>Dissertations and Discussions</emph>,
                        i.</note> Victor Hugo has himself sufficiently explained to his
                    readers how powerful was the influence exercised upon him as a young author by
                    the <pb n="62"/> recollection of the Royalist surroundings of his childhood, and especially
                    by the teaching of his mother, the enthusiastically loyal Breton bourgeois.</p>

                <p>The theoretic leaders of this school are not great geniuses. They are strong,
                    despotic characters, who love power because they require obedience, and
                    authority because they desire submission; or they are proud and vain members of
                    the aristocracy of intellect, who would rather bow the knee to a paradox than
                    follow with the crowd of writers who have done homage to reason; or (but this
                    only seldom) they are romanticists, who are moved to tears by the thought of the
                    faith which they no longer possess, but which they make desperate efforts to
                    acquire. They are fighters like De Maistre and Lamennais–men made of the stuff
                    of pontiffs and inquisitors, or they are obstinacy personified, like Bonald and
                    Chateaubriand, who speak as they do more from obstinacy than persuasion. »Moi,
                    catholique entêté,« says Chateaubriand of himself. That is the correct
                    word–obstinate, not fervent.</p>

                <p>Their power over their contemporaries lay in their talent. For talent is such a
                    magician that it can sustain any cause for a considerable time. Chateaubriand
                    was the colourist of the school; De Maistre, with his strength of character, his
                    wit, and his astounding theories, its leader; Bonald, with his rules for
                    everything, its schoolmaster. The best of the young, aspiring poets of the day
                    began their career under its influence, and though it did not retain its hold on
                    them long, it gained by their means a popularity which, added to the authority
                    possessed by its thinkers, was sufficient to make its cause seem for a short
                    time victorious, more especially as the restoration of the Bourbons realised its
                    political ideals.</p>

                <p>In the course of a few years, however, all its best men, with music playing and
                    colours flying, went over to the enemy's camp. The school was dissolved by its
                    own essential unnaturalness. The principle which held it together, that
                    principle of tradition and authority which had presented the appearance of an
                    impregnable fortress, turned out to be undermined, hollow, concealing under its
                    very foundations an unsuspected explosive. Men discovered that <pb n="63"/> they had taken up
                    their position on the top of a powder magazine, and hastened to leave it before
                    it blew up.</p>

                <p>Sylvain Maréchal writes in a book published in 1800 (<emph>Pour et contre la Bible</emph>):
                    »A very decided religious reaction distinguishes this first year of the
                    nineteenth century.« It distinguishes the first twenty, and in countries of slow
                    development and those inclined to be stationary, at least seventy.</p>

                <p>The literary reaction against the spirit of the eighteenth century does not begin
                    as a definitely religious reaction. We have seen that in the group of works
                    which I have designated the »Emigrant Literature« it »has not yet become
                    submission to authority, but is the natural and justifiable defence of feeling,
                    soul, passion, and poetry against frigid intellectuality, exact calculation, and
                    a literature stifled by rules and dead traditions.« Of the first step in this
                    reactionary movement I wrote: »The first move is only to take Rousseau's weapons
                    and direct them against his antagonist, Voltaire.«<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom"><emph>Emigrant Literature</emph>, p. 199.</note> Men are no longer
                    contented with Voltaire's cold deism; they oppose to it Rousseau's copious and
                    vague sentimentality. They follow in Rousseau's footsteps, build on the
                    foundation of his emotionalism and imagination. A glance at the successive
                    phases of the Revolution has shown us that this movement is, as it were,
                    presaged in the midst of the great upheaval by Robespierre's attempt to place
                    Rousseau as an obstacle in the way of the annihilation of all the sentiment
                    which had been so closely associated with the tradition and authority of the
                    church, and which threatened to disappear with the church. In its origin the
                    great religious reaction was, as we have seen, only the revulsion, the revolt,
                    of feeling against reason; what begot it was the perfectly vague craving to feel
                    and to give expression to feeling. The history of the movement is the history of
                    the lamentable manner in which this craving was gradually misdirected.</p>

                <p>The first step in the reaction was the election of Rousseau to lead the revolt,
                    the second was a revolt against Rousseau. Let us open almost any work by Bonald,
                    De Maistre, or <pb n="64"/> Lamennais, and we find that its point of departure is an eager
                    attempt to refute Rousseau, or, rather, to satirise and crush him. During the
                    first stage of the reaction <emph>the principle of sentiment</emph> was opposed to the
                    dominion of reason; during the second, <emph>the principle of authority</emph> is
                    championed against all former principles, that of sentiment included. The
                    transition from the one stage to the other is marked by the endeavour to
                    vindicate and reinstate authority by means of an appeal to sentiment. This is
                    aimed at in Ballanche's <emph>Du Sentiment considéré dans la Littérature et dans les
                    Arts</emph> (1801), and is also the main aim of Chateaubriand's <emph>Génie du
                    Christianisme</emph> (1802).</p>

                <p>Rousseau is now regarded as the most dangerous advocate of the ideas of the
                    eighteenth century. A short account of the charges brought against him will show
                    what there was of truth in them, what of falsehood.</p>

                <p>First, the political attack. A fact which the nineteenth century has repeatedly
                    insisted on, and which must not be forgotten, is that the eighteenth century was
                    devoid of any proper understanding and appreciation of history. One of its most
                    famous representatives, D'Alembert, went so far as to wish that the remembrance
                    of all past times could be blotted out. The naïve belief of Rousseau and his
                    century that isolated thought, unconnected with history or reality, is capable
                    of changing the whole existing order of things, was now universally contested.
                    The preceding generation had believed that all would be well when they had a
                    written constitution which abolished what they considered abuses and established
                    what they regarded as right. They had looked upon this piece of paper, or, to
                    use their phraseology, these tables of the law, as the real constitution. In
                    confutation of this idea, Joseph de Maistre propounds his theory: »Man cannot
                    make a constitution, and a lawful constitution cannot be written.« He is both
                    unmistakably right and extraordinarily wrong.</p>

                <p>He has a prescience of the great truth, which may be regarded as acknowledged in
                    the politics of to-day, that the true constitution of a country is the actual
                    existing distribution of power, a distribution which is not changed although
                    dilettante politicians alter it upon a sheet of <pb n="65"/> paper. In De Maistre's judgment
                    the powers that be have right on their side. Any rebellion seems to him a crime;
                    but, keenly alive to realities, he has no faith in a written constitution as a
                    preventive. Writing on the subject of a preventive of lawlessness, he says: »It
                    may be custom, or conscience, or a papal tiara, or a dagger, but it is always a
                    something.« The written constitution alone is to him nothing real.</p>

                <p>His great mistake is to be found in the reason on which he bases his aversion to
                    this written constitution. He is of opinion that what is written, what is
                    foreseen and determined by human wisdom, is to be regarded as an infringement on
                    the province of divine providence. »It is impertinence towards God not to have
                    confidence in the unforeseen future; every government which is founded upon
                    settled laws is founded upon a usurpation of the prerogative of the divine
                    law-giver.« The real working constitution he regards, on the contrary, as being
                    of a divine nature, for, from his orthodox standpoint, he maintains that it is
                    God who makes the nations what they are. To the sovereignty of the people he,
                    like Bonald and Lamennais, opposes the sovereignty of God, thus finally
                    anchoring in theocracy.</p>

                <p>Rousseau's political theories were undoubtedly most imperfect, and it was easy to
                    perceive the dangers that lay concealed in them. His principle, that no one is
                    bound to obey laws to which he has not given his consent, not only strikes at
                    the authority which is power, but also at the authority which is simply a form
                    of reason, and thus makes all government impossible. His second principle, that
                    sovereignty is an attribute of the people, may, if the word »people« be unwisely
                    apprehended, lead to tyranny of the majority and make all liberty impossible.
                    His third great principle, that all men are equal, may lead to universal
                    levelling instead of to justice. Here are enough points of attack for a
                    criticism undertaken from the modern standpoint. Hegel in his day attempted such
                    a criticism. He propounded a new interpretation of the sovereignty of the
                    people, defining it as really meaning the sovereignty of the state. Heiberg, who
                    was given to carrying the Hegelian <pb n="66"/> theories to extremes, presents us (in his
                    essay »On Authority«) with Hegel's idea in the astounding and reactionary
                    proposition that »it is a matter of no consequence whether or not the interests
                    of the citizens are furthered by the development of the state, since it is not
                    the state which exists for the sake of the citizens, but the citizens who exist
                    for the sake of the state.«<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Hegel, <emph>Werke</emph>, viii., »Philosophie des Rechts,« 367; Heiberg, <emph>Pros.
                        Skrifter</emph>, 10 B, 335.</note> Though we of the present day have a distinct
                    antipathy to such propositions, we nevertheless give to these protests against
                    Rousseau's theories the attention which we consider due to any development of
                    modern thought. But the protests of De Maistre's day were neither based on
                    thought nor on reason, but purely and simply on belief in authority; and the
                    opposition is, moreover, dishonourable in its methods; the attack is always
                    directed against some isolated proposition, which, if we read it with the desire
                    to understand it, is comprehensible, but which it is easy to reduce to an
                    absurdity, because of the audacious manner in which it is expressed.</p>

                <p>Bonald, for instance, scoffs at Rousseau for saying: »A people has always the
                    right to change its laws, even the best of them; for if it chooses to do itself
                    an injury, who has the right to prevent it?« The proposition is a rash one, but
                    it does not in reality justify the retrogressive step; it only denies the right
                    of outsiders to make it an excuse for interfering; and the reader is
                    unpleasantly affected when he discovers that the reason why Bonald is so
                    exasperated by these words is that he considers the law-giving power to be the
                    prerogative of God, not of the people.</p>

                <p>Rousseau's social theories were also violently attacked. It is not difficult to
                    understand how Rousseau, with the society of his own day before his eyes, should
                    arrive at the conclusion that it would be quite possible to do without a society
                    at all; but this mistaken idea, in combination with the fanciful one of a lost,
                    happy, natural condition, led him to formulate such a proposition as: »Man is
                    born good, and society corrupts him,« and to give utterance to the comic
                    paradox, which reappears in all the polemical works of the <pb n="67"/> Restoration period,
                    pierced with refutations as a pin-cushion is with pins: »The man who thinks is a
                    degenerate animal.« Such utterances lent themselves to attack. In the ardour of
                    his impeachment of society, Rousseau permits himself to say: »Society is not a
                    consequence of the nature of man. Everything that has not its origin in the
                    nature of things has disadvantages, and civil society has most of all.«
                    »Society!« cries Bonald, not without eloquence; »as if society consisted of the
                    walls of our houses or the ramparts of our towns! as if there were not, wherever
                    a human being is born, a father, a mother, a child, a language, heaven, earth,
                    God, and society!« The doctrine he instils into his contemporaries is that the
                    earliest society was a family, and that in the family authority is not elective,
                    but a result of the nature of things. To the doctrine that society is the result
                    of a voluntary agreement, of a contract, he opposes his doctrine that society is
                    enforced (<emph>obligée</emph>), is the production of a power–whether it be the power of
                    persuasion or of arms. To the theory that power, that authority, originally
                    received the law from the people he opposes his theory that there can be no
                    people before there is a power. To the revolutionary principle that society is
                    <emph>fraternity and equality</emph> he opposes the principle of patriarchal absolutism,
                    that society is <emph>paternity and dependence</emph>. Power belongs to God, and is
                    communicated by Him. Here again the argument of historical actuality proves
                    extraordinarily convincing, and the author seizes the opportunity to deduce, as
                    it were surreptitiously, the doctrine of the one and only lawful sovereignty,
                    sovereignty by the grace of God, from our respect for history and reality.</p>

                <p>In order to strike as deadly a blow as possible at Rousseau's conception of the
                    state as a contract, this conception was represented as not only foolish, but
                    actually criminal. And yet it is but the natural, the inevitable outcome of the
                    eighteenth century's over-estimation of the conscious side of human life and
                    want of understanding of the unconscious, the instinctive. How much more justly
                    does Hegel judge Rousseau! He gives him the credit of having laid down a
                    principle, »the constituent of which is thought«–in other words, will–as the
                    principle of the state, observing that he <pb n="68"/> was only mistaken in understanding by
                    will merely the individual, conscious, and arbitrary will, a misunderstanding
                    which leads to »other, merely reasonable conclusions, subversive of the
                    absolutely divine, and its authority and majesty.«<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Hegel, <emph>Werke</emph>, viii. 314.</note> In the <emph>Contrat Social</emph>
                    Jean-Jacques had attempted to find the basis of governments and laws in the
                    nature of man and society, taken purely in the abstract. But before Rousseau's
                    day Montesquieu had written: »I have never heard law discussed without a careful
                    investigation being made into the origin of societies, a proceeding which to me
                    seems perfectly absurd. If human beings did not form a society, if they avoided
                    or fled from one another, one would ask the reason and try to find out why they
                    kept separate; but, as it is, they are all born bound to each other. A son is
                    born in his father's home and remains connected with him–this is society and
                    its cause.«</p>

                <p>If, for the relation of the child to the father, we substitute the relation to
                    the mother, as being even a closer one, the reasoning is perfectly correct. But
                    Rousseau, leaving this solution out of the question, desired to show what ideas
                    had led men to hold together, what aim they proposed to themselves in so doing,
                    and by what means they could best attain this aim. Now, it admits of no dispute
                    that it is only by the mutual consent of its members that society exists. This
                    consent or contract is most undoubtedly the spiritual basis on which society
                    rests; but the contract is entered into tacitly, is an understood thing, has
                    always existed, has consequently no external actuality. In exactly the same
                    manner we accept the geometric definition of the origin of a ball: A ball, or
                    sphere, is generated by the revolution of a semicircle about its diameter. The
                    definition is perfectly correct, but has no connection whatever with the
                    material conditions requisite to the existence of any given ball. Never yet has
                    a ball been made by causing a semicircle to revolve round its axis.</p>

                <p>This same figure may be retained as giving an exact idea of the style of
                    reasoning on social subjects characteristic of the eighteenth century, nay, of
                    the whole intellectual ten<pb n="69"/>dency of the century. It is a dissolving, isolating
                    tendency; it is in the direction of geometry and algebra; men endeavour to
                    comprehend the most difficult and most complicated real situations by the aid of
                    abstract ideas. This is a weakness which enables Bonald to gain an easy victory
                    by an appeal to the principle of power. He opposes Rousseau's disintegrating
                    theories with the doctrines of the days of the old absolute monarchy: »God is
                    the sovereign <emph>power</emph> that rules all beings; the God-man is the <emph>power</emph> that
                    rules mankind, the head of the state is the power that rules all his subjects,
                    the head of the family is the <emph>power</emph> in his house. As all power is created in
                    the image of God and originates with God, all power is absolute.«<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Haller, in his famous <emph>Restauration der Staatswissenschaft</emph>, chooses exactly
                        the same point of departure as Bonald, namely, an attack on <emph>Le Contrat
                            Social</emph>.</note></p>

                <p>Rousseau is, thirdly, attacked in the domain of morality. He had endeavoured to
                    make »the inward, unwritten law,« of which Antigone speaks, the source of every
                    outward moral law. He had said: »What God desires man to do, He does not let him
                    know through another man; He tells him it Himself, writes it on the table of his
                    heart.« If this be the case, what becomes of tradition and authority and
                    revelations at second hand? Bonald consequently replies: »If man were obliged to
                    obey this inward law, he would be as devoid of will as the stone, which must
                    submit to the law of gravitation; if, on the contrary, he is at liberty not to
                    obey it, an <emph>authority</emph> is required, which shall direct his attention to these
                    laws and teach him to obey them.« Thus in morals too the guiding power is
                    transferred from man's own inward feeling to outward authority.</p>

                <p>The antagonism to Rousseau is so strong that Bonald, for instance, writes page
                    upon page of declamation against the philosopher's appeal to mothers to nurse
                    their children themselves. One would imagine that, in this instance at least,
                    Rousseau's theories would meet with the approval of the stern inculcators of
                    duty. Not at all–the appeal in question shows that Jean-Jacques looked upon
                    human beings as simply animals. »J. J. Rousseau declared in the name of nature
                    that it was the duty of women to suckle their chil<pb n="70"/>dren, exactly as she-animals
                    do, and for the same reason.... Fathers and mothers, regarded by the
                    philosophers as simply males and females, in turn regarded their children simply
                    as their young.«<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Bonald, <emph>Du Divorce, considéré au 19me siècle relativement à l'état
                        domestique et à l'état publique de la société</emph> (edition of 1817, pp. 29 and
                        31).</note> And why is Bonald so wrathful? Evidently because he fears
                    that Rousseau may deprive religion of some of its credit by issuing a reasonable
                    commandment not inscribed on the tables of its laws. »Rousseau,« he goes on to
                    say, »probably imagined that he had surprised religion in the neglect of a duty;
                    but possibly religion, more far-sighted than he, feared anything which might
                    serve young married people as a reason or excuse for living separated from each
                    other, even momentarily.« The motherly solicitude of the Catholic church for the
                    happiness of spouses and the multiplication of the human race–this also is to
                    be placed in the clearest light by means of an attack on Rousseau.</p>

                <p>We have seen to what misunderstanding of the idea of society the unhistoric,
                    mathematical line of thought of the eighteenth century led. A kindred line of
                    thought produced a very similar misunderstanding of poetry. In their admiration
                    for mathematical reasonableness, and for the certainty with which general truths
                    had been arrived at by mathematical inferences, men were eager to communicate to
                    language, as far as possible, the quality of mathematically exact expression.
                    Condillac defined science as <emph>une langue bien faite, i.e.</emph> a perfectly clear and
                    perfectly exact language. The fact was not sufficiently appreciated that, when
                    it is desired to reproduce impressions which are different in different persons,
                    and which even in the same person may change from one moment to another, a
                    flexible, impressionable language is required, a language which accepts its
                    spirit and whole stamp from the person using it. Scientific men began to deride
                    what they called poetry and style, and maintained that in writing thought was
                    everything, form nothing. Barante, who, in a critical work published at the
                    beginning of the new century, was the first to protest against these ideas of
                    his <pb n="71"/> age, argues cleverly: »When Chimène says to Rodrigue: 'Go! I do not hate
                    thee,' it is plain, if we submit these words to calm investigation, that they
                    mean the same as if she had said: 'Go! I love thee'; and yet, if she used the
                    latter expression, she would be quite a different being; her consideration for
                    her father would be gone, and so would her modesty and her charm.«</p>

                <p>The poets, who were in reality influenced by the same ideas as the scientists,
                    and were as far as they from conceiving of style as the direct outcome of the
                    personality, set themselves to work to fabricate style, and spoke of it as we
                    speak of the music composed for any given libretto. They looked upon the art of
                    writing as a perfectly external art, and the descriptive school, with Delille at
                    their head, took unpoetic themes–physics, botany, astronomy, sea-voyages–and
                    out of them manufactured style. (See poetical works of Boisjolin, Gudin, Aimé
                    Martin, and Esménard.) Cournand actually wrote a poem in four cantos on style
                    itself and its various species. Poetry was regarded as an artificial form
                    communicated to the matured thought. This was the idea which Buffon had
                    contradicted in his notable proposition: <emph>Le style c'est l'homme même</emph>, a
                    proposition which was presently to become the most hackneyed of quotations,
                    inevitable whenever the subject of style was broached, and employed by none so
                    frequently as by those who were neither men nor possessors of style.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">We owe to Madame Girardin the one witty thing that has been said on the
                        subject of Buffon's dictum. When trying to prove that in each of George Sand's
                        novels the influence of some real personage enthusiastically admired by the
                        authoress is to be distinctly traced, she quotes the saying of a wit: »It is
                        when we are criticising the works of women writers that we are most often
                        obliged to exclaim with Buffon: <emph>Le style c'est l'homme</emph>.« (Le Vicomte de
                        Launay, <emph>Lettres parisiennes</emph>, i. 89).</note> The
                    poets of the eighteenth century derived their conception of the nature of poetry
                    from their own practice. As their own poetry, their own language, was not a
                    natural product, but the result of labour and the observance of certain rules
                    respecting elegance of expression, choice of similes, and employment of
                    mythology, they naturally believed that language and thought originated
                    independently of each other.</p>

                <p>When Bonald, in opposition to their theory, propounds <pb n="72"/> his, namely, that language
                    and thought cannot be separated–the theory upon which (in his principal work,
                    <emph>La législation primitive</emph>) he founds his whole system–he is unquestionably in
                    the right. But this doctrine meets with the same fate as other doctrines
                    propounded by the restorers of the past; the disease of orthodoxy from which the
                    author suffers causes him to twist and turn every true thought until he makes a
                    perfect monster out of it. »The answer to the vital question regarding the
                    intellectual life of man may,« says Bonald, »be given in the following form: Man
                    must think his words before he speaks his thought. In other words, man must know
                    the word before he speaks it, which self-evident fact excludes all possibility
                    of his having himself invented language.« Thus Bonald arrives at the favourite
                    theory of the nineteenth-century reactionaries, namely, that language was
                    originally given to man by God. Kierkegaard expresses the same idea when he
                    declares that it cannot possibly be conceded that man himself invented language
                    (<emph>On the Idea of Fear</emph>). Why? Because it was revealed to him by God, ready
                    made.</p>

                <p>It is Locke's and Condillac's reasonable theory of the slow evolution of language
                    and ideas which Bonald contradicts with his principle of the necessity of an
                    original revelation of language and ideas. Upon this belief of his he bases
                    nothing less than the dogma of the existence of God, which entails all the
                    others. To it we always come back, turn where we will. As none of the
                    reactionaries have any idea of science–they are men of good parts with such an
                    education as is given in the Jesuit schools–there is nothing in the way of
                    scientific nonsense which they do not talk and write. The science of language is
                    sacrificed along with political and social science on the altar of theocracy. It
                    may be mentioned as a remarkable instance of the manner in which these
                    reactionaries held together that in 1814 Bonald published a new edition of De
                    Maistre's work, <emph>Sur le principe générateur des constitutions politiques</emph>, that
                    is to say, he circulated a book in which written constitutions were strongly
                    condemned, although he himself, arguing from the standpoint of his <pb n="73"/> theory of the
                    direct revelation of language, had come to the conclusion that every
                    commandment, from the ten commandments downwards, must have been noted down,
                    must exist in black and white. But to him, as to De Maistre, the real matter of
                    importance was that the constitution should make no concession to the spirit of
                    the times, that authority should stand secure, unimperilled by the gales of
                    liberty; therefore he did not hesitate to profit by the aid of a co-religionary,
                    even though he differed from him on an important point.</p>

                <p>It was not enough for the reactionaries that they themselves had been brought up
                    in the Jesuit schools; they were fain to have the whole youth of the nation sent
                    there. De Maistre was all his life the patron and ardent champion of the
                    Jesuits. At the court of St. Petersburg he exposed himself to much
                    unpleasantness rather than throw them over.</p>

                <p>The third part of Bonald's <emph>Législation primitive</emph>, which treats chiefly of
                    education, is directed against Rousseau's <emph>Émile</emph>; he cannot forgive this book
                    for teaching that religion ought not to form a part of children's education. In
                    all seriousness he mentions, as an example of the fatal results of Rousseau's
                    principles of education, that during the last five months seventy-five children
                    have been sentenced to punishment for various crimes. He then proceeds to
                    expound his own principles. Their aim, as was to be expected, is the suppression
                    of all individuality. »We require a continuous, universal, uniform (<emph>perpétuel,
                    universel, uniforme</emph>) course of instruction, and consequently continuity,
                    universality, and uniformity in our teachers; therefore we must have a corps of
                    teachers, for without a corps we can ensure neither continuity nor universality
                    nor uniformity.« He maintains that married teachers cannot be expected to
                    sacrifice themselves to their calling, and unmarried ones are equally
                    unserviceable unless they are under the restraint of religious vows; »for
                    secular teachers, even though they be unmarried, are incapable of forming a real
                    corps, because they enter it and leave it according to their own inclination and
                    caprice; moreover, no father of a family would dare to entrust his children <pb n="74"/> to
                    an unmarried man whose morals were not certified by his religious vows and
                    discipline.« By force of these arguments he arrives at the conclusion that the
                    whole education of the nation should be entrusted to the clergy, should be
                    distinctly religious, and should early accustom children to reverence that
                    authority to which they are to submit throughout their lives.</p>

                <p>Obstinate insistence on the principle of authority is, then, the distinctive, the
                    ruling feature of this literary group. The French rebuilders of society champion
                    the principle with much more ardour than those of Germany, partly because of
                    their racial peculiarities, partly because of their different religion. The
                    reactionary movement in German literature has its origin, as we have seen, in
                    the law-defying self-assertion and self-will of the individual.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Cf. <emph>The Romantic School in Germany</emph>, p. 42.</note> In spite of
                    its Catholic tendencies and its apery of Catholicism, German Romanticism never
                    became so entirely Catholic, so deferential to authority, as the French
                    reaction. Teutonic and Protestant self-will always militated against this. The
                    French mind yielded easily. And it must be allowed that there is something
                    attractive in the complete, unmitigated reaction which is lacking in the
                    undecided, incomplete reaction.</p>

                <p>Even when the revulsion is at hand, and the dissolution of the school fast
                    approaching, we find Lamennais maintaining in his book on indifference in the
                    matter of religion that it is not sentiment, and still less the spirit of
                    investigation, which is the mark of true religion, but that »the true religion
                    is incontestably the religion which is founded upon the strongest possible
                    <emph>visible authority</emph>.« And from the very beginning of the movement the utterances
                    of all its adherents breathe the same spirit. To Bonald religion is a kind of
                    police for maintaining order. In proof of this let me quote a few sentences
                    which I have collected from his works:–</p>

                <p>»Religion, which is the <emph>bond</emph> in every society, more especially tightens the
                    knot of political society; the very word religion (<emph>religare</emph>) sufficiently
                    indicates that it is the natural and necessary <emph>bond</emph> of human society in
                    general, <pb n="75"/> of the family, and of the state.–Religion introduces <emph>order</emph> into
                    society, because it teaches men whence <emph>power</emph> and duties proceed.–The
                    principles <emph>of order</emph> are an essential part of religion.–Religion will triumph
                    because, as Malebranche says, <emph>order</emph> is the inviolable law of minds.« Rejoicing
                    at the spread of the reaction, he exclaims: »We already see all European authors
                    who have any real title to fame acknowledging or defending the necessity of the
                    Christian religion, and stamping their works with the seal of its immortality;
                    for–let authors mark this well–all works in which the fundamental principles
                    of <emph>order</emph> are denied or controverted will disappear; only those in which they
                    are acknowledged and reverently upheld will descend with honour to posterity.«
                    We observe that there is no question here of piety, of fervent faith, of
                    sentiment. Religion is the bond, is order, is the principle of authority. How
                    far we are from Germany, where even moonlight sentimentality turned into
                    religion!</p>

                <p>Curiously enough, this enthusiastic vindication of religion as order gives Bonald
                    a certain resemblance (which he himself would have angrily refused to
                    acknowledge) to the man he detested almost more than any other, namely,
                    Robespierre. Robespierre, too, had a passionate love of order, and for its sake
                    desired a state religion. The difference is that Robespierre only wished such
                    order as would preserve the gains of the Revolution, whilst to Bonald the word
                    meant the sum and substance of all old tradition.</p>

                <p>He and De Maistre are at one on this point. De Maistre says: »Without a Pope no
                    sovereignty, without sovereignty no unity, without unity no <emph>authority</emph>, without
                    authority no faith.« He places monarchy beyond the reach of all criticism and
                    investigation by pronouncing it to be a <emph>miracle</emph>. He eulogises brute force as
                    such. In his books he submits military society to the discipline of the
                    corporal's cane, civil society to that of the executioner's axe.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Cf. <emph>The Romantic School in Germany</emph>, pp. 12, 326.</note> This last
                    was the measure which Robespierre took in grim reality, though not until he saw
                    no salvation for the Revolution except in a dictatorship. Thus De Maistre, too,
                    has his points of <pb n="76"/> resemblance to Robespierre. He puts the finishing touch to his
                    work in a eulogy of the Inquisition.</p>

                <p>What these writers vindicate is, then, authority and power. In the state
                    authority is overthrown by popular institutions which entail compulsory changes
                    of ministry; in religion it is endangered when the clergy attain to comparative
                    independence of Rome (hence De Maistre's book against Gallicanism), or are made
                    completely independent (»by Presbyterianism,« as Bonald has it); in the family
                    it is done away with from the moment that divorce is permitted under any
                    circumstances whatsoever. King, minister, and subject; Pope, priest, and flock;
                    husband, wife, and child–these are to Bonald inseparable triads, formed after
                    the image of the Trinity. And in their inseparability they safeguard the great
                    fundamental principles of authority and order.</p>

                <p>By sounding here and sounding there, and everywhere coming upon the same
                    fundamental thought, we have discovered what was the ruling idea of the new
                    period. It may be called by many names. It is the great principle of
                    <emph>externality</emph>, as opposed to that of inward, personal feeling and private
                    investigation; it is the great principle of <emph>theocracy</emph>, of the sovereignty of
                    God, as opposed to the sovereignty of the people; it is the principle of
                    <emph>authority and power</emph>, as opposed to the principles of liberty, of human rights,
                    and of human interdependence. And when we examine the life of the day in all its
                    various developments, we everywhere find the same watchword and the same white
                    flag. The fundamental idea sets its mark upon everything.</p>

                <p>In the state it leads to the principle of right being superseded by the principle
                    of might–which goes by the name of divine power, and becomes monarchy by the
                    grace of God. In society it banishes the idea of fraternity, substituting a
                    half-patriarchal, half-tyrannical paternal relation–the idea of equality being
                    simultaneously superseded by that of dependence. In the domain of morality it
                    effaces the inward law and substitutes papal bulls and the decrees of church
                    councils. It does not look upon religion as faith, but as a bond, as the
                    »political fetter« which the Revolutionists had so lately upbraided it with
                    being. It champions in<pb n="77"/>dissolubility in marriage and in the state. It teaches
                    that language was a direct gift to man from God, thereby stifling the science of
                    language at its birth in order to erect a theological pyramid above its corpse.
                    It makes real scientific progress impossible by keeping all inquiry and research
                    in the leading-strings of powerful outward authority. It dulls the understanding
                    of the rising generation by entrusting its education to a corps of cultivated,
                    well-bred half-men, sworn to blind obedience to the General of the Jesuit
                    order.</p>

                <p>And as this same idea, not long after its first vigorous appearance, attains to
                    the possession of a literature, it soon sets its mark upon fiction, upon lyric
                    poetry, from ballad and song to ode and hymn, nay, even upon the drama. In
                    literature, too, the lily reigns. The new school becomes known as the seraphic
                    school. Its heroes, its typical characters, are martyrs, as in Chateaubriand's
                    writings, or prophets, as in Hugo's and De Vigny's. Its poets seek their
                    inspiration and their points of departure in the Bible and Milton. Authoresses
                    like Madame de Krüdener play the rôle of prophetesses, and as such exercise a
                    distinct influence on the social development of the period. The consecration of
                    the King and the birth of the Crown Prince call forth high-flown and deeply
                    reflective poems from such authors as Hugo and Lamartine. The birth of the Count
                    de Chambord is little less than a miracle, and is celebrated in song throughout
                    the country. Chateaubriand, with the cross in his hands, drives heathen
                    mythology out of fiction; and with the cross in their hands, Lamartine and Hugo
                    expel it from lyric poetry. On the stage the Knights Templar and the Maccabees
                    (whose acquaintance we made in Zacharias Werner's <emph>Sons of the Vale</emph> and <emph>The
                    Mother of the Maccabees</emph>) make their appearance, the former introduced by
                    Raynouard, the latter by Guiraud. There is not a feeling in the human heart, not
                    a corner of the human mind, and not a branch of literature, upon which this
                    restoration of the spirit of the past does not set its stamp during its day of
                    power.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Bonald, <emph>Théorie du pouvoir</emph>, i-iii.; <emph>La législation primitive; Essai

                <p>Chateaubriand's book, <emph>Le Génie du Christianisme</emph>, which originally bore the
                    significant title <emph>Beautés de la Religion Chrétienne</emph>, marks the transition from
                    the first to the second stage of the reaction, because, cold and devoid of real
                    feeling as it is, it is an attempt to vindicate and rehabilitate authority by
                    means of an appeal to sentiment and imagination.</p>

                <p>It was a defence of Christianity of a perfectly new species, from the fact that
                    it appealed to imagination, not to faith; to sentiment, not to reason. It
                    impresses one as being proffered under the conviction that reason was now
                    inimical to Christianity, and that faith no longer existed.</p>

                <p>The author, not many years before he wrote this work, had been a free-thinker,
                    indeed a materialist. We have proof of this in some marginal notes in his own
                    handwriting, discovered by Sainte-Beuve in a book which had belonged to him.
                    Alongside of the words: »God, matter, and destiny are one,« Chateaubriand has
                    written: »This is my system; this is what I believe.« Alongside of the following
                    sentences: »You say that God has created you free. That is not the point in
                    question. Did he foresee that I should fall, that I should be miserable to all
                    eternity? Yes, undoubtedly. In that case your God is nothing but a horrible and
                    unreasonable tyrant,« we read in the margin: »This objection is irrefutable, and
                    completely demolishes the whole edifice of Christian doctrine. But in any case
                    it is doctrine which no one believes in now.«</p>

                <p>This is the standpoint of Chateaubriand's youth, but one to which he did not long
                    adhere. He was too much the born doubter to be able to hold firmly to even a
                    negative conviction. What there was of faith in the philosophy of the eighteenth
                    century, namely, its belief in the steady progress of humanity,<!-- Illustration: [CHATEAUBRIAND] --> <pb n="79"/> was probably
                    what he first rejected, and on the loss of this conviction quickly followed the
                    loss of all the rest. He himself attributes his conversion to the influence of
                    his mother's dying prayer to him to keep to her faith. »I wept and believed,« he
                    says.</p>

                <p>Himself converted, or half converted, by means of sentiment, he now endeavoured
                    to influence others in the same manner. Although intellectual receptivity for
                    the dogmas of Christianity was no longer to be looked for, it was surely still
                    possible to arouse sympathy with its touching, noble poetry. It was an idea
                    characteristic of both the period and the man, this of transforming the apology
                    for Christianity into aesthetics. He devotes a whole chapter to the sweet,
                    melodious music of the church bells. He describes the simple village church,
                    with its feeling of innocence and peace. He presents us with pictures and
                    symbols when we expect proofs. Bonald remarked that in books which were works of
                    reason, such as his own, truth displayed itself like a king at the head of his
                    army on the day of battle, while in books like Chateaubriand's <emph>Génie du
                    Christianisme</emph> it had more resemblance to a queen on her coronation day,
                    surrounded with everything magnificent and beautiful that could be got together.
                    His meaning is that Chateaubriand aims rather at moving men than at convincing
                    them. In private conversation he expressed himself more bluntly. He said: »I
                    gave my pills as they were; he gave his with sugar.«</p>

                <p>Certainly no book affords a clearer indication of the want of serious reality in
                    the religious regeneration of the day. Its point of view is that which men have
                    agreed to call the romantic. It is to the past it turns, and as the Romanticist
                    is a man of imagination, he sees the past in an imaginary light. The religion of
                    the Romanticist is a parade religion, a tool for the politician, a lyre for the
                    poet, a symbol for the philosopher, a fashion for the man of the world.</p>

                <p>Like the German, the Danish, and, at a later period, the French Romanticists,
                    Chateaubriand loves the mysterious. He begins his vindication of belief in
                    authority by appealing to men's sense of mystery in life generally: »There is
                    nothing beautiful or sweet or great in life that is not mys<pb n="80"/>terious. The most
                    wonderful feelings are those which at once move and perplex us. Bashfulness,
                    chaste love, pure friendship, are full of mystery.... Is not innocence, which in
                    its essence is nothing but holy ignorance, the most ineffable mystery? Women,
                    the more admirable half of the human race, cannot live without mysteries.« The
                    transition from this to the dogmas of a so-called revealed religion strikes us
                    as sudden.</p>

                <p>De Maistre makes a somewhat similar use of mystery. When he has shown that such
                    and such a social institution is inexplicable, he believes that he has proved it
                    to be divine. There is, in his opinion, no reasonable explanation for hereditary
                    royalty and hereditary nobility–which is proof sufficient that they exist by
                    the grace of God. What is there to be said in defence of war? Hardly anything,
                    thinks De Maistre; consequently war too is a mystery. A little reflection shows
                    us the necessity of such argument. Authority demands mystery as its counterpart.
                    Note what Michaud says in the dedication of his poem, »An Exile's Spring« (<emph>Le
                    printemps d'un proscrit</emph>), 1803: »Society ought to have its mysterious side as
                    well as religion; I have always thought that we should at times believe in the
                    laws of our country as we believe in the commandments of God. In private as well
                    as in public life there are things which a man does better if he does them
                    without reflecting upon his reason for acting.«</p>

                <p>The style of Chateaubriand's work is dazzlingly brilliant. But for this it would
                    not have created the sensation it did. It contains descriptions of nature,
                    emotional outbursts, and some few sparsely scattered thoughts of real value. But
                    all that is of genuine value from the literary and poetical point of view is to
                    be found in the tales <emph>Atala</emph> and <emph>René</emph>, which, according to Chateaubriand's
                    original plan, were to have formed chapters of the work–where they would have
                    cut a curious figure among such chapters as those on missionaries and sisters of
                    mercy. They were, preliminarily, sent out as feelers long before the main work,
                    and they do not concern us now; we have studied them in their historical
                    significance in their proper place.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom"><emph>Emigrant Literature</emph>, pp. 17, 33.</note></p>

                <p><pb n="81"/> In <emph>Le Génie du Christianisme</emph> Chateaubriand did not, he has himself told us,
                    endeavour to prove that Christianity is excellent because it comes from God, but
                    that it comes from God because it is excellent.</p>

                <p>He shows that men have been wrong in despising Christianity, that it has
                    beautiful, noble, poetic qualities. He does not perceive that, even if he
                    succeeds in proving in many instances the narrowness of view of those
                    Encyclopedists whom he is continually attacking, this in itself is no manner of
                    proof of the divine origin of religion.</p>

                <p>The whole work is in reality an outcome of the dislike and contempt which he had
                    gradually developed for the philosophy and literature of the eighteenth century.
                    The spirit of this philosophy and literature now appeared to him to be fatal to
                    all the higher desires and aspirations of the human soul. The eighteenth century
                    had misunderstood feeling and poetry. Therefore what it had exalted must be
                    condemned, and what it had dared to disdain must be exalted. And for what had it
                    shown greater contempt than for Christianity!</p>

                <p>Chateaubriand was not a man of a pious, but of an artistic nature; and he
                    conceived a fruitful artistic idea. Perceiving that the classic period in France
                    had reached the term of its natural life, he contended that the imitation of the
                    works of heathen antiquity ought now to cease. It had gone on, at least in
                    appearance, for not less than 250 years. Poets had neglected national and
                    religious subjects for those of ancient mythology; by the end of the eighteenth
                    century they were not even imitating antiquity, but the seventeenth-century
                    authors of their own country. Now there had been enough of it; now it was time
                    for France to dismiss mythology and have a literature inspired by its own
                    history and its own religion.</p>

                <p>In this roundabout way Chateaubriand arrived at his vindication of the beauty of
                    Christianity, and of its superiority in artistic value to any of the heathen
                    religions.</p>

                <p>The nature of the vindication evidences the nature of the whole movement which
                    the work inaugurates. Its æsthetic part is preceded by a dogmatic introduction
                    which, in keeping with the rest of the book, aims at proving the <pb n="82"/> beauty of the
                    dogmas of Christianity. I adduce a few examples of the absurd results of this
                    »how beautiful!« style of reasoning.</p>

                <p>Of the sacrament of the Lord's Supper Chateaubriand writes: »We do not know what
                    objections could be offered to a means of grace which evokes such a chain of
                    poetical, moral, historical, and supernatural ideas, a means of grace which,
                    beginning with flowers, youth, and charm, ends with bringing God down to earth
                    to give Himself as spiritual sustenance to man.« What objection indeed could be
                    offered? None, if all this be true.</p>

                <p>In spite of his æsthetic bias, Chateaubriand sets to work with a good deal of
                    pedantry. Celibacy, as enjoined on the Catholic priesthood, is considered first
                    from the moral point of view, and, thus considered, is denominated the most
                    moral of institutions. A second chapter, with the somewhat comical title:
                    »Virginity, considered from the poetical point of view,« is devoted to the same
                    subject. It ends with the following burst of eloquence: »Thus we see that
                    virginity, beginning in the lowest link of the chain of beings (its significance
                    among animals had been taken into consideration), makes its way upwards to man,
                    from man to the angels, and from the angels to God, to lose itself in Him.« In
                    the original edition, as if this were not enough, there was added: »God is the
                    great solitary, the eternal celibate of the universe.« It is curious that no
                    notice should be taken of His paternal relation to the second person of the
                    Trinity. But this omission makes the appeal to the case of the Saviour the more
                    effective. Chateaubriand says: »The law-giver of Christianity was born of a
                    virgin and died virgin.« And to this he adds: »Did he not intend thereby to
                    teach us that the earth, as regarded human beings, was now, both for political
                    and natural reasons, sufficiently populated, and that, far from multiplying the
                    race, we ought rather to restrict its increase?«</p>

                <p>We are struck dumb by finding Malthus's theory of population come out as the sum
                    and end of this Christian Romanticism. Who would have believed that there was so
                    much political economy in the Gospels!</p>

                <p><pb n="83"/> On the subject of the Trinity we read: »In nature the number 3 seems to be the
                    number superior to all others; it is not a product; hence Pythagoras calls it
                    the number without a mother. Even in the doctrines of polytheistic religions we
                    here and there come upon a dim intuition of the Trinity. The Graces chose its
                    number as theirs.«</p>

                <p>Thus in Chateaubriand's imagination the Trinity is upborne by the three Graces as
                    Caryatides. In keeping with this is his attempt to prove the divine origin of
                    the cross from the existence of the constellation, the Southern Cross.</p>

                <p>In keeping with his defence of Christian dogma is such a defence of the Christian
                    form of worship as the following: »Speaking generally, we may answer that the
                    rites of Christianity are in the highest degree moral, if for no other reason
                    than that they have been practised by our fathers, that our mothers have watched
                    over our cradles as Christian women, that the Christian religion has chanted its
                    psalms over our parents' coffins and invoked peace upon them in their graves.«
                    If argument were required when it is perfectly self-evident that the same
                    defence may be offered for any religion, we might urge that it is a very
                    unsuitable one in this particular case, where the object in view was to induce
                    sons to abjure the anti-Christian beliefs professed by their fathers.</p>

                <p>No less droll are the arguments drawn from natural history to prove the love
                    displayed in the order of the universe. Chateaubriand writes: »Is an alligator,
                    is a serpent, is a tiger less loving to its young than a nightingale, a hen, or
                    even a woman?... Is it not as wonderful as it is touching to see an alligator
                    build a nest and lay eggs like a hen, and a little monster come out of the shell
                    just like a chicken? How many touching truths are contained in this strange
                    contrast! how it leads us to love the goodness of God!«</p>

                <p>Chateaubriand is positively jocose in his attempts to prove the divine purpose
                    evident in nature. He declares that the birds of passage come to us at a season
                    when the earth yields no crops on purpose to be fed; and he maintains that the
                    domestic animals are born with exactly the amount of instinct required to enable
                    us to tame them.</p>

                <p><pb n="84"/> When the Neo-Catholic authors embark on any subject connected with natural
                    science, they at once become extremely comic. Any one interested should read (in
                    his review of Bonald's <emph>La législation primitive</emph>) Chateaubriand's outburst of
                    horror at having heard a little boy answer his teacher's question: What is man?
                    with the words: A mammal. And in the same spirit De Maistre repeatedly asserts
                    that the whole science of chemistry requires to be placed on a different, a
                    religious basis, or declares his conviction that some honest scientist will
                    certainly succeed in proving that it is not the moon, but God, who produces the
                    ebb and flow of the tide, as also that water, which is an element, cannot be
                    resolved into oxygen and hydrogen. He is of opinion that birds are a living
                    proof of the incorrectness of the law of gravitation. In this connection one of
                    the characters in his <emph>Soirées de St. Pétersbourg</emph> remarks that there is more of
                    the supernatural in birds than in other animals, a fact witnessed to by the
                    signal honour shown them in the choice of the dove to represent the Holy Spirit.
                    That alligators should lay eggs, that birds should fly–such feats are miracles
                    in the eyes of the Neo-Catholics.</p>

                <p>On the dogmatic part of the work follows the æsthetic, which is the more
                    important. In it Chateaubriand endeavours to prove that »of all the religions
                    which have ever existed, the Christian religion is the most poetical, the most
                    human, the most favourable to freedom, to art, and to literature–that to it the
                    modern world owes everything, from agriculture to the abstract sciences, from
                    asylums for the unfortunate to churches built by Michael Angelo and ornamented
                    by Raphael–that there is nothing more divine than its morality, nothing more
                    beautiful and noble than its dogmas and its rites–that it favours genius,
                    purifies taste, approves and stimulates virtuous passion, invigorates thought,
                    provides poets and artists with the noblest themes, &amp;c., &amp;c.«</p>

                <p>For two hundred years the great dispute had been going on as to the comparative
                    superiority of the works of ancient and modern literature. It had occupied the
                    minds of Corneille and Racine; it had produced the earliest translations of
                    Greek and Roman poetry; and it had by slow degrees led the modern mind to
                    recover its self-confidence, after the <pb n="85"/> first overpowering impression of the
                    grandeur of ancient literature had worn off. It was this two hundred years' long
                    discussion which Chateaubriand revived in a new form, namely, as the question of
                    the value of the Christian religion to poetry and the arts, compared with that
                    of the old mythologies. In the most remarkable manner he ignores the fact that
                    the great question in the case of a religion is not whether or in what degree it
                    is poetical, but whether it has the truth on its side or not. Very remarkable,
                    too, are the arguments to which he has recourse to support his assertions! He
                    vaunts, for example, the æsthetic superiority of the Christian hell to the
                    heathen Tartarus. Is it not infinitely grander–»poetry of torture, hymns of
                    flesh and blood«?</p>

                <p>He poetically jingles hell's instruments of torture, employs them as æsthetic
                    rattles for the old, dull children of the new century, and brings into fashion a
                    sort of drawing-room Christianity, specially adapted to the requirements of the<emph>
                    blasés</emph> upper classes of France. In the seventeenth century men believed in
                    Christianity, in the eighteenth they renounced and extirpated it, and now, in
                    the nineteenth, the kind of piety was coming into vogue which consisted in
                    looking at it pathetically, gazing at it from the outside, as one looks at an
                    object in a museum, and saying: How poetic! how touching! how beautiful!
                    Fragments from the ruins of monasteries were set up in gardens, with a figure
                    dressed as a hermit guarding them; a gold cross was once more thought a most
                    becoming ornament for a fashionable lady; the audiences at sacred concerts
                    melted into tears. Men were touched by the thought of all the comfort religion
                    affords to the poor and the suffering. They had lost the simple faith of olden
                    days and now clung to externals, to the significance of the Catholic church in
                    literature and art, its influence on society and the state. To make the
                    antiquated principle of authority look young and attractive they painted it with
                    the rouge of sentimental enthusiasm; but they only succeeded in making the
                    principle that had once been so awe-inspiring, ridiculous.</p>

                <p>Constant wrote his book on religion in the house of his friend, Madame de
                    Charrière, Chateaubriand wrote his in the companionship of his devoted and
                    intimate friend, Madame <pb n="86"/> de Beaumont, who assisted him by searching for the
                    quotations he required. His mind does not seem to have been taken up with his
                    work to the exclusion of all mundane thoughts.</p>

                <p>We know how grandiloquently Chateaubriand inveighed during Louis XVIII.'s reign
                    against the married priests, in what a bitter spirit he stirred up the royalist
                    and church party against them, how determined he was that they should be
                    deprived of every sou of their pay, to punish them for having taken advantage of
                    the laws of the Republic to marry like other citizens. Yet was not he himself,
                    as the author of <emph>Le Génie du Christianisme</emph> (in the preface to which he writes
                    of himself as »the humble Lévite«), a kind of priest, nay, more than a common
                    priest? And was not he married, and that, too, without the aid of a priest? I
                    draw attention to this because it is one of the thousand signs of something that
                    is to be detected everywhere throughout this religious reaction, something to
                    which I believe we are justified in applying, ugly as it is, the word
                    »hypocrisy.«</p>

                <p>Such, then, is Chateaubriand's book, and such are the circumstances in which it
                    came into being. To its unprecedented success and enormous influence it owes an
                    importance greater than its proper due. It was the book of the moment; it
                    smuggled in, well packed in sentimentality, that principle of authority which
                    was soon to ascend the throne.</p>

                <head><pb n="[87]"/> V. JOSEPH DE MAISTRE</head>

                <p>The ascension was brought about by a man of a very different stamp.</p>

                <p>Count Joseph de Maistre was born at Chambéry in Savoy in 1754. The De Maistre
                    family, which belonged to the highest class of the bureaucracy, had immigrated
                    from France at the beginning of the seventeenth century. In the boy's home his
                    father's severe, imperious spirit, with its strong tone of old-fashioned piety,
                    ruled supreme. Joseph, who was the eldest of ten children, was trained in such
                    absolute obedience that even when he was at the University of Turin he never
                    allowed himself to read a book without first writing to ask his father's
                    permission. From a very early age he was devoted to serious study. He learned
                    seven languages, which is an uncommon thing for a Frenchman to do even now, and
                    was more uncommon then. He entered the civil service, became, like his father
                    before him, a magistrate in his native town and a senator, and married at the
                    age of thirty-two.</p>

                <p>Two children had been born to him when the French Revolution broke out and made a
                    complete change in his life. Savoy was incorporated with France, and to remain
                    faithful to his king Joseph de Maistre gave up his home; he had to choose
                    between becoming a citizen of the French Republic and having all his property
                    confiscated, and he chose without hesitation. For a few years he lived in
                    Switzerland. Here he wrote his first work, <emph>Considérations sur la France</emph>
                    (published anonymously in London in 1797), and made the acquaintance of Madame
                    de Staël. Though he considered that her head had been turned by modern
                    philosophy (in his opinion an inevitable consequence in the <pb n="88"/> case of any woman),
                    he acknowledged her to be »astonishingly brilliant, especially when she was not
                    trying to be so.« They bickered and wrangled, but were none the less good
                    friends.</p>

                <p>In 1797, when the King of Sardinia was obliged to leave his continental
                    territories and take refuge on his rocky island, Count de Maistre happened to be
                    in Turin. He fled to Venice, arriving after many hairbreadth escapes, and there
                    he and his family suffered great privations. From 1800 to 1802, as chief
                    magistrate of Sardinia, he laboured hard to improve the slovenly administration
                    of justice which he found prevailing there. In 1802 the deserted king sent him
                    as envoy-extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to St. Petersburg. His
                    acceptance of this appointment obliged him to part from his wife and children,
                    to whom he was tenderly attached. The pay was so miserable that it barely
                    sufficed to cover his own necessary expenses–he could not afford to provide
                    himself with a fur-lined coat. But in Russia, now passing through the most
                    prosperous period of the reign of Alexander I, De Maistre's capacities found
                    scope for development, and this poor ambassador of a petty power succeeded in
                    winning the Emperor's entire confidence. The strength and purity of his
                    character, his pronounced royalist and conservative views, his knowledge, his
                    sagacity, and his wit ensured him a prominent place at a court whose sovereign
                    knew how to appreciate both an uncommon character and remarkable talent.</p>

                <p>Although by birth a Piedmontese, and as a diplomatist to a certain extent a
                    cosmopolitan, Joseph de Maistre belongs by his language–and not by that
                    alone–to French literature. All his literary theories were French, and there
                    was much that was French in his intellectual idiosyncrasy. Not only was France
                    always in his eyes the chief power in Europe, and the King of France, as »the
                    most Christian king,« the main bulwark of monarchy and Christianity, but he was
                    at heart on the side of France even when it was for his ideas that her enemies
                    were waging war upon her. In spite of everything he rejoiced when Republican
                    France defeated the army of the allied monarchs. For what they<!-- Illustration: [DE MAISTRE] --> <pb n="89"/> desired was the
                    division of France, the annihilation of its power. »But our descendants, who
                    will think with indifference of our sufferings and dance upon our graves, will
                    make very light of the excesses which we have witnessed and which have preserved
                    undivided the most delectable kingdom after that of heaven.« He desires the
                    defeat of the Jacobins, but not the ruin of France, which would be equivalent to
                    the inevitable intellectual relapse of the human race.</p>

           

                <p>In a manner he felt himself to be a Frenchman. All his life long he proclaims,
                    and by his actions proves, himself to be the loyal subject and servant of the
                    King of Sardinia; but, when he is more than usually ill rewarded for his
                    services, the thought strikes him that it was really by a kind of mistake of
                    nature that he was not born a Frenchman. We read in one of his letters
                    (<emph>Correspondance diplomatique</emph>, i. 197): »I cannot get rid of the feeling that,
                    let me do what I will, I am not the man to suit His Majesty. Sometimes in my
                    poetic day-dreams I imagine that nature, carrying me in her apron from Nice to
                    France, tripped on the Alps (a very excusable thing in an old lady) and let me
                    fall into Chambéry. She ought by rights to have gone straight to Paris, or at
                    any rate to have stopped at Turin, where I could have developed properly; but on
                    the 1st of April 1754 the irreparable mistake was made. I discover in myself a
                    certain Gallican element, for which, be it observed, I have all due respect.«
                    Thus it is not merely permissible but obligatory to set De Maistre's name first
                    on the list of the men who brought about the powerful reaction in France against
                    the fundamental ideas of the eighteenth century.</p>

                <p>His first book, written in 1796, already shows the character of the reaction to
                    which he gives expression, and which he endows with stubborn consistency. While
                    the Revolution is still proceeding, but at the moment when the
                    counter-revolution is beginning to make its influence felt, he eagerly
                    vindicates the two powers which the century had repudiated–belief in the
                    supernatural and fidelity to political tradition.</p>

                <p><pb n="90"/> Maintaining that every nation, like every individual, has its mission to fulfil,
                    he declares that France has guiltily abused the position of authority given to
                    her in Europe. She stood at the head of the religious system, and not without
                    reason were her kings called »the most Christian.« As she has used her power to
                    act in direct contradiction to her mission, it can surprise no one that she is
                    being brought back to the right path by terrible chastisements. The French
                    Revolution is marked by <emph>Satanic</emph> traits, which distinguish it from anything
                    ever seen before and possibly from anything that will ever be seen again. Its
                    so-called legislators have issued such a proclamation as this: »The nation
                    supports no religion,« words which would almost seem to indicate hatred of the
                    Divine Being.</p>

                <p>Even Rousseau, though he was »the most mistaken of men,« perceived that it was
                    only a narrow-minded and arrogant philosophy which could suppose the founders of
                    such religions as the Jewish and the Mahometan to be nothing but lucky
                    impostors. Philosophy is a disintegrating, religion alone an organising power.
                    But no religion in the world can be compared with Christianity. It alone,
                    although it is founded upon supernatural facts and is a revelation of
                    incomprehensible dogmas, has been believed for eighteen centuries and been
                    defended by the greatest men of all ages, from Origen to Pascal. Now it has been
                    dethroned and its altars have been overturned. Philosophy reigns triumphant. But
                    if Christianity issues from this ordeal purer and stronger than ever–then,
                    Frenchmen, make way for the most Christian king, place him on his ancient
                    throne, lift high his flaming banner (<emph>oriflamme</emph>), and proclaim that Christ
                    commands, guides, and conquers!</p>

                <p>There is no government but theocracy (priestly rule), and every constitution
                    comes from God. A constitution is never the result of a contract, and the laws
                    which rule the nations are never written laws, for those constitutions which are
                    written are never anything but proclamations of older laws, of which all that
                    can be said is that they exist because they exist. The constitution of 1795 is,
                    like earlier revolutionary <pb n="91"/> constitutions, made for <emph>man</emph>. But there is not such
                    a thing as <emph>man</emph>: »In the course of my life I have seen Frenchmen, Italians,
                    Russians, &amp;c.; I know, too, thanks to Montesquieu, that there are Persians;
                    but <emph>man</emph> I have never met; if he exists, it is contrary to my knowledge.« No;
                    when the population, the customs, the religion, the geographical position, the
                    existing political conditions, the good and bad qualities of a nation are known,
                    then a constitution is the solution to the problem of finding the laws suitable
                    for that particular nation.</p>

                <p>De Maistre traces the probable course of the counter-revolution. He sagaciously
                    demonstrates the unreasonableness of the supposition that it can only be the
                    outcome of the will of the people. Very possibly a minority of four or five
                    persons, he says, will give France a king. Letters from Paris will announce to
                    the provinces that the country has a king, and the provinces will shout: <emph>Vive
                    le roi!</emph> With his obstinate faith in providence he foretells the restoration
                    (even in its details) at a time when all hopes of such an event seemed indeed to
                    be built upon sand, and in process of so doing exhibits a fascinating
                    combination of excessive enthusiasm for the pre-revolutionary conditions with a
                    practical political sagacity which avoids any overstraining of principle that
                    would make the restoration of these conditions impossible. On the delicate
                    question, whether or not the restoration of the monarchy will entail the return
                    of the national property to its original owners, he expresses himself with a
                    caution which is strikingly at variance with the generally confident, defiant
                    tone of the book. He explains that a revolutionary government is, by its very
                    nature, an unsteady government. Under it nothing is certain. As the ownership of
                    national property is not yet, in the opinion of the general public, free from
                    the reproach originally attaching to it, a government which considered itself in
                    no way debarred from undoing what it had done would in all probability lay hands
                    on this property as soon as it could. »But under a steady, permanent government
                    everything is permanent, so that even for the acquirers of national property <pb n="92"/> it
                    is important that the monarchy should be restored; they will then know what they
                    have to rely upon.« In other words, he has at least so much regard for actual
                    circumstances as to acknowledge that it will not be possible to reign after the
                    Revolution in exactly the same manner as before it.</p>

                <p>His fundamental political doctrine is that the state is an organism, that as an
                    organism it possesses real unity, and lives its life by virtue of a far-off
                    past, from which it refreshes itself as from a perennial source, and by virtue
                    of an inward, secret fountain of life. It is not the outcome of discussion and
                    arrangement, but of an unfathomable mystery. Hence a written constitution
                    signifies nothing. It is the soul of the nation which gives the nation unity and
                    permanence, and this soul is the love of the nation for itself and its national
                    memories. France is not thirty millions of human beings living between the
                    Pyrenees and the Rhine, but a thousand millions who have lived there. Our
                    country is nought else but the unity of those who live, those who have lived,
                    and those who will live in the days to come on the same fragment of the earth's
                    surface. The fact that one family is the symbol of the continued existence of
                    this nation leads De Maistre to monarchy.</p>

                <p>Sovereignty cannot be divided. Therefore the king does not share his power with
                    the great of the land. These latter have no privileges, but they have duties.
                    They form the king's council; they are guardians of the national unity, inasmuch
                    as they unite the people to the throne, and guardians of the national
                    continuity, inasmuch as they are the sustainers of tradition. It is their duty
                    perpetually to proclaim to the people the benefit of authority, and to the king
                    the benefits of liberty. The law is, as law, the same for all, therefore
                    destitute of the pliability which is a necessity if freedom is to be granted and
                    ensured. An enlightened autocracy secures liberty.</p>

                <p>When Bonaparte appears and quickly develops into Napoleon, Joseph de Maistre is,
                    naturally, his implacable enemy. Nevertheless, he recognises the autocrat in
                    him. He feels that the unity of the French nation is embodied <pb n="93"/> in him, and this
                    though he regards him as the <emph>demonium meridianum</emph> (see <emph>Correspondance
                    diplomatique</emph>, ii. 65). In July 1807 he writes: »In those newspapers which are
                    his organs Bonaparte causes himself to be called the messenger of God. Nothing
                    could be truer. Bonaparte comes straight from heaven ... as lightning does.« In
                    other words, De Maistre saw in the calamities which Napoleon brought upon
                    Europe, as in all »heaven-sent« calamities, judgments, the justice of which did
                    not diminish the guilt of those who executed them. In 1808, out of love for his
                    country, he did violence to his own inclinations by endeavouring to obtain an
                    audience of Napoleon for the purpose of pleading the cause of Sardinia. He took
                    this step not in his capacity of minister, but privately and on his own
                    responsibility. Napoleon, though he did not answer De Maistre's letter (written
                    from St. Petersburg), was evidently impressed by the quality of the man; he
                    ordered the French ambassador at the Russian court to show him favour, and did
                    not take his audacity at all amiss. De Maistre's own court, however, did. It was
                    intimated to him that the Cabinet, to which he had sent immediate notice of the
                    measure taken, had been disagreeably surprised by it. He replies proudly and
                    satirically: »The Cabinet has been surprised! The skies may fall–that is a
                    matter of no consequence–but heaven preserve us from an unexpected idea! I am
                    now more than ever persuaded that I am not the man you want. I can promise you
                    to transact His Majesty's affairs as well as any man, but I cannot promise never
                    to surprise you. That is a weakness in my character which I am incapable of
                    curing.« He proved the truth of what he himself somewhere says, that trusting to
                    the constancy of court favour is »like lying down on the wing of a windmill to
                    sleep soundly.« When vindicating himself he writes: »I know everything that can
                    be said against Bonaparte; he is a <emph>usurper</emph>, he is a <emph>murderer</emph>; but note well
                    that he is less of a usurper than William of Orange and less of a murderer than
                    Elizabeth of England. ... As yet we are not stronger than God, and we must come
                    to terms with him to whom it has pleased God to entrust the power« (<emph>Lettres et
                    opuscules</emph>, i. 114.)</p>

                <p><pb n="94"/> Joseph de Maistre spent fourteen years of his life as envoy at St. Petersburg.
                    The long separation from the female members of his family was very painful to
                    him, and the cares of a father often weighed heavily on his mind. It is touching
                    to read in one of his letters that when he was lying awake at night, over-tired
                    with work, he often imagined that he heard his youngest little daughter, whom he
                    did not know, crying in Turin.</p>

                <p>As a proof of his favour and esteem for De Maistre, the Czar gave commissions in
                    the Russian army to his brother and son. The brother was wounded during the
                    campaign in the Caucasus. The son fought in the war against Napoleon. »No one,«
                    writes the father, »knows what war is unless he has a son fighting. I do what I
                    can to banish the thoughts of hewn-off arms and smashed skulls that constantly
                    torment me; then I sup like a youth, sleep like a child, and awake like a man,
                    that is to say, early.«</p>

                <p>The great panegyrist of the executioner and the <emph>auto da fé</emph> had in private life
                    a very tender heart. His private utterances often convey the impression of
                    kindliness, as his public do of whimsical wit.</p>

                <p>He perhaps shows most amiably in his letters to his daughter: »You ask me, dear
                    child, why it is that women are condemned to mediocrity. They are not. They may
                    become great, but it must be in a feminine way. Every creature ought to keep to
                    its own place and not strive after advantages other than those which properly
                    belong to it. I have a dog called Biribi, who is a great amusement to us all; if
                    he were to take it into his head to have himself saddled and bridled to carry me
                    out into the country, I should be as little pleased with him as with your
                    brother's English mare if she were to take it into her head to jump on my knee
                    or to sit down at the breakfast-table with me. The mistakes some women make come
                    from their imagining that in order to rise above the common level they must act
                    like men.... If twenty years ago a pretty woman had asked me: 'Do you not
                    believe that a woman is just as capable of being a great general as a man?' I
                    should have answered: 'Most undoubtedly I do, Madam. If you com<pb n="95"/>manded an army,
                    the enemy would fall on their knees to you as I do now, and you would enter
                    their capital with drums beating and banners flying.' If she had said to me:
                    'What is there to prevent my knowing as much of astronomy as Newton?' I should
                    have replied with equal sincerity: 'Nothing whatever, O peerless beauty! You
                    have but to look through the telescope, and the stars will consider it an honour
                    to be gazed at by your beautiful eyes, and will hasten to discover all their
                    mysteries to you.' These are the things we say to women, both in prose and
                    verse; but the woman who takes such speeches seriously is uncommonly stupid.«
                    After declaring that woman's mission is to bear and to bring up men, he adds:
                    »But, dear child, I am for moderation in everything. I believe, speaking
                    generally, that women ought not to aim at acquirements which are at variance
                    with their duties, but I am far from thinking that they ought to be perfectly
                    ignorant. I do not wish them to believe that Pekin is in France, or that
                    Alexander the Great proposed marriage to a daughter of Louis XIV.« And in a
                    following letter he writes: »I see that you are angry with me for my impertinent
                    attack on learned women. It is absolutely necessary that we should make friends
                    again before Easter. The fact that you have misunderstood me ought to make the
                    process easy. I never said that women were monkeys; I swear to you by all that
                    is most holy that I have always thought them incomparably more beautiful, more
                    amiable, and more useful; but I did say, and this I abide by, that the women who
                    want to be men are monkeys; for wanting to be learned is wanting to be a man. I
                    think that the Holy Spirit has shown His wisdom in arranging things as they are,
                    sad as it may seem. I make my humble obeisance to the young lady you tell me of,
                    who is writing an epic poem, but heaven preserve me from becoming her husband; I
                    should live in terror of seeing her delivered in my house of a tragedy, or
                    possibly even of a farce–for when talent has once set off, there is no knowing
                    where it will stop.«</p>

                <p>»The best and most convincing observation in your letter is that upon the raw
                    material employed in the creation <pb n="96"/> of man. Strictly speaking, it is only man who
                    is made of dust and ashes, or, not to mince matters, of dirt, whereas woman was
                    made of a mire that had already been prepared and elevated to the dignity of a
                    rib. <emph>Corpo di Bacco! questo vuol dir molto</emph>. You cannot say too much, my dear
                    child, as far as I am concerned, about the nobility of women, even those of the
                    bourgeois class; to a man there should be nothing more excellent than a woman,
                    just as to a woman, &amp;c, &amp;c.... But it is precisely because of the
                    exalted opinion I have of these noble ribs that I become seriously angry when I
                    see any of them desiring to transform themselves into original mire. And now it
                    seems to me that the question is completely disposed of.« (<emph>Lettres et
                    opuscules</emph>, i. 145, 156).</p>

                <p>It surprises us to find the strictly orthodox Catholic jesting thus lightly with
                    Bible legend; but even in his witty and sportive moods De Maistre is faithful to
                    his reactionary principles. It is one of his characteristics that a certain
                    piquant wit goes hand in hand with the violent, dæmonic energy of his attack, an
                    energy which reveals itself even in the little fact that his favourite
                    expression is <emph>à brûle-pourpoint</emph> (in its literal meaning–to fire with the
                    muzzle of one's pistol upon one's antagonist's coat).</p>

                <p>In the <emph>Soirées de St. Pétersbourg</emph>, in which he already writes of Bacon with
                    some of that animosity to which he afterwards gave full vent in a large and
                    erudite work, he makes a humorous observation which is quite in accord with the
                    newest scientific view of the matter: »Bacon was a barometer that announced fine
                    weather, and because he announced it, men believed that it was he who had
                    produced it.« And in a letter he writes: »I cannot tell how there came to be
                    this war to the death between me and the late Lord Chancellor Bacon. We have
                    boxed like two Fleet Street boxers, and if he has pulled out some of my hair, I
                    imagine that his wig no longer sits very straight on his head.«</p>

                <p>When De Maistre is broaching his favourite theories, his humour is often very
                    sarcastic, as, for instance, when he discourses, in the second part of the
                    <emph>Soirées</emph>, on the ways of maintaining <emph>esprit de corps</emph>. There is much cynicism
                    in such <pb n="97"/> pleasantry as this: »To produce discipline and the feeling of honour in
                    any corps or society, special rewards are of less avail than special
                    punishments.« He shows how the idea had occurred to the Romans of making
                    military punishment a privilege–only soldiers had the right to be beaten with
                    rods made of the wood of the vine. No man who was not a soldier might be beaten
                    with such a rod, and no other kind of rod might be used to flog a soldier with.
                    »I cannot understand how some such idea has not occurred to any of our modern
                    rulers. If I were asked for advice on the subject, I should not go back to the
                    vine rod, for slavish imitation is useless. I should suggest laurel rods.« He
                    further proposes that a great forcing-house should be erected in the capital,
                    exclusively for the purpose of producing the necessary supply of laurel branches
                    with which the non-commissioned officers are to belabour the backs of the
                    Russian army. This forcing-house is to be under the supervision of a general,
                    who must also be a Knight of St. George of the Second Class, at lowest, and
                    whose title is to be »Chief Inspector of the Laurel Forcing-House«; the trees
                    are to be attended to by old pensioners of unblemished character; models of the
                    rods, which must all be exactly alike, are to be kept in a red case at the War
                    Office; each non-commissioned officer is to carry one hanging by a ribbon of St.
                    George from his button-hole; and on the façade of the forcing-house is to be
                    inscribed: This is <emph>my</emph> tree, which brings forth <emph>my</emph> leaves.</p>

                <p>De Maistre lived at St. Petersburg in great poverty, which he bore without being
                    humiliated by it. He was distrusted and constantly left in the lurch by his
                    ungrateful court, which did not even repay him the sums that from time to time
                    he was obliged to advance out of his slender means to necessitous
                    fellow-countrymen in Russia. During these years his theories matured and his
                    intellectual idiosyncrasies became more marked. The letters, private as well as
                    diplomatic, which he wrote at this time give us an excellent idea of the spirit
                    and the general conditions prevailing at the court of Alexander I. Those written
                    previous to and during Napoleon's campaign in Russia are especially interesting
                    from the graphic impression they give <pb n="98"/> of the fears, hopes, panics, and
                    rejoicings produced at that time throughout the Russian empire by war news,
                    whether true or false. At first De Maistre is in great anxiety about the issue
                    of the war. He clearly sees the incompetence of the generals who are appointed
                    to direct the operations against such a leader as the Emperor of the French. But
                    from the moment when it is known how ill-equipped the French army is to face the
                    Russian autumn, not to mention the Russian winter, he is no longer in doubt; he
                    foresees that Napoleon's fall and the restitution of all his conquests–events
                    which he had long regarded as certain to happen sooner or later–are close at
                    hand.</p>

                <p>Six of De Maistre's works were written at St. Petersburg. Of these <emph>Du Pape, De
                    l'Église Gallicane, Examen de la Philosophie de Bacon</emph>, and <emph>Soirées de St.
                    Pétersbourg</emph> are the most important and the most characteristic of their
                    author.</p>

                <p>The <emph>Soirées</emph> contain the ideas on the subject of God and the world upon which
                    his theory of the state is based. Anticipating the objection that the authority
                    of his absolute monarchs rests upon no foundation, that they are utterly
                    irresponsible, that, in other words, autocracy is unjust, he meets it with the
                    preliminary general answer that injustice is the law of every society, because
                    it is the law of all life on earth. In nature itself might is right–with the
                    right of the stronger, plants and animals are perpetually destroying one
                    another. And this law: Might is right, is far from losing its validity in the
                    world of man; here also it prevails, as the law of war. War is a perpetually
                    recurring phenomenon in the life of the human race. Except for a few years in
                    each century, it has raged from the most ancient times until now, and it will
                    continue to do so. Human blood will always be flowing upon earth. For the
                    chastisement of heaven is upon man. To this conception of war the military
                    profession owes the high position it holds and always has held. No trade is
                    considered so honourable as that of the soldier. The human race, taken as a
                    whole, is guilty and deserves the scourge of war, unjustly though the punishment
                    may fall in single cases.</p>

                <p><pb n="99"/> It is, then, as the representative of God upon earth that the autocrat is, in the
                    first place, the war-lord, in the second, the possessor of the divine and
                    terrible prerogative of <emph>punishing the guilty</emph>. This prerogative necessarily
                    entails the existence of a man whose profession it is to execute the punishments
                    ordained by human justice. And such a man is always to be found–a strange and
                    inexplicable fact, for our reason is at a loss to discover any motive which can
                    lead a man to choose such a profession. Hence the character who is the
                    mouthpiece of De Maistre's own opinions is inspired with a feeling of awe and
                    reverence by the much misjudged executioner.</p>

                <p>According to the general, and, in De Maistre's opinion, entirely justifiable
                    verdict, every soldier, simply as such, is so noble that he ennobles even those
                    actions which are generally regarded as the most degrading; he may exercise the
                    calling of the executioner without suffering the slightest degradation, so long
                    as he only carries out the sentence of death upon members of his own profession
                    and uses no other instruments for the purpose but its weapons. It is not without
                    its significance that on every page of the Old Testament shines the name, the
                    Lord of Hosts. No action is more inseparably connected in men's minds with
                    honour than the innocent shedding of innocent blood. It is in the very passion
                    of carnage that De Maistre admires the soldier most. Such a thing has never been
                    known as an army refusing to fight. It is an irresistible impulse that drives
                    men onward into battle. And why is this so? In order that to the end of time
                    there may be fulfilled that law of the violent destruction of living beings
                    which extends throughout creation, from the lowest animal to man.</p>

                <p>But although from time immemorial there has been no calling more honourable than
                    that which involves the shedding of innocent blood, a remarkable prejudice has
                    caused the calling of the executioner to be as much disdained as the soldier's
                    is respected.</p>

                <p>De Maistre inquires if this man who, in preference to all profitable and
                    honourable callings, has chosen that of torturing and killing his fellow-men, is
                    not really a being of <pb n="100"/> some peculiar and higher kind. And in his dialogues the
                    Count, who is his own mouthpiece, answers:–</p>

                <p>»I myself have no doubt on the subject. Outwardly, he is formed like ourselves;
                    but he is an abnormal being, and it is only a special act of creative power
                    which can add such a member to the human family. He is like a world in himself.
                    All shun him; his house stands in a desert place, every one withdrawing as far
                    as possible from the spot where he lives with his mate and his young ones, whose
                    voices are the only cheerful human sounds that fall upon his ear; but for them
                    he would hear nothing but shrieks of agony.... A sinister signal is given. One
                    of the lowest menials of justice knocks at his door and informs him that his
                    services are required; he sets off; he arrives at a public place where human
                    beings are crowding together in excited expectancy. A prisoner–a parricide, a
                    committer of sacrilege–is flung at his feet; he seizes this man, binds him to a
                    cross which is lying on the ground, then raises his arm–the terrible silence
                    that follows is only broken by the sound of the crashing of bones under the
                    blows of the iron mace and the screams of the victim. He unbinds the man; he
                    carries him to the wheel; the broken limbs are twined round its spokes, the head
                    hangs down, the hair stands on end, and from the mouth, open like the opening of
                    a glowing furnace, there come at intervals a few broken syllables of entreaty
                    for death.–He has finished his task; his heart is beating, but it is with
                    pleasure; he is satisfied with his work; he says in his heart: No man breaks on
                    the wheel better than I. He comes down from the scaffold and holds out his
                    bloody hand, into which, from as great a distance as possible, the official
                    whose duty it is to pay him flings a few gold pieces, with which he marches off
                    between two rows of human beings who shrink from him with horror. He sits down
                    to table and eats; he goes to bed and sleeps; and when he awakes next morning
                    his thoughts run on everything but his occupation of the day before. Is he a
                    man? Yes. God allows him to enter His temples and accepts his prayer. He is no
                    criminal, and yet in no human language is he called honourable or
                    estimable.«</p>

                <p><pb n="101"/> »Nevertheless all greatness, all power, all order depend upon the executioner. He
                    is the terror of human society and the tie that holds it together. Take away
                    this incomprehensible force, and that very moment order is superseded by chaos,
                    thrones fall, and states disappear. God, who is the source of the power of the
                    ruler, is also the source of punishment; He has suspended our world upon these
                    two poles, for the Lord is the Lord of the poles, and round them He sets the
                    world revolving.«</p>

                <p>And in order that this reverence for the office of the executioner which it is in
                    keeping with his plan to inculcate, and which it entertains him to astound with,
                    may make a proper impression on the reader, De Maistre takes up the subject
                    again in one of the later conversations. He asks what a reasoning being coming
                    from another world to investigate into the conditions prevailing in ours would
                    think of the executioner, and himself gives the answer: »He is an august being,
                    the corner-stone of society. Since crime has undoubtedly taken up its abode upon
                    earth, and since it can only be kept in check by punishment, it is plain that,
                    if the executioner disappeared, all order would disappear with him. And what
                    greatness of soul, what noble disinterestedness must we presume that man to be
                    possessed of who takes upon himself the execution of a task which, though
                    certainly a very honourable one, is most painful and repugnant to human nature,
                    &amp;c.«</p>

                <p>In these utterances we have at one and the same time the delight in consistency
                    which is to be observed in the earliest nineteenth-century devotees of the
                    principle of authority, the delight in a disconcerting idea which is one of De
                    Maistre's own chief mental characteristics, and the delight in describing
                    suffering which he has in common with Görres and so many of the other champions
                    of the gloomy doctrine of the necessary subjection of humanity to kings and
                    priests.</p>

                <p>De Maistre resents hearing men so often talk as if crime went unpunished. What do
                    they mean by this? »For whom are the gallows, the knout, the wheel, and the
                    stake and fagot provided? Surely for the criminal.« Justice <pb n="102"/> may sometimes
                    miscarry, but such exceptions do not alter the rule. It is folly to believe in
                    all the judicial murders one hears talked about. Take the frequently quoted case
                    of Calas. Nothing is more doubtful than his innocence.</p>

                <p>The very fact that Voltaire defended him speaks against it.</p>

                <p>But given the worst–that an innocent man is deprived of his life–why, it is
                    simply a misfortune like any other. When a guilty man escapes we have another
                    exception and misfortune of the same kind. The events which lead to the
                    discovery of a crime are, however, often so unexpected and improbable that we
                    cannot but believe that human justice is supported by higher aid. And all the
                    time that we are foolishly blaming human justice for having punished an innocent
                    man, nothing is more probable than that he really is guilty, though of some
                    other, unknown crime. Many such cases are on record, the truth coming to light
                    through the confession of the criminals. De Maistre, we observe, understands how
                    to extricate himself from a difficulty.</p>

                <p>Something of the same nature holds good in the matter of sickness. Its injustice,
                    too, is only apparent. If every kind of intemperance could be prevented, most,
                    nay, in reality all diseases would be done away with. This inference may be
                    arrived at by arguing as follows: If there were no moral evil in the world there
                    would be no physical evil, and since an infinite number of diseases are direct
                    consequences of certain offences, it is permissible to generalise and say that
                    this holds good of them all.</p>

                <p>Everything, then, is ordered upon moral principles. It is undeniable that life is
                    a terrible thing, but this does not prove that God is unjust; he is offended, he
                    is insulted, and to appease his anger blood is required. Man early comprehended
                    his own fall, early understood that it is the innocent who must and alone can,
                    by the transference of merit, atone for the sins of the guilty, that there is no
                    salvation without the shedding of sacrificial blood.</p>

                <p>Hence the idea of sacrifice is one of perpetual and keen interest to De Maistre.
                    Sacrifice is ideal slaughter, slaughter the one and only aim of which is the
                    accomplishment of <pb n="103"/> what is right and meet. From the earliest ages men have
                    offered both animal and human sacrifices; and in Christianity the practice is
                    sanctified and acquires a deeper meaning. Here it is not any chance and possibly
                    guilty individual who is the victim, but a being who is elected to die because
                    of his innocence. This, therefore, is ideal sacrifice.</p>

                <p>All this is undoubtedly an offence to reason. But contrariety to reason is the
                    sign and seal of truth. The theory which is the most obviously reasonable is the
                    theory which never stands the test of practice. Nothing could be more obviously
                    reasonable than the whole philosophy of the eighteenth century, with its faith
                    in man and its liberalism. But its very reasonableness bespeaks its
                    superficiality. It satisfies reason; but experience opens men's eyes to its
                    futility. Nothing seems more self-evident than that man is born free. Yet when
                    Rousseau writes: »Man is born free, nevertheless he is everywhere in fetters,«
                    he does not notice that he is not only writing nonsense, but distinctly
                    affirming that he is doing so. It would be quite as sensible to say; Sheep are
                    born carnivorous, nevertheless they everywhere live on vegetable food. In the
                    same way, nothing is theoretically more unreasonable than hereditary monarchy.
                    If, without any previous experience, men were called on to choose a government,
                    that man would be thought mad who hesitated to give an elective monarchy the
                    preference over a hereditary one. And yet we know from experience that the
                    latter is the best, the former the worst form of government. In other words, the
                    world, far from being a reasonable world, is full of things that are profoundly
                    at variance with reason.</p>

                <p>Christianity, the Christian conception of life, is therefore no new, hitherto
                    unknown conception. It is connected by many links with the whole succession of
                    heathen religions, and is prepared for by them. All the truths of Christianity
                    are foreshadowed in the creeds of heathendom. In heathen sacrificial practices,
                    for instance, we already have the essential idea of sacrifice. And De Maistre
                    waxes wroth over Voltaire's violent, irreligious tirades against <pb n="104"/> the sacrificial
                    festivals of the old pagans. He is yet more exasperated when, at the end of a
                    description of a sacrifice of both adults and children, he comes upon the words;
                    »However, the sacrifices of the Inquisition, of which we have so often spoken,
                    are a hundred times more execrable.«</p>

                <p>It is apropos of this utterance that (in his essay <emph>Éclaircissement sur les
                    sacrifices</emph>) De Maistre first takes up the cudgels for the Inquisition, to the
                    defence of which institution he was ere long to devote a special work. He
                    writes: »The passage relating to the Inquisition appears to have been written
                    during an attack of delirium. What! The lawful execution of a small number of
                    human beings, condemned to death by a fully qualified court of justice according
                    to the strict letter of a penal law which had previously been solemnly
                    proclaimed, and which each one of the victims was perfectly free to avoid
                    transgressing–to call such an execution a hundred times more abominable than
                    the horrible act of the parents who cast their children into the flaming arms of
                    Moloch! What wild insanity! What forgetfulness of all reason, all justice, all
                    shame!« De Maistre storms thus because he is here attacking the man who was his
                    opposite, and who fought, like himself, with the weapons of wit and paradox, but
                    wielded them with far greater power.</p>

                <p>Founding his theory of the state upon the basis of religion, De Maistre derived
                    the power of the ruler from God. It is from God that kings receive their rights,
                    and to God that they owe duty. It is not the king's power but his duty that is
                    absolute, for it is duty to the Absolute. The rights of the people may be called
                    the duty of the king to God. In the proverb: »The voice of the people is the
                    voice of God,« there is this truth, that the rights of the people are the rights
                    of God in His relation to the king. And »the voice of God« is not a mere figure
                    of speech; the living voice of God speaks through the church. The king is
                    responsible to God, and the church is the depositary of divine truth. But the
                    church, as well as the state, is under the rule of an autocrat. As the state
                    means the king, advised and guided by the great men of his <pb n="105"/> country, so the
                    church means the Pope, advised and guided by cardinals and bishops. The very
                    idea of sovereignty implies that the king is absolute, the Pope infallible.
                    People are not surprised that the captain of a ship should be, as such, an
                    infallible sovereign, should permit no criticism of his orders, should issue
                    unqualified commands and require them to be obeyed blindly; yet they are
                    surprised that in all church matters the Pope should be infallible. They are
                    accustomed to the idea that all the other courts of justice, low and high, are
                    submitted to the jurisdiction of a highest court, the judgments of which are
                    irreversible and may not be criticised; yet they are astonished that the Pope,
                    as head of the church, is infallible. If they had any conception of what
                    sovereignty means, they would not be astonished. A skilful attempt, this of De
                    Maistre's, to prove to laymen the reasonableness of ecclesiastical dogma.</p>

                <p>In his book <emph>Du Pape</emph>, which Catholics consider a work of the first importance,
                    he carries his reasoning on ecclesiastical matters to its logical
                    conclusion.</p>

                <p>This book was the outcome of the remorse he felt for having, at a trying moment,
                    forgotten the reverence due to the head of the church. When, three years after
                    the conclusion of the Concordat, the Pope went to Paris, at Napoleon's request,
                    to anoint and crown him Emperor, Joseph de Maistre, the ardent royalist, was so
                    incensed that in various letters to his court he used such language in writing
                    of the Holy Father that his <emph>Mémoires et correspondance diplomatique</emph> of these
                    years were published by Cavour in 1858 with the view of depriving the papal
                    power of a spiritual ally. In the course of a few years Napoleon and the Pope
                    quarrelled, and when De Maistre saw the Pope insulted and ill-used by the
                    Emperor, he repented his hasty words, and resolved to make ample reparation.</p>

                <p>The fundamental idea of <emph>Du Pape</emph> is that there is no human society without
                    government, no government without sovereignty, and no sovereignty without
                    infallibility. This attribute of infallibility is so indispensable that men are
                    obliged to assume its existence even in secular societies <pb n="106"/> (where it does not
                    exist) on pain of seeing these societies dissolved. The church lays claim to no
                    more than do the other authorities, although it has this immeasurable advantage
                    over them, that its infallibility is not only taken for granted by man, but also
                    guaranteed by God.</p>

                <p>De Maistre writes: »A great and powerful nation has lately, before our own eyes,
                    made the most strenuous efforts in the direction of liberty which the world has
                    ever beheld. What has it gained by these? It has covered itself with ridicule
                    and shame, and has ended by setting a Corsican gendarme on the throne of the
                    kings of France.« He shows how the Catholic religion necessarily forbids every
                    kind of revolt, whereas Protestantism, which is a result of the sovereignty of
                    the people, leaves the decision of everything to private feeling–a supposed
                    species of moral instinct. »There is such accordance, such a strong family
                    likeness, such interdependence between the papal and the kingly power that the
                    former has never been shaken without the latter suffering too.« As a proof of
                    this he quotes the following utterance of Luther: »Princes are as a rule the
                    greatest fools and the most arrant rogues on the face of the earth; nothing good
                    can be expected from them; they are God's executioners, whom He employs to
                    chastise us.« He avers that Protestantism, which has no reverence for royalty,
                    has no respect for marriage: »Had not Luther the audacity to write in his
                    exposition of the book of Genesis (1525) that the example of the patriarchs
                    leaves it an open question whether or not a man may have more than one wife,
                    that the thing is neither sanctioned nor forbidden, and that he, for his part,
                    will not take it upon him to decide one way or other?–edifying doctrine, of
                    which practical application was soon made in the family of the Landgrave of
                    Hesse-Cassel.« (Luther gave his consent to this prince having two wives at the
                    same time.)</p>

                <p>In opposition to Rousseau's doctrine De Maistre maintains that man is by nature a
                    slave, but that Christianity has, in a supernatural manner, emancipated him. For
                    this reason he calls the Christian woman a truly supernatural being. Voltaire he
                    without more ado calls the man »into <pb n="107"/> whose hands hell has given all its power.«
                    And he puts the crowning touch to his work by propounding the following theory:
                    »Monarchy is a <emph>miracle</emph>, and instead of reverencing it as such, we rail against
                    it as tyranny. The soldier who does not kill a man when commanded to do so by
                    his lawful sovereign is not less guilty than he who kills without having
                    received orders to do so.« Those states which have introduced Protestantism have
                    been punished by the loss of their monarchs. De Maistre has discovered that the
                    average length of reigns is shorter in Protestant than in Catholic countries.
                    The one inexplicable exception to this rule is provided by Denmark, which is the
                    only Protestant country whose sovereigns live as long after the Reformation as
                    before it. »Denmark appears, from some unknown reason, but doubtless one
                    honourable to the nation, to have been exempted from this law of the shortening
                    of reigns.«<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom"><emph>Du Pape</emph>, pp. 160, 174, 383.</note></p>

                <p>The fifth book of the earliest edition of <emph>Du Pape</emph> was afterwards published as a
                    separate work. It is the well-known <emph>De l'Église Gallicane</emph>, a treatise in which
                    De Maistre draws from the doctrine of papal authority conclusions utterly
                    subversive of the claim of the French church to relative independence. On this
                    occasion he assumes an antagonistic and supercilious attitude towards Bossuet, a
                    man for whom he generally has nothing but praise. The special object of his
                    attack and invective is the Church Council held in France in 1682 for the
                    purpose of strictly defining the limits of the Pope's power. He is almost as
                    much incensed against that of 1700, which pronounced Jesuits and Jansenists to
                    be equally blameworthy. It is to a life-long enthusiasm that De Maistre here
                    gives expression. From his youth he had been the devoted friend, admirer, and
                    supporter of the Jesuits. His diplomatic letters from Russia tell of his
                    constant endeavours to be of assistance to them in their difficult position as
                    Roman Catholics in a Greek Catholic country, of his anxiety to shield them when
                    the court is exasperated by their efforts to convert members of the aristocracy,
                    &amp;c, &amp;c. He now, as their champion, attacks Pascal. His attack is not
                    made <pb n="108"/> from the standpoint of philosophy, as it easily might have been, in so far
                    as their sensible apprehension of the fact that there can be no other morality
                    except morality of intention gives the Jesuits in certain ways the advantage
                    over the man of genius who impeached them. Nor is his defence of the Jesuits
                    conducted altogether from the standpoint of the man of the world, as it might
                    well have been, in so far as the Jesuits, with their modification of principles
                    and their practical indulgence, have followed the prudent rule that it is unwise
                    to alarm and better to have some of the moral law fulfilled by demanding little
                    than none by demanding all. He contents himself with maintaining that the Jesuit
                    treatises on morality attacked by Pascal are obsolete, unread books, which
                    Pascal dragged from their mouldy obscurity with the sole aim of insulting and
                    injuring an order, the strict morality and stern self-discipline of which even
                    its enemies had been forced to admit. Then, by way of variety taking up for a
                    moment the standpoint of the worldling, he remarks humorously: »It is, when we
                    come to think of it, very comical that we worldlings should take upon us to
                    inveigh against the <emph>lax morality</emph> of the Jesuits. This much is certain, that
                    the whole aspect of society would be changed if every member of it acted up even
                    to Escobar's moral standard, and were guilty of no shortcomings other than those
                    excused by him.«</p>

                <p>It was very natural that the energetic champion of the ideas of the past should,
                    towards the close of his career, make a special effort to clear the reputation
                    of the great, misunderstood, misjudged Inquisition. This he did in his <emph>Letters
                    to a Russian Nobleman on the Subject of the Spanish Inquisition</emph>. In these
                    letters De Maistre says everything that can be said in vindication and in honour
                    of the Inquisition; yet in reading them we are irresistibly reminded of the
                    remark of the old tiger in the <emph>Hitopadesa</emph>: »Nevertheless,« says the tiger,
                    »nevertheless, it is difficult to prove the falsehood of the report that tigers
                    eat men.« De Maistre shows that many of the assertions made of the Inquisition
                    are incorrect; he proves, for instance, that it was a secular, not an
                    ecclesiastical court of justice. But the only part <pb n="109"/> of the book that has any
                    attraction for us is that in which he defends its proceedings. He says: »In
                    Spain and Portugal, as elsewhere, every man who lives quietly is unmolested; as
                    to the rash person who attempts to teach others what to believe, or who disturbs
                    public order, he has only himself to blame.... The modern propagator of
                    heretical doctrine, haranguing at his ease in his own room, is quite untroubled
                    by the knowledge that Luther's line of argument produced the Thirty Years' War;
                    but the old legislators, who knew the price men might have to pay for these
                    fatal doctrines, most justly punished with death a crime which was capable of
                    shaking society to its foundations and bathing it in blood.... It is thanks to
                    the Inquisition that for the last three hundred years there has been more
                    happiness and peace in Spain than anywhere else in Europe.«</p>

                <p>To the <emph>Letters</emph> De Maistre has prefixed a quotation, which is to the effect that
                    all great men have been intolerant, and that it is right to be so. »Let him who
                    comes across a well-intentioned sovereign,« says Grimm, the Encyclopedist,
                    »preach tolerance in matters of faith to him, so that he may fall into the
                    snare, and, by his toleration, give the persecuted party time to recover and
                    prepare itself, when its turn of power comes, to crush its opponent. Voltaire's
                    discourse, with its babble of tolerance, is a discourse only for simpletons and
                    those who allow themselves to be fooled, or for people who have no interest in
                    the matter.«</p>

                <p>A gross fallacy conceals itself in this argument. Every genuine, overpowering
                    enthusiasm naturally makes tolerance impossible. Yet Voltaire's doctrine is none
                    the less valid because of this. The difficulty is easy of solution. The
                    principle of intolerance is the theoretical, that of tolerance the practical,
                    principle. In theory no consideration, no toleration, no mercy! For error must
                    be crushed and torn asunder, follies must be blown from the cannon's mouth, and
                    lies flayed alive. But what about the liar, and the fool, and the erring one?
                    Are they also to be hewn asunder, or flayed alive, or blown from the cannon's
                    mouth? They <pb n="110"/> are to go their way. The domain of real life is the domain of
                    tolerance.</p>

                <p>De Maistre's <emph>Examen de la philosophie de Bacon</emph> was not published until after
                    its author's death. It is the most disputatious and tedious of his works, and
                    one in which the combative champion of Christianity is plainly grappling with a
                    subject that is beyond his powers. He desired to confute Bacon because he
                    believed that the ungodliness of the French philosophy of the eighteenth century
                    was entirely to be ascribed to his influence; and he falls upon him with
                    positive theological fury, attacking all his theories–his theory of
                    consciousness, of nature, of light, of the weather, of the soul, of religion;
                    attacking him where he is right, and where, for once in a way, he is wrong;
                    finding him out in immaterial and merely superficial inconsistencies; pointing
                    out defects in his Latin and in his taste; fighting in a noisy, violent,
                    dogmatic manner, with weapons drawn from the arsenals of supernaturalism and
                    tradition. In single chapters, such as that on <emph>Causes Finales</emph>, he displays a
                    certain futile acuteness; in others, such as that entitled <emph>Union de la Religion
                    et de la Science</emph>, cold-blooded fanaticism. In this latter chapter we read:
                    »Science undoubtedly has its value, but it is necessary that it should be kept
                    within bounds.... It has been very aptly said that science resembles fire:
                    confined to the hearths which are destined to receive it, it is man's most
                    useful and powerful servant; left to the hazard of chance, it is a terrible
                    scourge.«</p>

                <p>Faithful to his rule of allowing no stain to cling to the shield or sword of the
                    church, he vehemently maintains (contradicting an assertion of Bacon's French
                    translator) that the church has never opposed the progress of natural science.
                    The translator had plainly affirmed that nothing had injured the church more
                    than the clear demonstration of the truth of certain facts which it had long
                    denied, and the proclaimers of which it had actually persecuted; and he had
                    named Galileo as an example. After lauding the church as the patron of science
                    in other cases, and trying as far as possible to explain away the case of
                    Galileo, De Maistre is <pb n="111"/> forced to make an admission. And this is how he does it:
                    »Galileo was condemned by the Inquisition, that is to say, by a court liable to
                    err like any other, and which in this case actually was mistaken regarding the
                    main point at issue; but Galileo in numberless ways damaged his own cause, and
                    by his own repeated indiscretions brought upon himself a humiliation which he
                    might easily, and without dishonour, have avoided.... If he had kept his promise
                    not to write, if he had not been determined to find proof in Holy Scripture of
                    the truth of the Copernican theory, if he had even written in Latin instead of
                    unsettling the public mind by employing the vulgar tongue, nothing would have
                    happened to him.«</p>

                <p>To the end De Maistre was true to his character; he would not yield a foot of the
                    ground that had been lost centuries before.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Joseph de Maistre, <emph>Considérations sur la France; Lettres et opuscules</emph>, i.,

                <p>He is a great and fascinating personality, this successful advocate of a lost
                    cause, which unmistakably gained ground during his lifetime. As the upholder of
                    authority, of monarchy, and of the gloomy view of life, as the disputant, as the
                    knight of Christianity, and as the scorner of science, he has a faint
                    resemblance to Kierkegaard. But his system is an edifice of ideas relating to
                    the outer, Kierkegaard's one of ideas relating to the inner, world.</p>

                <p>De Maistre is the thoroughly convinced and vehement, yet cold-hearted champion of
                    the principle of authority. There is heart in his letters, but there is none in
                    his books. In them there is nothing but heated argument, propounded with much
                    subtlety of logic and pungency of wit. In his sarcasm he often reminds us of
                    Voltaire, and his grim delight in horrors at times recalls Swift. It gives him
                    pleasure to astonish and to irritate. He loves paradox, because it makes him
                    feel his superiority, because it perplexes the reader, and because it makes
                    attack difficult, paradox being a redoubt which one can without dishonour
                    evacuate before the assault.</p>

                <p><pb n="112"/> His Christianity is an entirely external thing. He is a Christian as a man is a
                    Protectionist or a Free-trader, on grounds of general theoretical conviction.
                    His Christianity is a Christianity without brotherly love–nay, it is a
                    Christianity without Christ as saviour and reconciler. In it Christ is only the
                    sanguinary sacrifice demanded by the offended Deity–like Iphigenia or
                    Jephthah's daughter. Faguet has aptly said that De Maistre's Christianity is
                    »fear, passive obedience, and state religion.« It is a Christianity which does
                    not originate in Jerusalem, but in Rome; and he himself »is something in the
                    nature of an officer of the Pope's bodyguard.«</p>

                <p>The most ardent assailant of the spirit and philosophy of the eighteenth century,
                    the century in which he was born, has this in common with it, that he is
                    destitute of the proper apprehension of history. He would fain ignore the
                    eighteenth century, just as it was fain to ignore the Middle Ages. He is the
                    counterpart of the woman who represented the goddess of reason–he is the man
                    who represents the principle of authority pure and simple, without any
                    historical qualification. And at heart he is as devoid of religious feeling as
                    the century which he attacks in the name of revealed religion.</p>

                <p>Hard and cold, with a sarcastic and at times a cruel expression on his
                    countenance, but noble in character and strong of will, he stands at the
                    threshold of the new century like–if not the good, at least the best spirit of
                    the great, universal reaction. There is no possibility of confusing him with the
                    dwarfish figures who during the course of the century have diluted his ideas,
                    taken the sap and strength out of his thoughts, and torn and twisted his
                    doctrines in order to oppress and dissemble under cover of them. Joseph de
                    Maistre was a mind, these others have only been bodies. He was a man without
                    baseness and without hypocrisy, a colonel of the Papal Zouaves as <emph>litterateur</emph>,
                    the most soldierlike and the most attractive figure which the reactionary camp
                    of the century has to show.</p>

                <head><pb n="[113]"/> VI. BONALD</head>

                <p>Side by side with Joseph de Maistre stands Bonald, the famous medieval
                    schoolmaster of the European reaction, a man with the same bent of mind and the
                    same practical aims, but as monotonous as De Maistre is versatile, as
                    conventional as De Maistre is wittily fantastic.</p>

                <p>Louis Gabriel Ambroise, Vicomte de Bonald, was born in 1754 (the same year as De
                    Maistre) at Monna, in the south of France. He began life as an officer in Louis
                    XV.'s musketeers. During the first stage of the Revolution he favoured liberal
                    ideas, but only for a short time. He married early, and was made chief
                    magistrate of the Department of Aveyron, an appointment which he resigned when
                    Louis XVI. found himself obliged to consent to the subjection of the clergy to
                    the secular laws. In 1791 he emigrated, and joined the army of the Prince of
                    Condé. He wrote his <emph>Théorie du Pouvoir</emph> at Heidelberg. The police of the
                    Directory destroyed almost the whole first edition of this book, but a copy
                    which had been sent to Bonaparte luckily reached its destination and made such a
                    favourable impression on the great man that he removed its author's name from
                    the list of exiles. Not unprofitably had Bonald taught that every revolution is
                    begun by the subject but ended by the ruler, that it begins because the
                    authorities have been weak and have yielded, and ends because they have
                    recovered strength. He had shown that all disturbance only serves to strengthen
                    authority, and prophesied that the Revolution, which had begun with the
                    declaration of the rights of man, would end with the declaration of the rights
                    of God. These latter being the very rights which Bonaparte, by means of his
                    Concordat, was now proclaiming, Bonald's position was assured. He remained <pb n="114"/> devotedly attached to the Bourbons, but was content to dream of them in an
                    appointment conferred on him by the Emperor. He was made <emph>conseiller tutélaire</emph>
                    of the University, with a salary of 12,000 francs a year for doing nothing.
                    Chateaubriand reviewed his books with reverent admiration. De Maistre wrote to
                    him after the publication of his <emph>Recherches Philosophiques</emph>; »Is it conceivable
                    that nature has amused herself by tuning two strings until they are in as
                    perfect harmony with each other as your mind and mine? If certain manuscripts of
                    mine are ever printed, you will find in them almost the same expressions you
                    yourself have used, and yet I certainly have altered nothing.« In another letter
                    he expresses himself even more strongly: »I have thought nothing which you have
                    not written, and written nothing which you have not thought.« Bonald felt
                    himself flattered by these assertions, though he doubted their truth–and this
                    with good reason, for, similar as are the results arrived at by these
                    comrades-in-arms, there is little resemblance between their mental
                    processes.</p>

                <p>A proof of the high estimation in which Bonald was held is to be found in the
                    touching letter in which Napoleon's brother, Louis, King of Holland, entreats
                    him to undertake the education of his eldest son. Louis begins by telling what a
                    complete invalid he himself is, how dearly he loves his son, how imperative it
                    is that this son should be educated by a man, in the fullest acceptation of that
                    word, in order that he too may become one. Then he says: »Although I do not know
                    you personally, my investigations have led me to the conclusion that you are one
                    of the men whom I esteem most highly. Therefore you will pardon me that now,
                    when I have to choose the person to whom I must entrust what is more to me than
                    life, I apply to you. If the happiness which you doubtless enjoy in a peaceful
                    home has not made you indifferent to the service you are capable of rendering–I
                    do not say to me, a single individual, but to a whole nation which is even more
                    deserving than it is unfortunate (and that is saying much)–you will consent to
                    become my son's tutor.« And he concludes in the same strain, defending himself
                    against slanders which he imagines may have reached<!-- Illustration: []BONALD --> <pb n="115"/> Bonald's ears. With such
                    humility did a king appeal to this man–and in vain; he refused the request.</p>

         

                <p>A still more remarkable instance may be adduced of the importance at that time
                    attributed to the influence of a determined upholder of authority of Bonald's
                    calibre. One day Bonald received a note requesting him to call upon Cardinal
                    Maury, an ecclesiastic whose position under the Empire was a very different one
                    from that of the days when he argued in the National Assembly against the civic
                    rights of the Jews. When they were alone, the Cardinal asked Bonald what his
                    answer would be if the Emperor requested him to undertake the education of the
                    King of Rome. For a moment Bonald was silent, astonished by the honour shown
                    him. He then gave, it is said, the discouraging answer: »I confess that, if I
                    ever taught him to rule, it would be in any place but Rome.« After the
                    restoration of the monarchy no one did more than Bonald to ensure that Rome and
                    its spirit, the principle of authority, should rule in place of being ruled. All
                    his life long he had opposed the liberty of the press. He attained to the
                    position of its censor.</p>

                <p>In 1815 he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies, where he sat on the extreme
                    Right. Under Louis XVIII, he was made a member of the Academy and a peer of
                    France, in which latter capacity he obstinately opposed liberty of religion and
                    liberty of the press. In 1830 he retired from public life because it was against
                    his conscience to swear allegiance to the monarchy of July.</p>

                <p>Any one taking up Bonald's works directly after De Maistre's will have difficulty
                    in wading through them. For nearly all of them are deadly dull. There are no
                    human beings in his books, nothing but doctrines, and Bonald's doctrines consist
                    of theologico-political propositions, which we are required to accept without
                    proof. One cannot imagine a mind with a more implicit belief in dogmas, that is
                    to say, a mind which more entirely ignores realities and scientific thought. He
                    seems never to have doubted. Never once during his long career as an author does
                    it appear to have entered his mind to question any one of the few simple
                    fundamental principles on which he bases his theories. <pb n="116"/> These principles are to
                    be found in his works in a petrified form–speaking exactly, in the form of
                    triads. Like the scholastics of the Middle Ages before him, like Hegel after
                    him, Bonald thinks in triads, only he thinks without any perception of the
                    two-sidedness of ideas, without flexibility, without inspiration. All relations
                    are by him reduced to the great triad of cause, means, and effect. In the state
                    we have power as the cause, ministers as the means, and subjects as the effect.
                    In the religious world we have the triad–God, Jesus the Mediator, and man. In
                    another acceptation Jesus is himself power, minister, and subject–power by his
                    thought, minister by his word, subject as sacrifice. In the political sense,
                    too, he is power, minister, and subject–power as King of the Jews, minister as
                    priest, subject as the submissive martyr.</p>

                <p>In the family, in society, in the state, in the universe, the same tri-unity is
                    demonstrated; and all this is done with the aim of proving the necessity and the
                    truth of monarchy. Monarchy is a true thing because it is founded on the
                    principle by which the world is ordered. The universe is monarchic. Hence
                    revolutionists and republicans, who have dared for the moment to abolish
                    monarchy, have actually been making the bold attempt to overturn the order of
                    the universe. It is not a constitution which they have abolished, but <emph>the</emph>
                    constitution, for there is only one.</p>

                <p>Bonald jeers at the witness of experience, scorns that of history–the lessons of
                    experience are without significance to him who is in possession of the eternal,
                    fundamental principles. Even natural history he will have nothing to do with,
                    because in it he perceives the idea of evolution, which is of the evil one.</p>

                <p>There is no such thing as historical evolution; there is historical tradition,
                    and it is to this we must cling. For by means of tradition we reach God. In the
                    chain of blind men which we call humanity only the first blind man requires a
                    staff, and this staff is the commandment of God, which is transmitted by
                    tradition.</p>

                <p>The eighteenth century had placed more faith than any of its precursors in man's
                    conscious capacity of invention <pb n="117"/> and production. Rousseau maintained that it was
                    man who invented and founded society. Bonald contests this theory. Man, he says,
                    has invented nothing; he no more invented the family or society than he invented
                    speech or writing. He was in the beginning the blank page, the <emph>tabula rasa</emph>, of
                    which Condillac and the Sensationalists romanced–this blank page has not been
                    filled with the impressions of the senses, but with the direct instructions of
                    God.</p>

                <p>For God was not merely the creator »in the beginning«; he continues to create to
                    this very day. He founded society, and founded it that it might preserve his
                    words and his thoughts. But this it can only do by preserving tradition
                    unbroken.</p>

                <p>The intention, the mission of tradition, then, is to keep God in the world. Hence
                    every attempt to break with tradition is an attempt at spiritual suicide. And
                    the endeavour to preserve tradition is simply aspiration after the full
                    pulsation of life. A tenacious clinging to the purest spiritual inheritance
                    produces the purest, fullest life. Therefore Bonald clings to the dogmas and to
                    the supremacy of the Roman Catholic church.</p>

                <p>In order to vindicate the doctrine of creation and continued creative acts in
                    every domain of nature, he is obliged to prove the same immutability in the
                    universe of which he is the advocate in politics; hence from the year 1800
                    onwards he is perpetually attacking what was a comparatively new thing in those
                    days, the doctrine of evolution. Like Voltaire before him and Disraeli after
                    him, he makes merry over the idea of man being descended from a fish.</p>

                <p>With love and understanding, but with a persistently flattering pen, Bonald
                    describes the government of France under kings like Henry IV. and regents like
                    Richelieu. In his turn attacking the revolutionary assailants of the old
                    monarchy and its nobles, he skilfully argues that the monarchy was not the
                    despotism nor the aristocracy the exclusive caste which their detractors made
                    them out to have been. He shrewdly points out the defects of the succeeding
                    system, with its much boasted liberty for every one, which <pb n="118"/> meant no more than
                    that every one had a right to vote, and warmly defends the advantages of the old
                    order of things, which permitted the rich man to become a nobleman, but set
                    limits to plutocracy by prohibiting the nobleman's working to become rich. He
                    wilfully overlooks the fact that the original advantages of the old monarchy
                    existed at last only on paper, and that under its auspices the most shameful
                    injustice and the basest cupidity grew up and prospered.</p>

                <p>In his aversion to the independence of parliaments and courts of justice, to
                    liberty of conscience and liberty of the press, Bonald is doubtless sincere
                    enough, but in his eulogies of the old form of government there is a want of
                    common honesty. As a historian he is ignorant, but not so ignorant as not to
                    know what that government really was.</p>

                <p>His writings are now not only antiquated but decayed. Open his long treatises
                    where we will, a faint odour of dust and musty leaves and corruption meets us.
                    The most important chapters in the once famous <emph>Recherches Philosophiques</emph> (such
                    as those on the origin of speech and writing) read like fragments of some old
                    theological text-book.</p>

                <p>As a general rule the shorter treatises and occasional articles of philosophers
                    of Bonald's type retain most freshness. But one can read through the two thick
                    volumes which Bonald published under the title of <emph>Mélanges littéraires et
                    politiques</emph> without coming upon a single page to which the word »fresh« can be
                    applied. Even such essays as those on the writings of Voltaire, on the Jews, and
                    on tolerance, topics which might have been expected to tempt him to say
                    something strong or bitter–at any rate something which would imprint itself on
                    the memory–are terribly monotonous and colourless. Whether he is disapproving
                    of Voltaire's morality, or maintaining that the Jews ought to be deprived of
                    civic rights, or proving that tolerance is a vice and an impossibility, we have
                    always the same solemn and empty ceremonial, the same application of the formula
                    of cause, means, and effect, the same grave, monotonous tempo–one, two, three;
                    one, two, three. Bonald is unreadable because of the very passionlessness on
                    which he prided himself.</p>

                <p>The only one among his books which still attracts readers, <pb n="119"/> and that simply
                    because of its occasional flashes of passionate enthusiasm, is the famous <emph>Du
                    Divorce</emph>, undoubtedly the most entertaining of them all.</p>

                <p>It begins with a long jeremiad on the sad condition of the world since authority
                    was overthrown. Modern philosophy, which originated in Greece, among that people
                    who remained children to the end, and who ever sought wisdom by other paths than
                    those of reason (<emph>sic!</emph>), began by atheistically or deistically (!) denying God.
                    Now, Hume and Condillac, with their doctrine that all our knowledge is derived
                    from the impressions of the senses, have turned man, who is »a reasonable being,
                    served by his organs,« into an animal pure and simple, an ordinary product of
                    nature. The universal dissolving tendency has penetrated into family life, and
                    instead of the old relation between parents and children–authority and
                    submission–we have the spirit of revolt in the young hearts and ideas of
                    equality in the young brains; the children regard themselves as the equals of
                    their parents, actually permitting themselves to address them as »thou«; the
                    parents, conscious of their own weakness, no longer dare to assert their
                    authority, but try to become their children's »friends« or »confidants«–only
                    too frequently their accomplices.</p>

                <p>The enervated conception of life is imaged in an equally enervated conception of
                    death. It has been proposed to preserve the ashes of the departed in glass or
                    porcelain urns, and, horrible to relate! a mother has actually been permitted by
                    the authorities to burn the corpse of her daughter in heathen fashion. There has
                    been universal agitation for the abolition of capital punishment, that precious
                    institution, <emph>ce premier moyen de conservation de la société</emph>, and in some
                    countries it is already abolished. Governments have had attacks of »the sudden
                    madness which goes by the name of philanthropy.« The so-called natural sciences
                    (»so-called« is amusing), which ought really to be styled the material sciences,
                    because they treat of the material world alone, have ousted the higher, the
                    intellectual sciences, beginning with that of metaphysics, so renowned in days
                    of old. In poetry noble tragedy has had to make way for the light and <pb n="120"/> humorous
                    style. In fiction, which so clearly mirrors the spirit of an age, love used
                    always to be sacrificed to duty. Now the reverse is the case; and it is Rousseau
                    who has written the novel »which more than any other has misled the imagination
                    and corrupted the hearts of women,« namely, <emph>La nouvelle Héloïse</emph>. The principle
                    of authority has been overthrown even in the art of gardening: »The rural
                    uncultivatedness of the English garden has taken the place of the symmetrical
                    splendour of the art of Le Nôtre.«</p>

                <p>In view of all this endeavour to dissolve society, Bonald makes his attempt to
                    save it. It is a special institution which he aims at rescuing. Society is
                    founded upon marriage, stands or falls with that. The Revolution has made
                    divorce lawful. But where divorce is possible, marriage no longer exists.
                    Therefore every possible effort must be made to procure the repeal of the law of
                    divorce. The effort was made, and was only too successful.</p>

                <p>Let us hear what Bonald's theory is.</p>

                <p>He maintains (as usual) that a properly developed reasoning faculty reduces all
                    relations to the triad of ideas–cause, means, and effect–the most universally
                    applicable which reason can evolve. These ideas lie at the foundation of every
                    judgment, and form the basis of all social order. Every society consists of
                    three distinct personages, who may be termed the social personages. Reason
                    perceives in God, who wills, the first <emph>cause</emph>; in the man who executes God's
                    will, the <emph>means</emph>, or minister, or mediator; and in the order of things which
                    goes by the name of society, the <emph>effect</emph> which is produced by the will of God
                    and the action of man. But the reason which argues thus exists, in Bonald's
                    opinion, only in conjunction with the Catholic religion. He says: »Religion,
                    which places God at the head of society, gives man an exalted idea of his own
                    dignity and a strong feeling of independence, whilst philosophy, which assigns
                    the highest place to man himself, is always grovelling at the feet of some idol
                    or other–in Asia at Mahomet's, in Europe at Luther's, Rousseau's, or
                    Voltaire's.« (<emph>Du Divorce</emph>, 42.)</p>

                <p>We observe that Bonald calmly classes Luther with anti-Christians like Mahomet
                    and Voltaire. All the Catholic <pb n="121"/> authors of the period do this, and also insist on
                    the affinity between Protestantism and immorality. When De Maistre is
                    discoursing on the Reformation he asserts with the utmost gravity that one half
                    of Europe changed its religion in order that a dissolute monk might be enabled
                    to marry a nun. In his <emph>Théorie du Pouvoir</emph> (ii. 305) Bonald writes: »A
                    choleric, sensual monk reformed religion in Germany; a voluptuous, cruel king
                    reformed it in England.... It is significant that the Reformation was supported
                    in Germany by the Landgrave of Hesse, who was desirous to marry Margarethe von
                    Saale whilst his first wife still lived; in England by Henry VIII, who wished to
                    divorce Katharine of Arragon in order to marry Anne Boleyn; and in France by
                    Margaret of Navarre, a princess of more than doubtful morals. Divorce was the
                    ruin of the West as polygamy had been of the East.« In his Essay on English
                    Literature (<emph>Œuvres</emph>, vi. 75) Chateaubriand, touching on Luther's marriage,
                    writes: »He married for two reasons–to show a good example, and to deliver
                    himself from temptation. The man who has transgressed laws always tries to draw
                    his weak brethren after him, that he may shield himself behind numbers; he
                    flatters himself that the acquiescence of many will lead men to believe in the
                    propriety and rectitude of acts which were often only the result of accident or
                    passion. Sacred vows were doubly violated–Luther married a nun.«</p>

                <p>These violent outbursts against Luther and Lutheranism are explained by the fact
                    that the French reactionaries, like the German Romanticists, clearly perceived
                    that the modern intellectual tendency of which they were so much afraid was the
                    inevitable result of Protestantism. Lamennais, for example, writes (<emph>Essai sur
                    l'indifférence</emph>): »It is now acknowledged that the church and its dogmas rest
                    upon authority, as upon an impregnable rock. Hence it is that the adherents of
                    all the different sects, who disagree upon every other point, unite in the
                    attempt to undermine this main pillar of all truth. Lutheran, Socinian, Deist,
                    Atheist, are the names which mark the gradual development of the one doctrine;
                    one and all with unflagging perseverance pursue their particular plan of attack
                    on authority.«</p>

                <p><pb n="122"/> Reason, then, Catholic reason, the alone genuine, sees everywhere (according to
                    Bonald) the three social personages–power, minister, and subject. In the
                    different domains of society they receive different names. In the religious
                    world they are called God, priest, and flock; in the political, king,
                    aristocracy or official class, subjects or people; in domestic life, father,
                    mother, and child.</p>

                <p>The reader who is not yet familiar with Bonald's mode of thought is likely to be
                    taken aback by this last idea; but Bonald is so perfectly serious in his
                    identification of the father with power, the mother with the minister, and the
                    child with the subject, that he actually, as a rule, employs the designations
                    father, mother, and child in place of the others; because, he says, they apply
                    to animals as well as to man, whereas power, minister, and subject apply
                    exclusively to thinking beings. Besides, he elsewhere says, we must do our
                    utmost to spiritualise man and his relations in view of the attempts that are
                    made to degrade them.</p>

                <p>He introduces his theory with his customary formulæ. Man and woman, he says, both
                    exist; but their manner of existence is not the same. They are like each other,
                    but not equals. The union of the sexes is the object of the difference between
                    them. The production of a human being is the object of their union. The father
                    is strong, the child weak; the father active, the child inactive. The mother
                    forms the connecting link. How so? The father, says Bonald, is a conscious
                    being, and cannot become a father except with his own will; the mother, on the
                    contrary, may, even with full consciousness, become a mother <emph>against her will</emph>
                    (hence inactively). The child neither wills to be born nor is conscious of being
                    born.</p>

                <p>It is, thus, upon that revolting and tragic arrangement of nature which permits a
                    woman to become a mother against her will that Bonald bases the difference in
                    rank of the sexes. He says, moreover (<emph>Du Divorce</emph>, fifth edition, p. 71): »In
                    this gradation of their relationship is to be found the solution of the question
                    of divorce,« namely, that it ought not to be allowed.</p>

                <p>If Bonald's mad theory, like many another equally <pb n="123"/> mad, had simply remained a
                    theory, which no one dreamt of putting into practice, there would be nothing to
                    resent. But it was upon the principles proclaimed in his work that the laws of
                    marriage and divorce which held good in France for the next seventy years were
                    based!<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Louis de Viel-Castel, <emph>Histoire de la Restauration</emph>, iv. 487.</note> Immediately after the restoration of the Bourbons (twelve years after
                    the publication of <emph>Du Divorce</emph>) Bonald's influence was so irresistible that the
                    lethargic, religiously disposed National Assembly abolished divorce by an
                    overwhelming majority–236 to 11 votes.</p>

                <p>It may be said, proceeds Bonald, writing of education, that the father is the
                    power which, through the mother as minister or means, performs the reproductive
                    and maintaining acts, which have the child as object or »subject.«</p>

                <p>The relation of man and woman in marriage is simply this: Man is power (<emph>le
                    pouvoir</emph>), woman is duty (<emph>le devoir</emph>). Does not Holy Scripture itself call man
                    woman's head (or reason), woman man's helpmeet (or minister), and signify that
                    the child is the subject by perpetually inculcating obedience as its duty?</p>

                <p>Woman resembles man as man resembles God. Man is created in the image of God, but
                    is not because of this his equal. Woman is made of the flesh and blood of man,
                    but is his inferior. Bonald's theory chimes in with Milton's: »He for God only,
                    she for God in him.« (<emph>Paradise Lost</emph>, Book IV.) He says: »The society of the
                    family is a society to which the man contributes the protecting power of
                    strength, the woman the necessities of weakness; he <emph>le pouvoir</emph>, she <emph>le
                    devoir</emph>.« Thus does the French philosopher caricature the doctrine of St. Paul,
                    which, in its day, was a great and noble advance in the direction of the
                    emancipation of woman.</p>

                <p>What, then, is Bonald's definition of marriage? Marriage is the engagement
                    entered into by two persons of opposite sexes to found a society–the society
                    which is called a family. It is this engagement which distinguishes marriage
                    from every other species of cohabitation of man and woman. Bonald refers with
                    the utmost indignation to <pb n="124"/> Condorcet's witty saying, that if men have any duty
                    towards the beings who do not yet exist, it cannot be that of endowing them with
                    existence. »Indeed it is!« he exclaims. »Marriage exists for the express purpose
                    of continuing the race.« But we are not therefore to conclude, maintains Bonald,
                    that a childless marriage, that is to say, a marriage which appears to have
                    failed in accomplishing its purpose, may be dissolved; for, by annulling the
                    first marriage in order to legalise a second, the production of children in the
                    first is made impossible, without their production in the second being
                    positively ensured. Though a husband and wife have no children, there is always
                    a possibility that children may come; and since marriage is only instituted for
                    the sake of the possible children, the fact that they as yet have none is no
                    reason for annulling it. To Bonald marriage is the possible society, to which
                    the family, as the real society, corresponds. »<emph>The object of marriage</emph>» he
                    teaches, «<emph>is not the happiness of the wedded pair.</emph>» What, then, is its object?
                    «<emph>Marriage</emph>» he answers, «<emph>exists for the sake of society.</emph>« In marriage
                    religion and the state see only the duties which it imposes.</p>

                <p>But if marriage exists only for the sake of society, what, we eagerly ask, is the
                    aim of society? True to his theological dogma, that society by preserving its
                    tradition, <emph>i.e.</emph> itself, preserves nothing less than God, Bonald answers (as
                    indeed he must) with the empty formula: <emph>The aim of society is its own
                        preservation</emph>.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">»La société a pour parvenir à sa fin, <emph>qui est sa conservation, des lois</emph>«.
                            <emph>Du Divorce</emph>, 107.</note></p>

                <p>Not a word does he waste upon the vain supposition that institutions exist for
                    man's sake; not a thought does he bestow on human happiness, on the development
                    of the race, or the evolution of human greatness.</p>

                <p>The one and only vital consideration being the production and welfare of
                    children, polygamy, the putting away of a wife, and divorce seem to Bonald all
                    equally reprehensible. He remarks that the introduction of divorce and the
                    introduction of polygamy seem to follow naturally one on the other, seeing that
                    Luther (this story appears in every single book <pb n="125"/> of our period), who permitted
                    divorce, also, though in all secrecy, countenanced the bigamy of the Landgrave
                    of Hesse. Bonald declares that he sees no difference between the polygamy which
                    consists in having several wives at the same time and that which consists in
                    having them one after the other; he forgets that he hereby pronounces a second
                    marriage, after the death of husband or wife, to be as culpable as marriage
                    after divorce. Everywhere, he declares, where divorce is legal, and where,
                    consequently, a woman is entitled to see in every man a possible husband, the
                    women are devoid of chastity, or at any rate of modesty. He instances England as
                    an example–England. He compares the state of matters in that country, where in
                    given cases divorce is permitted, with the conditions prevailing among certain
                    savage races, where the husband obliges his wife's lover, when he catches him
                    <emph>in flagranti delicto</emph>, to pay for a pig, which the three roast and eat in
                    company. England, with its comparatively liberal institutions, is Bonald's and
                    Lamennais' scapegoat. Lamennais says of England that nowhere else is there to be
                    found a population as blunted, as destitute of the sense of morality, of higher
                    ideas, of everything that elevates the mind and ennobles human life.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom"><emph>Progrès de la révolution et de la guerre contre l'église</emph>, p. 35.</note></p>

                <p>All this is exaggeration, and of a most untruthful and illogical kind. But there
                    is both logic and truth in what gives these details their significance, namely,
                    Bonald's conception of the close connection between the question of divorce and
                    the whole political question. He sees that a republic or <emph>democracy</emph> (the
                    Republic is so obnoxious to him that he will not even use the word) inevitably
                    leads to the loosening of the marriage tie.</p>

                <p>He writes: »In 1792 divorce was legalised. No one was surprised, for this was one
                    of the inevitable and long-foreseen consequences of the process of demolition
                    carried on at that time with such ardour; but now, when our desire is to
                    re-build, now, divorce entering as a principle into the edifice of society,
                    shakes that edifice to its very foundations. Divorce was in harmony with the
                    democracy which has too long ruled in France under different names and forms. In <pb n="126"/> domestic as well as in public affairs power was delivered over to the passions
                    of <emph>the subjects</emph>; there was disorder in the family and disorder in the state;
                    there was similarity and harmony between the two disorders. But it is plain to
                    every one that divorce is directly at variance with the spirit of the hereditary
                    and indissoluble monarchy. If we retain divorce, we have order in the state and
                    disorder in the family–indissolubility here, dissolubility there, hence no
                    harmony. On that side to which man is inclined to bend, the law must prop him
                    up; in our days it must forbid disorganised natures disorganisation, as in olden
                    days it forbade half-savage barbarians cruel and bloody vengeance.«</p>

                <p>Thus Bonald succeeds in resting his theory of marriage upon his fundamental
                    principle of sovereignty by the grace of God. The conclusion he arrives at is
                    that divorce ought to be unconditionally prohibited, and that simple separation
                    without permission to marry again is a sufficient remedy for the ills arising
                    from unfortunate marriages. When his theories became laws, the marriage laws of
                    France, they produced a state of matters in that country which excited the
                    ridicule of the whole world–a state of matters which, for example, made it
                    impossible for a young girl whose bridegroom ran off with her dowry on the
                    wedding day ever to marry again or have lawful offspring. In the case of
                    incendiaries and murderers the law permitted the plea of extenuating
                    circumstances; they might be set at liberty after behaving well for a certain
                    number of years; but, according to Bonald's doctrine and the laws of France, the
                    deserted, victimised young girl had not the same hope of liberty that was
                    extended to the girl who had burned a whole family in their beds or murdered her
                    own father.</p>

                <p>The scheme for a code of civil law prepared by the Convention contained the
                    following clauses:–</p>

                <p>In the matter of marriage men are free to act as they please, that is to say,
                    marriage comes under the category of matters of conscience.</p>

                <p>It is the formation of an alliance in which man and woman stand on an equal
                    footing.</p>

                <p><pb n="127"/> The contracting parties are free to determine the conditions of their union.</p>

                <p>Husband and wife have or exercise equal rights as regards the disposal of their
                    property.</p>

                <p>Divorce is permissible if desired by both or by one of the spouses.</p>

                <p>The law forbids any limitation of the right of divorce.</p>

                <p>It appears that the great liberty in the matter of divorce thus suddenly bestowed
                    was, like all suddenly acquired liberty, abused at first. Both men and women,
                    without bestowing much thought on their children, recklessly gave way to
                    ephemeral passions which had neither the justification nor the dignity of true
                    love. Corresponding phenomena are to be found throughout all history, wherever
                    fetters have been broken. But for those who, like Bonald, had no faith in
                    liberty and believed in no disciplining power except that of restraint, what
                    occurred sufficiently proved the necessity of returning to the old order of
                    things.</p>

                <p>The ideal marriage (an ideal which will never be lost sight of and which is
                    sometimes realised) is, of course, that in which the two united human beings
                    love each other till death, nay, with a love that lasts beyond death. But this
                    ideal marriage is the result of a rare, fortunate choice, not of compulsory
                    laws.</p>

                <p>For such laws the children formed the natural pretext. Bonald propounds his
                    doctrine of the rights of the child in the following effective, admirably
                    expressed proposition: »As the contract of marriage concerns three persons, the
                    father, the mother, and the child, it cannot be annulled because two agree in
                    desiring that it should be. Since the child is under age, society defends its
                    cause against its parents, and as the child's advocate protests against the
                    dissolubility of marriage.« This argument premises, in the first place, that the
                    continuance of the marriage at all costs is what is undoubtedly best for the
                    child, a premise which is distinctly open to doubt. In the second place, it
                    presupposes the welfare of the child to be the one vital and all-important
                    matter, a presupposition which only adherents of the principle of authority can
                    be expected to accept without proof. And <pb n="128"/> lastly, it takes account only of the
                    children born in wedlock, regarding the others as non-existent, though it is
                    well known that one of the saddest results of the traditional order of things is
                    that not all children are born with equal claims upon their parents, nor,
                    consequently, upon society. Bonald's social order, in which the welfare of the
                    child is declared to be of supreme importance, has in our day led to more than
                    2,800,000 French men and women being born as illegitimate children, in an
                    undeserved inferiority to their parents which is more strongly insisted on in
                    France than in other countries.</p>

                <p>But, absurd in many of its details as Bonald's theory is, it is valuable, nay,
                    precious, as being in all its main features a consistent application of the
                    principle of authority in the domain of the family. Bonald has, what
                    semi-liberals never have, a keen perception of the connection between the
                    political and the social principles of the Revolution. He is not able, like
                    those whose very essence is foolish inconsistency, to separate the former from
                    the latter, and to overlook the fact that the traditional theory of marriage,
                    which is still in part the accepted one, is most intimately connected with the
                    traditional theory of the state, which is now generally rejected.</p>

                <p>The connection becomes obvious whenever the matter is discussed. The American
                    slave-owners defended themselves against the accusations of the abolitionists by
                    declaring that the relations existing between slaves and their masters were in
                    no respect vitally different from those existing in the family and in marriage.
                    We see, too, that quite as much has been said and written against the
                    permissibility of divorce in any case whatever as would be said and written
                    to-day against a proposal to increase the facility of divorce, or, indeed,
                    against any change in the received conception of what makes the union of man and
                    woman desirable.</p>

                <p>In this province, as in every other, the principle of authority has as its
                    opponent the principle of free thought–in various forms. If we leave the
                    socialistic theories (which we shall consider later in connection with the
                    Saint-Simonists) altogether out of the question, we find authority confronted in
                    the matter under discussion by free thought in <pb n="129"/> the shape of the principle of
                    individualism, as developed by English, French, and American thinkers. The code
                    of laws drafted by the Convention, from which extracts have been given above, is
                    based on this principle, the fundamental idea of which is that it is not, as is
                    generally maintained, the family, but the individual human being who is the main
                    pillar of society, and that this individual is sovereign. The doctrine of the
                    sovereignty of God, as proclaimed by the devotees of hereditary autocracy, and
                    the ambiguous doctrine of the sovereignty of the people, as proclaimed by the
                    revolutionary worshippers of the majority, are superseded by the doctrine of
                    <emph>the sovereignty of the individual</emph> (an expression first employed by the
                    American writer Samuel Warren, from whom it was borrowed by John Stuart
                    Mill).<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">John Stuart Mill, <emph>Autobiography</emph>, p. 256.</note> Sovereignty of the individual ensures, as the phrase implies, the
                    absolute liberty of every human being–prohibits any man's usurping any
                    authority or control whatever over other men. The adherents of this doctrine
                    say: <emph>Either</emph> tutelage for every one, <emph>i.e.</emph> censorship of the press, a regular
                    police-spy system, passports, tariffs, prohibition of divorce, laws regulating
                    the intercourse of the sexes–the whole system of arbitrary restriction of the
                    freedom of the individual, <emph>or</emph> the sovereignty of the individual, <emph>i.e.</emph>
                    liberty of the press, liberty of speech, liberty to travel, free-trade, liberty
                    of research, and liberty in the relations of the sexes. From their standpoint
                    the only possible vindication of a law which restricts the liberty of the
                    individual is that the provisional compulsory order of things is merely the
                    speediest means of arriving at a more perfect order of things with more complete
                    liberty–for liberty is the ideal of individualism. The thinkers of this school
                    regard the interference of the state in matters of the affections as
                    unwarranted; they maintain that the legal tie which keeps two beings of opposite
                    sexes united is <emph>either superfluous</emph>–when it is their own wish to remain
                    united, <emph>or revolting</emph>–when it is not their wish. They hold that society acts
                    most criminally towards a married couple, one of whom detests the other, if it
                    obliges them to remain together and bring children into being, the fruit of the
                    desire of the one and the <pb n="130"/> loathing of the other. They consider it revolting that
                    society should compel a woman against her will to bear a child to a drunkard, a
                    child which from its birth possesses its father's depraved instincts and lusts.
                    And they consider it equally terrible that a man's whole life should be
                    sacrificed to a connection which reduces him to despair. They take as much
                    thought of the children yet unborn as Bonald does of those already in existence.
                    They do not, like him, see in the fact that it is possible for a woman to become
                    a mother against her will a proof of the imperfection of woman, but a proof of
                    the uncivilised condition of society. Clearly perceiving the interdependence of
                    all the different provinces of human life, they maintain it to be most
                    improbable that one alone of these provinces should be, by means of tradition,
                    absolutely rightly ordered, seeing that the ordering of all the others has been
                    found to be altogether wrong and has consequently been completely changed in the
                    course of the last hundred years. Such is the line of argument most frequently
                    employed by writers of this school.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">See, for example, Stephen Pearl Andrews, <emph>Love, Marriage, and Divorce</emph> (New
                        York); also Émile de Girardin, <emph>L'homme et la femme</emph>.</note> In this case, as in many others, it is
                    doubtful if pure liberalism points out the right way of arriving at the desired
                    end. The principle is stated here simply as being the direct opposite of that of
                    authority. What is undoubtedly desirable, in this as in every other case, is
                    absolute liberty of investigation. If a thinker in a Catholic country expresses
                    his opinion freely on the subject of the mass, or any other of the prescribed
                    rites and practices of the church, he is, as a rule, dubbed a scorner of
                    religion in general, if not an atheist. For the orthodox Catholic believes that
                    »religion« consists in, or at least can only exist in combination with, certain
                    ecclesiastical traditions and customs with which in his consciousness it has
                    always been associated. It never occurs to him that the assailant of these
                    customs may have a far nobler and purer conception of religion than himself. He
                    has observed that those whom he has hitherto found wanting in respect for the
                    ordinances of religion have been disorderly, immoral men, capable of all kinds
                    of foolish <pb n="131"/> actions. From this he too quickly draws a general conclusion; his
                    intellect is not sufficiently developed to enable him to distinguish between the
                    different types of assailants; he confuses the earnest thinker and champion of a
                    higher truth with the common rabble of graceless scoffers–confuses his superior
                    with his inferiors.</p>

                <p>The very same thing happens in the matter of the traditional conception of the
                    proper relation of the sexes. The rules and regulations of this relation in a
                    given country at a given time are no more marriage than Catholicism in Spain in
                    the eighteenth century is religion. Some men are below the standard presupposed
                    by the institution of marriage as it exists, some are above it, whilst the
                    majority in civilised countries exactly come up to it, bring public opinion into
                    harmony with their views, and, confounding the two groups of those who think
                    otherwise, hold them up together to public scorn.</p>

                <p>The same idea which leads to the assertion of the principle of authority in
                    religion and in the state leads to its assertion in the matter of the relation
                    of the sexes.</p>

                <p>The mistake as regards religion consists in the supposition that the church,
                    because its mission for centuries has been to ennoble, is of essential
                    importance in the production of nobler feelings and thoughts–the supposition
                    that love of truth is not natural to man, increasing with his general
                    development, but must be communicated to him and kept up in him by the perpetual
                    agency of bishops, priests, churches, church councils, &amp;c.</p>

                <p>The corresponding mistake in the matter of the mutual relations of man and woman
                    lies in the belief that human beings do not by nature love order and refinement
                    in this relation, and love it the more the more highly developed and
                    consequently refined they are, that men do not instinctively love their children
                    and protect their children's mother, but that all these qualities and virtues
                    must be first manufactured, then preserved in the human soul by the aid of
                    legislation–although the requisite laws are, strangely enough, only produced by
                    the combined action of all those persons who, taken separately, are supposed to <pb n="132"/> be devoid of the qualities and virtues in question. Entirely the opposite of
                    this is the real truth; it is only their love of these same virtues and
                    blessings which induces men patiently to submit to all the artificial
                    arrangements and compulsory rules under which they groan. They submit because it
                    has been impressed on them from their childhood that such institutions as the
                    existing ones are the only guarantee for the maintenance of the virtues and
                    benefits they so highly prize.</p>

                <p>One result of this state of matters is the repression or complete prevention of
                    all unprejudiced inquiry into the nature and working of the human soul; men are
                    trained to accept unquestioningly as truth everything that bears the warrant of
                    tradition or authority, and the opponents of the principle of authority are
                    accused of desiring and favouring immorality.</p>

                <p>If a man set himself seriously to ascertain what in our day is the most degrading
                    and stultifying of all the principles that exist upon this earth, he could not
                    avoid arriving at the conclusion that the principle of authority is the one most
                    deserving of this unenviable distinction.</p>

                <p>The principle of authority consistently applied produces such axioms as: Marriage
                    exists for the sake of society, and the object of society is to preserve itself,
                    or–the same thing differently put: Marriage in its traditional form is sacred,
                    because it is indispensable to the preservation of pure morality. And in what
                    does pure morality consist? In the preservation of marriage in its traditional
                    form.</p>

                <p>There is no progress possible on these lines. We go round in a ring without
                    moving from the spot.</p>

                <p>But if, on the contrary, the opponents of the principle of authority insist: The
                    object of society is the greatest happiness of its members, and the object of
                    marriage the welfare of the family, we are left free to find out what this
                    welfare and this greatest happiness are. And if they further say: »Moral purity
                    consists in that species of relation between beings of opposite sexes which
                    conduces most to their development and mutual happiness, taking the farthest off
                    as well as the immediate results of the union into consideration,« this <pb n="133"/> definition, supposing it to be accepted or put to the test of experiment, leaves
                    such freedom for thorough and scientific investigation into all that concerns
                    the health of the body, of the soul, and of society as has never before been
                    known.</p>

                <p>Order and refinement! These were the watchwords of the champions of the principle
                    of authority. By all means let us have order and refinement–but what men have
                    had to learn, and what they will learn even though it should take them
                    centuries, is that order and refinement are the work of science or natural
                    development, and never are or can be the work of arbitrary legislation, or of a
                    criminal code and a public opinion founded upon tradition and authority. There
                    is no real ordering, no real order of society but that which is the result of
                    scientific insight into the nature of man. All societies–the society called the
                    family as well as that called the state–exist, not for their own sake, but for
                    the sake of men, for the purpose of enabling each individual composing them to
                    attain certain great aims and great benefits. Such aims and benefits are
                    personal development, moral purity, the education of the young, the protection
                    of women.</p>

                <p>If these objects can only be attained in the manner indicated by the principle of
                    authority, then of course liberty, in so many other domains regarded as a
                    blessing, is in these domains to be regarded as a curse, and is to be attacked
                    and exterminated. But if they can <emph>possibly</emph> be attained in other ways, possibly
                    be attained <emph>better</emph> in other ways (and such a possibility is difficult to
                    disprove), if, finally, the measure of attainment arrived at in the traditional
                    manner is hardly worth taking into account, then absolutely free inquiry,
                    without regard to human or superhuman authority, is man's bounden duty. In a
                    century such as that in which we live the principle of authority, as the
                    principle which prevents all free inquiry, is the worst, the most stupid, and
                    the most degrading that can be imagined, and stands self-condemned. The man who,
                    by deriding or forbidding free investigation into any social question
                    whatsoever, prevents, as he undoubtedly does, the suggestion of hypotheses and
                    the trying of practical experiments which might prove to be of value to his
                    fellow-men, is a criminal, <pb n="134"/> for whom, if there were equity and justice upon
                    earth, no punishment would be considered too severe. It unfortunately happens
                    that the majority of educated men are criminals of this class, so that the
                    prospect of having them punished is very slight.</p>

                <p>Bonald was such a criminal; but in his outward circumstances we can find no trace
                    of the pursuit of an avenging Nemesis. He lived to the age of eighty-six, and
                    was all his life one of the most influential and respected men of his period. He
                    died in 1840, full of days and of honour.</p>

                <p>There was no poetry in France under the Empire. Chateaubriand was doubtless an
                    author with great poetic gifts, but Napoleon was the one poet in the grand
                    style. Chateaubriand who hated him, felt this. He writes (in the fourth part of
                    his <emph>Mémoires</emph>): »A marvellous power of imagination inspired this cold
                    politician; but for his muse he would not have been what he was. His intellect
                    carried out his poetic ideas.« The long succession of his wars, victories, and
                    defeats was a great Iliad, the Russian campaign a giant tragedy, with which none
                    written at a desk could compare.</p>

                <p>Even in the days of the Revolution, for kindred reasons, poetry had disappeared.
                    A few poets still wrote tragedies in the old style; only they transformed
                    Voltaire's philosophical tragedy into political tragedy, exploiting the
                    republics of Rome and Greece for the benefit of the new French Republic, which
                    discovered the prototypes of its heroes in the men whom it called the
                    sansculottes of Rome and Athens. But the interest of these plays could not
                    compare with the interest of the great dramas of the National Assembly and the
                    Convention. Just as in ancient days the gladiatorial combats destroyed men's
                    appreciation of plays in which no one was really killed, now the fifth acts of
                    tragedies seemed flat and stale in comparison with the concluding scenes in the
                    meetings of the Convention, during which the vanquished were led off to the
                    scaffold. The dagger of Melpomene could not, in the long run, compete with the
                    guillotine. Who by means of a poetical work could produce an emotion at all
                    corresponding to what the audience felt on the occasion of the impeachment,
                    sentence, and death of the King and Queen? Who could devise stage plots to
                    compare with Robespierre's and Danton's <pb n="136"/> plots against Vergniaud and the
                    Girondists, or the snares that were afterwards laid for Robespierre? We have
                    evidence that this was the feeling of contemporaries. Ducis, the famous
                    translator of Shakespeare, replies to a friend who has been urging him to write
                    for the theatre: »Do not talk to me of tragedies! We have tragedies in every
                    street. I have but to put my foot out at the door to step into blood up to the
                    ankles.« That there is not much exaggeration in these words is proved by a
                    letter written by Chaumette in 1793 to the municipal authorities of Paris, in
                    which he complains that short-sighted persons were constantly exposed to the
                    unpleasantness of stepping into human blood.</p>

                <p>Under Napoleon there is another circumstance to be taken into account, namely,
                    that France had a master. When an author attempted any slight deviation from the
                    beaten track, he was promptly checked. Take Raynouard for an example. His play,
                    <emph>Les États de Blois</emph>, which had been performed at St. Cloud, was prohibited in
                    Paris by express order of the Emperor. It was the cannon's turn to speak. The
                    great cannon in front of the Invalides, which was constantly thundering out the
                    intelligence of a new victory, drowned every other voice. And all the hearts
                    full of youthful enthusiasm, all the ardent souls that at another time would
                    have vented their ardour in poetry, all those who were most warmly attached to
                    liberty and to the ideas of the Revolution, crowded to the colours, and
                    endeavoured to forget their longing for liberty and poetry in the intoxication
                    of martial glory. Intellectual life was extinguished as a sweet song sung in a
                    room is stopped by the incessant rattling of heavy carts through the street. A
                    couple of anecdotes may serve to illustrate the noisiness and the depression. To
                    the question, »What do you think at this time?« Sièyes replied, »I do not
                    think.« To the question, »What have you done under the Empire for your
                    convictions?« General Lafayette replied, »I have remained standing upright.«</p>

                <p>Two of the arts were susceptible of inspiration by the spirit of the time–the
                    art of the painter and the art of the actor. Gérard painted the battle of
                    Austerlitz, Gros the plague scenes at Jaffa, the battle of Aboukir, and the <pb n="137"/> battle of the Pyramids. Talma, who, as he himself tells, learned for the first
                    time one evening when he was in company with the leaders of the Girondists to
                    understand and to represent Roman Republicans, not as they exist in the
                    imagination of school-boys, but as men–Talma learned from Napoleon to play the
                    parts of Cæsars and of kings. According to the well known story, Bonaparte
                    employed Talma to instruct him in the art of assuming imperial attitudes. The
                    real truth is the reverse of this. It was from Napoleon that Talma learned the
                    authoritative deportment, the short, commanding tone, the imperious gestures
                    which he then reproduced on the stage. When, in 1826, the great actor lay
                    consumed with raging fever, he carefully examined in a mirror the traces of
                    madness and terror on his own face, and, half mad at the time, struck himself on
                    the forehead and cried: »Now I have it! If I ever act again, I shall do exactly
                    this when I play the part of Charles VI.« Thus passionately did this man love
                    his art. But from his sick-bed he was not to rise again.</p>

                <p>One branch of literature alone acquired an influence which it had not before
                    possessed–the youngest of all the branches, which had hitherto been of no
                    importance, but which soon became a power–the newspaper. The well-known
                    <emph>Journal des Débats</emph> was started to begin the attack upon Voltaire and to
                    provide the prevailing ideas of the day with an organ. The French clerical press
                    employed every possible means to attain its end. In exactly the same spirit
                    which led it, after the Franco-Prussian war, to dub Voltaire »the miserable
                    Prussian,« it now searched his letters for passages which might convict him of
                    treachery to his country. In one of the letters to the King of Prussia the great
                    Frenchman's detractors discovered the offensive phrase: »Every time I write to
                    Your Majesty I tremble as our regiments did at Rossbach;« and they hoped with
                    the aid of quotations such as this to irritate the victor of Jena with the
                    philosophers of the school of Voltaire. They emphasised the fact that, according
                    to the testimony of contemporaries, the principal cause of the faintheartedness
                    shown by the French army in the war with Frederick was the fanatic <pb n="138"/> admiration of
                    its officers for that king, a feeling which actually prevented their believing
                    in the possibility of defeating a general who shared and favoured the
                    convictions by which they themselves were inspired. In place of drawing an
                    inference from this favourable to the convictions or ideas in question, the
                    clerical party drew one unfavourable to the persons who, like Voltaire, had
                    promulgated these ideas in France; they denounced them as traitors to their
                    country. The following utterance of the editor of the <emph>Journal des Débats</emph> gives
                    us some notion of the general tone of that paper: »When I say the philosophy of
                    the eighteenth century, I mean everything that is false in legislation, morals,
                    and politics.« The Neo-Catholics had another newspaper entirely in their hands,
                    the <emph>Mercure de France</emph>, the most notable contributors to which were
                    Chateaubriand and Bonald. The authors who formed the remnant of the army of the
                    eighteenth century attempted to combat the influence of these powerful journals,
                    but with little success.</p>

                <p>In former days the whole energy of the contending parties had been expended in
                    winning over the reading public, or the nation, to their respective sides; now
                    the desire of both was to win the favour of the mighty potentate. The <emph>Journal
                    des Débats</emph> endeavoured to stir up the Emperor's wrath against »philosophy.«
                    »The philosophers« tried to make him angry with the <emph>Journal des Débats</emph>. The
                    clerical party denounced the philosophers as destroyers by profession, who, as
                    such, must inevitably hate Napoleon, the great master-builder. The philosophers
                    accused the clericals of intending, as soon as the Emperor's building was
                    completed, to hand over the keys of it to another.</p>

                <p>The future showed that the philosophers were right. The adherents of the
                    Neo-Catholic school were and remained closely attached to the old royal family.
                    Their mode of procedure was to praise Delille because he was in disgrace, and
                    Chateaubriand because, by resigning his appointment after the execution of the
                    Duke of Enghien, he proved himself to be an enemy of tyranny. They drew men's
                    attention to all the good points of the old régime under pretext of writing
                    history.</p>

                <p><pb n="139"/> Napoleon, who kept a keen eye upon journalistic literature, at last lost
                    patience. A written communication has been preserved which was put into the
                    hands of one of the Emperor's officials, to be by him transmitted to Fiévée, the
                    publisher of the <emph>Mercure</emph> (a man with whom the Emperor sometimes corresponded
                    privately). Every word in this paper is significant; note particularly the
                    change from the impersonal third to the first person singular. There is no
                    direct indication as to who is the writer of the document; in the beginning it
                    is that indefinite, anonymous being, the Government, that speaks; then all at
                    once we feel who is wielding the pen–the lion shows his claws. »Monsieur de
                    Lavalette will go to Monsieur Fiévée and say to him that in the <emph>Journal des
                    Débats</emph>, which is read with more attention than the other newspapers, because it
                    has ten times as large a circulation, articles have been found, written in a
                    spirit altogether favourable to the Bourbons, consequently with complete
                    indifference to the welfare of the state; say that it has been determined to
                    suppress any articles in this paper that are too ill-affected; that the system
                    pursued is undoubtedly a system of long-suffering; that it is, however, not
                    enough that they should not be directly hostile; that the Government has the
                    right to demand that they shall be entirely devoted to the reigning house, and
                    that they shall not suffer but oppose everything which can add lustre to the
                    cause of the Bourbons or evoke reminiscences favourable to them; that as yet no
                    decisive step has been determined on; that the inclination is to permit the
                    <emph>Journal des Débats</emph> to continue to appear if men are presented to <emph>me</emph> in whom
                    <emph>I</emph> can have confidence, and to whom <emph>I</emph> can entrust the editorship of the
                    paper.«<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Nettement, <emph>Histoire de la littérature française sous la
                        Restauration</emph>, i. 100.</note></p>

                <p>We observe the direction which events were taking. During the course of the
                    Emperor's reign Neo-Catholicism lost ever more and more of that favour which it
                    at first enjoyed, and not until the return of the Bourbons did it once more
                    completely triumph. Immediately after the accession of Napoleon, Chateaubriand,
                    Bonald, and De Maistre have full liberty to write, the <emph>Journal des Débats</emph> is <pb n="140"/> encouraged to undertake its crusade against the philosophy of the eighteenth
                    century, the Pope visits Napoleon in Paris, all honour is shown to the clergy,
                    Frayssinous preaches where and what he pleases. During the last years of the
                    Empire the leaders of the Catholic party are compelled to be silent, the
                    <emph>Journal des Débats</emph> is suppressed, the Pope is a prisoner, the clergy are in
                    deep disgrace, and Frayssinous may not preach at all.–Not until the monarchy
                    was restored was there a rehabilitation of ecclesiasticism, a confirmation of
                    what had been begun by the Concordat.</p>

                <p>It has been said, and said with truth, that no real poetry was written under the
                    rule of Napoleon; nevertheless an attempt, and by no means an insignificant
                    attempt, was made at this time to give to the France of the nineteenth century
                    what Voltaire in his <emph>Henriade</emph> had attempted to give to the France of the
                    eighteenth–neither more nor less than a great national epic.</p>

                <p>It cannot be denied that the task was a tolerably hopeless one. At a time when
                    all Europe was resounding with the names of the heroes of the new empire, and
                    Napoleon was, as has been said, »binding the open wounds of France with the
                    flags of her enemies,« when the doings of the day were throwing all the doings
                    of times past into the shade, where was an author to find a hero for an epic or
                    deeds that would enthral the reading world?</p>

                <p>The enterprise was undertaken by no less a man than Chateaubriand, the successful
                    initiator of the literary movement of the period, the most admired author of his
                    day. It was not only inclination but also a certain feeling of duty which
                    induced Chateaubriand to undertake a great epic work. In his first work he had
                    maintained that the legends of Christianity infinitely surpassed in beauty those
                    of heathen mythology; that they appealed far more strongly to the poet; that the
                    Christian, as father, husband, lover, bride, was more admirable and of more
                    value to art than the mere natural being. He felt obliged to follow up his rule
                    with an example, his theory with proof; and for this reason, and also to show
                    what he was capable of, he determined to write a Christian epic.</p>

                <p><pb n="141"/> True to the intellectual tendency of which he had been the first distinguished
                    exponent, he did not choose modern or active heroes, in fact did not choose
                    heroes at all, but martyrs as his theme. They also give the name to his work,
                    <emph>Les Martyrs ou le Triomphe de la Religion Chrétienne</emph>, which, written as it is
                    in prose, produces more the effect of an ordinary two-volume novel than of an
                    epic. To understand this choice of subject we must remember that the point of
                    view of the men of this school was not really that of the Empire at all, but
                    that of the returned <emph>émigrés</emph>. They had not yet recovered from the horror
                    excited in them by the deeds of the Revolution. In the leaders of the Revolution
                    they saw only men of blood, in the vanquished party only hapless victims. In
                    their eyes the real hero was not the conqueror, not the adventurous soldier, but
                    Louis XVI., the innocent sufferer. What were they if not martyrs, all those
                    Christian priests who in the Days of September were murdered for the sake of
                    their religion, all those men and women who died in La Vendée for their loyalty
                    to the King by the grace of God! Victims as innocent as the Princesse de
                    Lamballe, or the maidens of Verdun, or the lately executed Duke of Enghien, were
                    heroines and heroes a thousand times more worthy to be sung than the men who
                    were defiling themselves with blood on all the battle-fields of Europe.</p>

                <p>In 1802 Chateaubriand conceived the idea of his epic; in 1806 the first cantos
                    were ready for publication. But the events of the epic were to happen in all
                    parts of the world known to the Romans. Chateaubriand was not indolent by
                    nature; it was not his aim to finish the work as quickly as possible in order to
                    rest upon his laurels. He stopped short, and in July 1806 went off to travel in
                    Greece, Syria, Egypt, and Carthaginian Africa, returning through Spain. The one
                    object of this tour was, he himself gives us to understand in the prefaces to
                    <emph>Les Martyrs</emph> and the <emph>Notes of Travel (Itinéraire)</emph>, the perfecting of his
                    work. In the one preface we read: »This journey was undertaken for the sole
                    purpose of seeing and paint<pb n="142"/>ing those districts in which I intended to lay the
                    scenes of <emph>Les Martyrs</emph>«; in the other: »I did not undertake this journey in
                    order to describe it. I had a purpose, and that purpose I have accomplished in
                    <emph>Les Martyrs</emph>; I went in quest of pictures–that was all.«</p>

                <p>No, that was not all–neither all that Chateaubriand proposed to himself in
                    taking the journey, nor even all that he wished others to see in it.
                    Chateaubriand is Childe Harold before the real Childe Harold; he is a legitimist
                    and Roman Catholic Byron. His René is the forerunner of the Byronic heroes; he
                    himself, in his pilgrimages, is a forerunner of that half-fictitious, half-real
                    Harold whom love of adventure and longing for new impressions drive from land to
                    land. But the Byron of the ecclesiastical revival could not, like the English
                    nobleman who still felt the blood of the Vikings in his veins, rest satisfied
                    with the honest confession of such a simple motive as this for his wanderings.
                    It would not have been at all in the spirit of Chateaubriand's period, nor would
                    it have been in keeping with the part he played in that period, for him to go to
                    Jerusalem to study landscape, to cover his palette with colours, and fill his
                    sketch-book with sketches. When Childe Harold talks of his pilgrimage, he
                    employs the word in its secondary meaning. Chateaubriand uses it in its original
                    meaning. He tells every one that he is going to the Holy Land to strengthen his
                    faith by the sight of all the holy places. He brings back with him water from
                    the Jordan, and when the Comte de Chambord is born it is with this water that
                    the royal infant is baptized. He himself says: »It may seem strange nowadays to
                    speak of sacred vows and pilgrimages, but in this matter, as every one knows, I
                    have no feeling of shame; I long ago took my place in the ranks of the
                    superstitious and weak-minded. I am perhaps the last Frenchman who will set out
                    for the Holy Land with the ideas, aims, and feelings of a medieval pilgrim. And
                    though I do not possess the virtues which so conspicuously distinguished the De
                    Coucys, De Nesles, De Chatillons, and De Montforts, I have at least their faith;
                    by this sign even the old crusaders would recognise me as one of
                    themselves.«</p>

                <p>There is an awkward discrepancy between this utterance <pb n="143"/> and the words quoted
                    above: »I went in quest of imagery–that was all.« And in Chateaubriand's
                    <emph>Mémoires d'outre-tombe</emph> we find a confession of yet another object in his quest
                    of pictures, which throws a curious light upon the feelings and motives of the
                    would-be pilgrim. He hoped by his efforts after fame, by his studies and his
                    travels, to win the favour of a lady with whom he was in love. Taken in itself
                    this is most natural. Chateaubriand was an ardent lover and frantically
                    ambitious. It is not surprising that he should have said to himself: Fame,
                    greater, more deserved, that I may deserve her better, that I may show her my
                    ardent desire to render myself worthy of her favour! The lady herself appears to
                    have been ambitious for him, and to have allowed him to view the possession of
                    herself as a possible, far-off reward of new efforts. Though we may acknowledge
                    that there is something medieval and chivalrous in such a relationship as this,
                    an extraordinary confusion of ideas is none the less proved in the man who talks
                    of a crusade and a pilgrimage. And yet Chateaubriand was no priestly casuist; he
                    was a haughty, self-important, cynical aristocrat, who defiantly attached the
                    colours of the church to his helmet and wore them not only at every joust but at
                    every rendezvous.</p>

                <p>In his <emph>Mémoires d'outre-tombe</emph> he writes: »But have I in my <emph>Itinéraire</emph> really
                    told everything about that voyage on which I embarked from the port of Desdemona
                    and Othello? Was it in the spirit of repentance that I sought the sepulchre of
                    Christ? <emph>One single thought</emph> consumed me; I counted the moments with impatience.
                    Standing on the deck of my ship, with my eyes fixed on the evening star, I
                    prayed for a fair wind to carry me swiftly onwards, for fame–in order that I
                    might be loved. I hoped to win fame in Sparta, at Mount Zion, at Memphis, at
                    Carthage, and to carry it with me to the Alhambra. Would another remember me
                    with as great steadfastness as mine under my probation?... If I secretly enjoy a
                    moment's happiness, it is disturbed by memories of those days of seduction, of
                    enchantment, of madness.«</p>

                <p>This is the language of a modern Tannhäuser, looking back with longing to his
                    Venusberg. Chateaubriand has evidently forgotten that he had attributed to
                    himself the <pb n="144"/> emotions and aims of a medieval pilgrim. The lady who had given him
                    a rendezvous at the Alhambra was a young Madame de Mouchy, who died insane.
                    Contemporaries represent her as a marvel of beauty, charm, and refinement.
                    Chateaubriand had been married since 1792. His marriage was undoubtedly a rash
                    and foolish one, but, as the ardent champion of Christian morality, he ought to
                    have considered himself bound by it, regardless of circumstances. In his
                    <emph>Mémoires</emph> he tells how it came about: »The negotiations were entered into
                    without my knowledge. I had not seen Mademoiselle de Lavigne more than three or
                    four times.... I did not feel myself at all fitted to be a husband. All my
                    illusions were still strong; nothing was exhausted in me; the vigour of life had
                    been redoubled in me by my travels. I was constantly tormented by my muse. My
                    sister had a high opinion of Mademoiselle de Lavigne, and saw in this marriage
                    an independent position for me. Arrange it, then, said I. As a public man I am
                    not to be influenced, but in private life I am the prey of any one that chooses
                    to take possession of me; to avoid an hour's annoyance I could let myself be
                    made a slave for half a century.« Fortunately, he did not feel himself a
                    slave.</p>

                <p>In the rôle of the returned pilgrim, then, he wrote his epic. An epic in the
                    nineteenth century! In our days no one believes in the possibility of such a
                    thing. A clearer comprehension than that possessed by any former age of the
                    historical conditions which went to the production of the great national epics
                    of antiquity has convinced us of the vanity of endeavouring in modern times to
                    rival works of the freshness of the <emph>Iliad</emph> or the naïveté (in spite of a high
                    degree of culture) of the <emph>Odyssey</emph>. Just as little as it would occur to any
                    real poet to-day to imitate the <emph>Vedas</emph>, the <emph>Psalms of David</emph>, or the
                    <emph>Voluspa</emph>, would it occur to him to attempt to compete with the immortal works
                    in which, late in the morning of their days, nations, childlike and yet mature,
                    have told the story of their gods and of their heroes–as the Greeks have done
                    in their national epics, the Germans in the <emph>Nibelungenlied</emph>, and the Finns in
                    <emph>Kalevala</emph>. The epics which, like Virgil's and Tasso's, Camoens', Klopstock's,
                    and Voltaire's, are con<pb n="145"/>scious, laboured imitations of these old popular works,
                    and which have transformed the miraculous element in them into dead epic
                    machinery, have never taken rank with their models; their comparative value
                    depends upon how close, in time and in spirit, they are to these models. The
                    more naïveté they display, the colder they leave us. The epic poems written in
                    modern times which have not been failures–Goethe's <emph>Hermann und Dorothea</emph>, or
                    Mickiewicz's <emph>Herr (Pan) Tadeusz</emph>–have entirely dispensed with the
                    appurtenances of the old epic. But this Chateaubriand had not the slightest
                    intention of doing. Far from it–he rather meant to add to their number, in
                    order to exhibit the vast superiority of the Christian to the antique
                    apparatus.</p>

                <p>As he has no command of verse, he determines to write his epic in prose; but,
                    great master of prose as he is, we know in anticipation how he will grope after
                    a style. And we are sensible, as we read, of a confusion of influences–Homer,
                    the Revelation of St. John, Dante and Milton, the Fathers of the Church and
                    Suetonius. The action takes place in the days of Diocletian; one half of the
                    characters are pagans, the other half Christians. The hero, Eudore, wins the
                    heart of a young pagan girl; he converts her, and they die together as martyrs
                    in the arena of the Colosseum. Her father is a Greek priest of the Homeric gods.
                    Some of the events happen in ancient Gaul.</p>

                <p>His imitation of the Homeric style has led the author into much artificiality and
                    exaggeration. In the first place he has made his Greeks too religious. They show
                    the same childlike faith in their gods as do those Homeric heroes from whom they
                    are separated by the space of eleven centuries. The Greeks of the age of Eudore
                    were for the most part confirmed sceptics, and those who still believed in their
                    gods did it in a rationalistic manner. Chateaubriand's Greek maiden comes upon
                    Eudore in the forest, while he is resting under a tree. He is young and
                    handsome. He rises hurriedly when he sees her. »Are not you the hunter
                    Endymion?« she stammers confusedly. »And you,« asks the young man in his turn,
                    »are not you an angel?« These are not simply polite speeches; the speakers mean
                    what they say. In Chateau<pb n="146"/>briand's pages it is the most simple matter possible
                    for two lovers living in the most enlightened country in the world to take each
                    other for legendary characters and supernatural beings. Cymodocée's father says
                    in the same style to the young man: »Prithee, my guest, forgive my frankness; I
                    have ever yielded obedience to truth, <emph>the daughter of Saturn</emph> and the mother of
                    virtue.« Even as far back as the days of Plato a Greek was perfectly capable of
                    naming truth without mentioning either its parents or the grandparents of
                    virtue.</p>

                <p>We come upon phrases which might have been translated from Homer. When Cymodocée
                    wants to find out who Eudore is, she says: »In what harbours has your ship cast
                    anchor? Do you come from Tyre, famed for the wealth of its merchants? or from
                    beautiful Corinth, after receiving precious gifts from your hosts?« &amp;c.</p>

                <p>This sort of thing is passable in dialogue, but the effect is distressing when
                    the narrator himself either altogether forgets the 1500 years which separate him
                    from the characters of the story, and writes as they speak, or else employs
                    expressions borrowed from the medieval romances of chivalry. He writes, for
                    instance, in Homeric style: Nothing would have disturbed the happiness of
                    Démodocus, if he could only have found a husband for his daughter who would have
                    treated her with proper consideration <emph>after leading her home to a house full of
                    treasures</emph>. And of Velléda, the Gallican Druidess, we are told, in the true
                    ballad style: <emph>Fille de roi a moins de beauté, de noblesse et de grandeur</emph>.</p>

                <p>And if the author sometimes writes as if he himself were the last of the
                    Homeridæ, his characters in retaliation often talk as if they foresaw the whole
                    course of modern intellectual development. The Christian bishop, Cyrille,
                    speaking of the heathen myths, says: »A time will perhaps come when these
                    falsehoods of the childish days of old will simply be ingenious fables, themes
                    for the song of the poet. But in our days they confuse men's minds.« What an
                    enlightened man!</p>

                <p>It is unnecessary to pass the whole work in review. The author's great ability is
                    only displayed in details and incidental episodes. One beautiful passage is that
                    in which he describes the arrival of the Greek family to visit the Christian <pb n="147"/> family, who are all in the field, binding sheaves; it has a peculiar, idyllic
                    charm which recalls the Book of Ruth, and yet it breathes the New Testament
                    spirit. The account of Velléda's death is also very fine. There is all the fire
                    and divine frenzy of Chateaubriand, the poet's, genius in his representation of
                    Velléda.</p>

                <p>There are longer passages than these well worthy of attention, such as the
                    description of the battle between the Franks and the combined armies of the
                    Romans and the Gauls, which, written as it was a number of years before Sir
                    Walter Scott's historical novels, is significant and novel with its element of
                    national characterisation. As in all Chateaubriand's works, the descriptions of
                    nature are fine.</p>

                <p>It ought to be observed that when, in his <emph>Memoirs</emph>, Chateaubriand himself has
                    occasion to write of <emph>Les Martyrs</emph>, he does so with proud modesty; he shows that
                    he is conscious of the faultiness of the work in certain respects, and draws
                    particular attention to the small degree of success it has had in comparison
                    with <emph>Le Génie du Christianisme</emph>. He ascribes the comparatively unfavourable
                    reception which it met with at first principally to outward circumstances; and
                    in this he is right. Napoleon's relations with the Pope were at that moment
                    strained and unfriendly. What Chateaubriand had written of Diocletian as the
                    persecutor of the Christians was applied to the Emperor. There were allusions to
                    the humble circumstances of Napoleon's youth and to his insatiable ambition in
                    the description of Galerius, and allusions to his court in the description of
                    Diocletian's.</p>

                <p>Hence <emph>Les Martyrs</emph> was not supported and circulated by the Government, as
                    Chateaubriand's first work had been. And the clergy, with the Bishop of Chartres
                    at their head, did not consider the book sufficiently orthodox; they discovered
                    heresies in it. But in the end, in spite of everything, it made its way. Four
                    editions were sold in a few years.</p>

                <p>What Chateaubriand desired to prove by means of this work was the peculiar
                    adaptability of the Christian legend, of Christian supernaturalism, to the use
                    of the poet. What he succeeded in proving was that in our days orthodox <pb n="148"/> Christian poetry comes centuries too late. The poets who have dealt with
                    supernatural themes have as a rule been more successful in their representations
                    of hell than in their descriptions of the state of the blessed. In Dante a
                    perfect host of bold figures, so powerfully conceived that they dominate the
                    whole poem, emerge from the waters and the flames of perdition. Amongst the
                    damned of the Inferno those whom we remember best are the almost superhumanly
                    defiant and proud Italian nobles of the poet's own day–Farinata, for example.
                    As to Milton, his Satan is universally acknowledged to be his most masterly
                    character; and it has been maintained, not without reason, that the prototype of
                    this character is to be sought among those energetic Puritan rebels who, even
                    when they were overcome, did not cease to defy the royal authority. Each age
                    paints its Lucifer in its own image. Chateaubriand's rebellious spirit is not
                    the traditional devil either, but a devil who has brought about the French
                    Revolution. Every time he and his attendant courtiers open their mouths it is to
                    utter one or other of the watchwords of the revolutionary period. In Satan's
                    speech to his army we are astonished to hear the echo of the oratory of 1792.
                    After a few introductory Biblical phrases he falls into the style of the hymns
                    of the Revolution, which Chateaubriand has amused himself by caricaturing.</p>

                <p>Satan says: »<emph>Dieux des nations, trônes, ardeurs, guerriers généreux, milices
                    invincibles, magnanimes enfants de cette forte patrie, le jour de gloire est
                    arrivé.«</emph></p>

                <p>French literature had progressed so far that the Marseillaise was put into the
                    mouth of the devil by the country's greatest poet.</p>

                <p>And what kind of being is he, this devil? A spark of life is communicated to him
                    by caricaturing Rouget de Lisle. But for this he is a boneless, bloodless
                    allegorical figure. Watch him descending to his kingdom. »Quicker than thought
                    he traverses space, which will one day disappear (a truly marvellous idea,
                    this!); on the farther side of the howling remains of chaos he comes to the
                    boundaries of those regions which are as imperishable as the vengeance which
                    created them–cursed regions, death's grave and <pb n="149"/> cradle, over which time has no
                    power, and which will still exist when the universe has been carried away like a
                    tent that is set up for a day; ... he follows no path through the darkness, but,
                    drawn downwards by the weight of his crimes(!), descends <emph>naturally</emph> into hell.«
                    In his kingdom he is surrounded by figures which are either purely
                    allegorical–in which case they are the funnier the more terrible the author has
                    intended them to be–or else caricatures of Voltairians and Voltaire, which, in
                    the middle of this solemn epic poem, produce the effect of scraps of ill-natured
                    newspaper articles which have found their way in by some mistake.</p>

                <p>Death is thus described: »A phantom suddenly appears upon the threshold of the
                    inexorable portals–it is Death. It shows like a dark spot against the flames of
                    the burning prison-cells behind it; its skeleton allows the livid yellow beams
                    of hell-fire to pass through the apertures between its bones.... Satan, seized
                    with horror, turns away his head to avoid the skeleton's kiss.« And here are two
                    other demons: »Bound by a hundred knots of adamant (!) to a throne of bronze,
                    the demon of Despair sits ruling the empire of Sorrow.... At the entrance of the
                    first vestibule the Eternity of Sufferings lies stretched upon a bed of iron; he
                    is motionless; his heart does not even beat; in his hand he holds an
                    inexhaustible hour-glass. He knows and says only one word–Never.« We are
                    reminded of the automaton upon a clock, which says nothing but Cuc-koo.</p>

                <p>These demons are like nothing upon earth, but the prototypes of the demons of
                    false wisdom are unmistakable. We have seen that all the ideas of the day on the
                    subject of religion might be summed up in the one word, <emph>order</emph>. Hence in hell,
                    as well as in heaven, order is pertinaciously insisted on. Apropos of a quarrel
                    in hell we read: »A terrible conflict would have ensued if God, who is the sole
                    origin of all <emph>order</emph>, even in hell, had not reduced the brawlers to silence.«
                    And we are told of the demon of False Wisdom: »He found fault with the works of
                    the Almighty; he desired in his pride to establish another <emph>order</emph> amongst the
                    angels and in the kingdom of heavenly wisdom; it was he who became the father of
                    Atheism, that horrible spectre whom <pb n="150"/> Satan himself had not begotten, and who fell
                    in love with Death.«</p>

                <p>Curiously enough it is precisely a change of order, a change in the order of
                    precedence in the court of heaven itself, which this most hateful of all devils
                    has been attempting to make.</p>

                <p>He speaks. »The feigned severity of his voice, his apparent calmness, deceive the
                    blinded crowd: 'Monarchs of hell, ye know that I have always been opposed to
                    violence; we shall only prevail by gentleness, by argument, by persuasion. Let
                    me spread among my worshippers and among the Christians themselves those
                    principles which dissolve the ties of society and undermine the foundations of
                    empires!'«</p>

                <p>Compare with this the description of the philosophers of the day: »These
                    disciples of a vain science attack the Christians, praise a life of retirement,
                    live at the feet of the great, and ask for money. Some of them occupy themselves
                    seriously with the idea of forming a sort of Platonic commonwealth, peopled by
                    sages, who will spend their lives together as friends and brothers; others
                    meditate profoundly on the secrets of nature. Some see everything in mind,
                    others seek everything in matter; some, although they live under a monarchy,
                    preach a republic, asserting that society ought to be demolished and rebuilt
                    upon a new plan; others, in imitation of the Christians, attempt to teach the
                    people morality. Divided as regards what is good, of one accord in all that is
                    evil, swollen with vanity, taking themselves for great geniuses, these sophists
                    invent all manner of extraordinary notions and systems. At their head is
                    Hieroclos, a man worthy to be the leader of such a battalion.... There is
                    something cynical and shameless in his face; it is easy to see how unfit his
                    ignoble hands are to wield the sword of the soldier, how fit to handle the pen
                    of the atheist or the sword of the executioner.«</p>

                <p>These assertions are made of Rome and of Hieroclos, but Paris and Voltaire are so
                    plainly indicated that proof is unnecessary.</p>

                <p>French literature had now come the length of representing Voltaire, the man who
                    time after time struck the sword <pb n="151"/> out of the hands of the Catholic executioners
                    and extinguished the flames in which they were preparing to burn innocent
                    victims, as a man specially cut out for the trade of executioner. And so
                    careless had the champions of orthodoxy become that they forgot his obstinate
                    faith in God, and, desiring to paint the devil as black as possible, represented
                    him as an atheist. Now, whatever else Satan and his comrades may be, they
                    neither are nor can be atheists.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">

                <p>Let us turn from Chateaubriand's hell to his Paradise. It is always difficult to
                    describe heaven. We all know what hell is, but when heaven is in question a
                    certain feeling of embarrassment comes over us. Information is scarce, as a
                    French lady said. And to describe it was doubly difficult at the time when
                    Parny, in his <emph>Guerre des Dieux</emph>, had, so to speak, produced in anticipation a
                    parody of any such attempt that might be made. Fragments of Parny's graceless
                    poem were still in all men's minds. Its best scenes, such as the arrival of the
                    Trinity at Mount Olympus, and the return visit paid in heaven by the gods, are
                    really witty, although the style, instead of corresponding to the imposing
                    title, is as smooth and polished as the paintings of »Velvet« Breughel. Yet even
                    Parny's scurrility did not make the heaven of orthodoxy as comical as it is made
                    by Chateaubriand's enthusiasm.</p>

                <p>»In the centre of the created worlds, in the midst of the innumerable stars which
                    serve as ramparts, roads and avenues, is suspended the great city of God, of
                    which no mortal tongue can tell the marvels. The Almighty himself laid its
                    twelve foundation stones, and surrounded it with that wall of jasper which the
                    beloved disciple saw the angel measuring with the golden reed. Clothed with the
                    glory of the Most High, Jerusalem is adorned like a bride for her bridegroom....
                    Richness of material vies with perfection of form. Here hang in mid-air
                    galleries of sapphires and diamonds, which the genius of man feebly imitated in
                    the gardens of Babylon. There rise triumphal arches, built of <pb n="152"/> dazzling stars.
                    Arcades of suns traverse the endless spaces of the firmament....«</p>

                <p>A native of Copenhagen is irresistibly reminded by all this of the glories of
                    »Tivoli« as they revealed themselves to his childish eyes on evenings when the
                    grounds were illuminated.</p>

                <p>We are allowed a glimpse of the interior of the holy city. Here the choirs of
                    cherubim and seraphim, angels and archangels, principalities and powers, are
                    perpetually meeting and separating. These beings, who, it would seem, had not
                    been entirely safe from ridicule, seeing that Parny had belaboured them so
                    unmercifully, now hold a new triumphal entry.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">

                    From this time onward they become regular denizens of the realm of poetry; we find the whole host assembled
                    even in De Vigny's <emph>Eloa</emph> (1823) and in Victor Hugo's <emph>Odes</emph> (livre i., ode 5,
                    ode 9, ode 10). We learn what their occupations are; »Some are the keepers of
                    the 20,000 war-chariots of Zebaoth and Elohim, others guard the quivers of the
                    Lord, his deadly thunderbolts, and the terrible horses which are the carriers of
                    pestilence, war, famine, and death. One million of these ardent beings order the
                    courses of the stars, relieving each other in this glorious occupation like the
                    vigilant sentinels of a great army.« In Parny's poem their occupation is less
                    arduous. The duty he assigns to them, because of their limited intelligence, is
                    principally that of acting as decorations. They stand in rows along the walls
                    and look on.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">

                <p><pb n="153"/> All the things which Chateaubriand's angels guard lie, as it were, in a great
                    arsenal ready for use on given occasions. In the following description we see
                    them in use. The occasion is the proclamation by the Trinity to the blessed
                    saints of Eudore's approaching martyrdom: »When these vicissitudes of the church
                    had been communicated to the elect by a single word of the Almighty, there was
                    silence in heaven for the space of half-an-hour. All the celestial beings cast
                    their eyes to the ground. From the heights of heaven Mary let a first look of
                    love fall upon the poor victim confided to her tender care. The palms of the
                    confessors grew green again in their hands. The glorious squadron opened its
                    ranks to make room for the new martyrs.« Michael, the dragon-slayer, shoulders
                    his redoubtable spear; his deathless comrades don shining cuirasses; diamond and
                    golden shields, the quivers of the Lord, and the flaming swords are taken down
                    from the vaulted roof of heaven; the wheels of the chariot of Immanuel turn upon
                    their axles of fire and lightning; the cherubim spread their rushing wings, »<emph>et
                    allument la fureur de leurs yeux</emph>.« This is half masquerade, half ballet.</p>

                <p>But let us pass from these adjuncts to bliss itself. We find it thus described:
                    »The chief happiness of the elect lies in the consciousness that their bliss is
                    boundless; they experience for ever the delectable feelings of the mortal who
                    has just done a virtuous or heroic deed, or of the genius in the act of
                    conceiving a great idea, or of the man enjoying the delights of legitimate (!)
                    love or of a friendship tried by long misfortune. The grandeur and the
                    omnipotence of the Almighty are the constant theme of their discourse. 'O God,'
                    they cry, 'how great Thou art!'«</p>

                <p>Chateaubriand has not succeeded in making heavenly bliss particularly attractive.
                    Our first feeling is apt to be one of pity for the unfortunate Deity thus
                    compelled eternally to listen to his own praises. He is thus described: »Far
                    from the eyes of the angels is accomplished the mystery of the Trinity. The
                    Spirit which mounts and descends perpetually from the Son to the Father and from
                    the Father to the Son unites itself with them in these un<pb n="154"/>fathomable depths. A
                    triangle of fire appears at the entrance to the Holy of Holies. The awe-stricken
                    spheres stop in their courses, the hosannas of the angels are silenced.... The
                    fiery triangle disappears, the sanctuary opens, and the three Potentates are
                    seen. The Father sits upon a throne of clouds, a compass in his hands, a sphere
                    beneath his feet; on his right hand sits the Son, armed with lightnings; on the
                    left the Holy Spirit rises like a pillar of fire. Jehovah gives a sign, and
                    time, reassured, continues its course.«</p>

                <p>We are not informed how many times in the day, week, or month this magnificent
                    ceremony takes place. Possibly it is in the intervals of these accomplishments
                    of the mystery of the Trinity that the Divine Being divides itself, for at times
                    it appears to be divided: »Appealed to by the God of mercy and peace on behalf
                    of the threatened church, the mighty and terrible God made known his plans to
                    the assembled hosts of heaven.«<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">

                <p>On ordinary occasions the Son sits at a mystic table, and four and twenty elders,
                    clothed in white, with crowns of gold on their heads, sit upon thrones by his
                    side. Close by stands his living chariot, the wheels of which emit fire. When
                    the Expected of the Nations deigns to vouchsafe a perfect vision of himself to
                    the elect, they fall down before him as if dead; but he stretches forth his
                    right hand and says to them: »Rise, ye blessed of my Father! Look upon me. I am
                    the First and the Last!«</p>

                <p>We feel as if this performance must lose much of its impressiveness by
                    repetition.</p>

                <p><pb n="155"/> As an example of the supernaturalness of this heaven, it may be mentioned that
                    the raiment of the holy elders is made <emph>white</emph> in the blood of the Lamb. That it
                    is a modern production we observe from the fact that, in spite of the remarkable
                    arbitrariness which prevails, its author has not escaped the influence of the
                    spirit of his day, for even in this heaven we hear of laws of nature. We are
                    told of the blessed that they desire to comprehend the laws which explain the
                    easy flight of heavy bodies through the ether. This is a sort of anticipation of
                    the standpoint in Byron's <emph>Cain</emph>.</p>

                <p>From the artistic point of view it is interesting to observe the kind of imagery
                    by means of which Chateaubriand, when he is neither borrowing from the
                    Revelation of St. John nor from Milton, attempts to give an idea of the glories
                    of heaven. When Dante makes the same attempt, he has recourse to visions, to the
                    glories of that mystic rose which the Gothic cathedral builders feebly
                    endeavoured to imitate; but Chateaubriand, the man of modern ideas and of much
                    experience as far as the outward world is concerned, has recourse to impressions
                    of travel. The arcades of heaven are compared to the gardens of Babylon, to the
                    pillars of Palmyra in the sands of the desert. When the blessed spirits are
                    hastening through the created world we are told of the scene that displays
                    itself to them: »Thus present themselves to the eye of the traveller the great
                    plains of India, the fertile valleys of Delhi and Kashmir, shores covered with
                    pearls and fragrant with ambergris, where the tranquil waves lay themselves to
                    rest beneath the blossoming cinnamon trees.« Such imagery is somewhat too
                    realistic for the spiritual theme. We shrink from representing all these
                    archangels to ourselves in Indian surroundings. But it is in such ways that
                    nature revenges herself upon the man who believes he can set her aside or can
                    produce something superior to her productions. A later author of this same
                    school, De Vigny, who writes as much under the influence of Ossian as of Milton,
                    compares the ether of the firmament to the mists of the Scottish mountains. The
                    indistinct form of Lucifer descried far off in <pb n="156"/> space by the angel Eloa is
                    compared to the waving plaid of some wandering Scotchwoman, seen through the
                    misty clouds falling on the hill-tops. The conjunction of an angel and a plaid
                    strikes us as a curious one.</p>

                <p>The scenery which this group of authors considers unquestionably the most
                    beautiful is not the jumbled, potpourri landscape of the German Romanticists;
                    no, what they, in harmony with the spirit of their day, admire is that
                    Paradisaic landscape in which the strictest order prevails–symmetrical,
                    architectural, a sort of dilution of Claude Lorraine. Take, for an example, the
                    commencement of De Vigny's <emph>Le Déluge</emph>:</p>

                <p>This partiality for model, ideal landscape tempts our authors more and more
                    frequently to lay the scenes of their works in heaven.</p>

                <p>Chateaubriand continues to be a greater master in the description of earthly than
                    of heavenly surroundings.</p>

                <p>The action of De Vigny's earliest poems takes place, in genuine Seraphic style,
                    midway between heaven and earth.</p>

                    familiar imagery:</p>

                <p>Though Lamartine in his first works lingers lovingly over terrestrial scenes, he
                    yet constantly soars in hymns into the celestial ether where, as he tells us,
                    sacred poetry dwells, crowned with palms and stars.</p>

                <p>Lord Byron, who, like De Vigny, writes a poem on the Flood (<emph>Heaven and Earth</emph>),
                    is also partial to ether, though not such theological ether, as a surrounding;
                    but he loves wilder scenery, and it is as the painter of the sea that he finds
                    his true sphere. He lifts poetry out of its ethereal environment and deposits it
                    in the fresh, salt element.</p>

                <p>Chateaubriand, then, hardly succeeded in proving what he wished to prove, the
                    superiority of Christianity to the purely human sources of poetic inspiration.
                    Each time he attempts to do so he exposes or condemns himself. I adduce one
                    other striking example of this.</p>

                <p>His hero, Eudore, sailing up the Gulf of Megara, with Ægina in front of him,
                    Piræus on the right and Corinth on the left, sees all these towns, which once
                    were so flourishing, lying in ruins. A Greek fellow-passenger is moved to tears
                    by the remembrance of his country's ancient glory, and we are told in touching
                    words how the individual feels as if his individual griefs disappeared when he
                    is brought face to face with the great, overwhelming calamities which crush
                    whole nations. Then Eudore says: »Such an idea seemed to be beyond my youthful
                    grasp, and nevertheless I understood it, whilst the other young men who were on
                    board did not. What caused this difference between us? Our religions. They were
                    pagans, I was a Christian.«</p>

                <p>Chateaubriand plainly desires to impress upon us that such an appreciation of
                    natural surroundings and the lessons taught by them is a special possession of
                    the Christian, of which the pagan, as pagan, is destitute. But his position is
                    con<pb n="158"/>siderably weakened by our knowledge that the utterance referred to by Eudore
                    is nothing more nor less than a translation from a famous letter written by
                    Sulpicius to Cicero,<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom"><emph>Ad familiares</emph>, lib. iv. Epist. 5.</note> that the sentiments in question are actually the
                    sentiments of a pagan. We can hardly be expected to accept this as a proof of
                    the pagan's want of poetic feeling. But the trait is typical. Throughout all
                    Chateaubriand's writings dogmatic religion is constantly proclaimed to be in
                    possession of certain supernatural beauties and qualities of which nature, as
                    nature, is devoid; and yet everything in that religion which is of poetical or
                    moral value is simply an expression of human nature. As Feuerbach puts it:
                    »Every theory of God is, in its essence, a theory of human nature.«</p>

                <p>Passing this half audacious, half conventional work, <emph>Les Martyrs</emph>, once again in
                    review, we cannot deny that the part of it which directly treats of the
                    supernatural world of Christianity is a failure. Indeed, Chateaubriand himself
                    openly confesses as much in his <emph>Memoirs</emph>. The parts which have any real value
                    are the purely human parts, one of which we shall presently criticise. It was
                    inevitable that the doubt and indifference of the century concerning the
                    supernatural world should set its mark on the work of an author whose own
                    religious enthusiasm was as much a matter of deliberate intention and
                    determination as Chateaubriand's.</p>

                <p>Chateaubriand was not a conscious hypocrite, but he deceived himself. Proof of
                    the manner in which he himself was affected by the reading of his <emph>Martyrs</emph> is
                    to be found in that refined and charming autobiographical work, which all agree
                    in accepting as reliable–<emph>Les Enchantements de Prudence</emph>, by Madame de Saman,
                    otherwise Madame Allart de Méritens, the last woman whom Chateaubriand loved,
                    and who loved him in return.</p>

                <p>This lady tells how, in the summer of 1828, they used to meet at the Pont
                    d'Austerlitz and dine together in the Jardin des Plantes in a private room. »He
                    ordered champagne, to dispel my coldness, as he said; and then I sang to him
                    Béranger's songs–<emph>Mon âme, La bonne vieille. Le Dieu des bonnes gens</emph>, &amp;c.
                    He listened as if enchanted.« She <pb n="159"/> paints these meetings in the warmest
                    colours,<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">»In this condition he was more enamoured, more vivacious; he told me that I
                        gave him the most rapturous pleasure, called me a seductress, &amp;c, and in
                        that secluded place did what he pleased« (Madame de Saman, <emph>Les Enchantements de
                            Prudence. Avec préface de George Sand</emph>, 1873, pp. 166, &amp;c).</note> and she mentions that it was one of Chateaubriand's greatest
                    pleasures to listen to her reading passages from his works. (Both in this book
                    and elsewhere Madame de Saman shows herself to have been possessed of excellent
                    literary taste.) He especially loved to hear her read his descriptions of
                    landscape. »But sometimes,« she says, »to affect him more profoundly, I produced
                    <emph>Les Martyrs</emph>, and read the speeches and thanksgiving hymns of the confessors,
                    or the thrilling prison and torture-chamber scenes. Then he could not restrain
                    his tears. One day he began to weep; I continued to read; he sobbed
                    convulsively; I still went on, and when I came to the passage which tells how
                    Eudore secretly offered to sacrifice himself in order to win the salvation of
                    his mother, who had been too weak in her love for her children, he could contain
                    himself no longer, and burst into a passion of tears and sobs. It was a case of
                    emotions returning to their source. His highly strung nerves gave way.
                    Completely overcome, exhausted with weeping, he expressed his gratitude to me,
                    said that he had never experienced such rapture, called me by all the sweet
                    names men give to the Muses, told me that I was beautiful, more especially
                    praised my eyes and their expression, imagining in the ardour of his passion
                    that he had never seen anything like them before.« The lady was at this time
                    about twenty, Chateaubriand exactly sixty years old.</p>

                <p>This quotation shows us that even such frigid passages in <emph>Les Martyrs</emph> as the
                    speeches of the white-robed elders had really been <emph>felt</emph> by the author himself.
                    We are touched by this young and noble woman's enthusiastic admiration for an
                    old man, and the man himself rises in the reader's estimation from the fact of
                    his being able, even at that age, to win the love of such a woman. But it is in
                    strange surroundings that we come upon this outburst of strong emotion, a thing
                    so rare with Chateaubriand that it may almost be called unique. <pb n="160"/> Champagne, the
                    songs of his political and religious opponent, Béranger, caresses and
                    declarations of love, fits of weeping and sobbing over <emph>Les Martyrs</emph>, followed
                    by more love-making! What an environment for the epic of orthodoxy! What an
                    excess of human passion in a Seraphic poet, a former minister of state and
                    pilgrim to Jerusalem!<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Chateaubriand, <emph>Les Martyrs</emph>, more particularly books iii. and viii.;
                        <emph>Mémoires d'outre-tombe</emph>; Sainte-Beuve, <emph>Chateaubriand et son groupe littéraire

                <p><emph>Les Martyrs</emph> shows Chateaubriand's weakest side as an author. Such a scene as
                    that described with the best intentions by Madame Allart de Méritens shows his
                    weakest side as a man. And yet this outburst of human passion makes almost a
                    satisfactory impression upon us compared with the artificiality by which he is
                    so often distinguished. God and the king are too constantly in his mouth. We
                    must not, however, allow this artificiality to blind us to what is really great
                    in the talent and in the life of this remarkable personage.</p>

                <p>In order to get a complete impression of Chateaubriand it is necessary to read
                    the twelve volumes of <emph>Mémoires d'outre-tombe</emph>, as also those by which they are
                    supplemented. Just as Rousseau's <emph>Confessions</emph> form the most interesting of his
                    books, so the <emph>Mémoires</emph> constitute Chateaubriand's most impressive work. In
                    them we find a complete personality–a whole man, and that a man of mark. This
                    important personage, who possesses no great acuteness of observation as far as
                    humanity in general is concerned, who, in fact, occupies himself very little
                    with humanity in general, has focussed all his acuteness upon the one subject
                    which really interests him, his own ego, and has half consciously, half
                    unconsciously, but in any case very completely, revealed and exhibited it to us.
                    It is an ego proud to the verge of arrogance, melancholy to the verge of
                    despondency, sceptical to the verge of indifference, without faith in progress
                    of any kind, profoundly persuaded of the vanity of even those things which
                    afford it temporary pleasure, such as love, fame, worldly position, and, as time
                    goes on, ever more saturated with ennui and ever more absorbingly occupied with
                    itself. It is an ego which owns a <pb n="161"/> warm, prolific imagination and great artistic
                    talent, and which, at a period (the end of the eighteenth century) when taste
                    was all in favour of the light, the pretty, the small, felt itself solitary in
                    its love of the grand, of the beauty of magnitude.</p>

                <p>In a certain sense Chateaubriand was like no other man of his day. He satisfied,
                    as we saw, the requirement of the moment so exactly with his <emph>Génie du
                    Christianisme</emph> that, as a sort of intellectual standard-bearer, he acquired an
                    importance out of proportion to his character and talent.</p>

                <p>In so far the moment at which he made his appearance magnified him.</p>

                <p>But, looking at the matter from the other side, it may be maintained with equal
                    certainty that the moment at which he entered upon his career forced on him a
                    part which, for half a century, brought him into conflict with his own inmost
                    nature. That nature was always rebelling against the part; the man's
                    independence and uncontrollableness were in perpetual collision with the
                    politico-religious orthodoxy which it had become his life-task to give
                    expression to and champion. In other words, his position in the world involved
                    him in incurable discord with himself.</p>

                <p>In his old age he sometimes plainly confesses this. Towards the conclusion of his
                    work on the congress of Verona he says openly: »As an officer of the regiment of
                    Navarre I had come back from the forests of America to join legitimate monarchy
                    in its exile and to fight under its banner <emph>against my own judgment</emph> (contre mes
                    propres lumières)–<emph>all this without conviction</emph>, simply from a soldier's sense
                    of duty, and because I, having had the honour of driving in the royal carriages
                    from and to Versailles, considered myself peculiarly bound to support a prince
                    of the blood royal.«<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom"><emph>Congrès de Vérone</emph>, ii. 527.</note> We find him, however, only two pages farther on in the
                    same book ascribing the fortunate issue of the war in Spain, which he had forced
                    on against the desire of France, Spain, and England, less to his own ability,
                    which he is not at all given to undervaluing, than to »one of the latest
                    miracles performed by Heaven for the race of St. Louis.«</p>

                <p><pb n="162"/> Here, as in all his later works, he makes a marked difference between monarchy as
                    an idea and the person of the monarch. He tries to reconcile avowed, unaltered
                    loyalty to ideas with a frank contempt for the capacities and characters of
                    kings.</p>

                <p>There is no doubt that the foolish ingratitude of the Bourbons towards the man to
                    whom they owed so much added largely to this contempt. But in his Memoirs he
                    shows that it began early; he would have us believe that it dated from his
                    earliest acquaintance with Louis XVIII, and his environment. He soon perceived
                    that King Louis did not favour him, and it wounded his pride to find that the
                    King's brother, the future Charles X., had not read one of his books, not even
                    <emph>Le Génie du Christianisme</emph>. Looking back on his past life he writes: »Louis the
                    Eighteenth and his brother did not understand me at all. The latter said of me:
                    'Good-hearted and hot-headed!' These hackneyed words ... were completely
                    misapplied. My head is very cool, and my heart has never beat very warmly for
                    kings.«</p>

                <p>The old monarchy, unless it actually felt itself so self-dependent as to be
                    indebted to no one, was bound to regard itself as under obligation to
                    Chateaubriand, not only because, as an officer in Condé's army, he had fought
                    and suffered in its cause, not only because, under Napoleon, he had stopped
                    midway in his career and defied the mighty potentate by sending in his
                    resignation after the execution of the Duke of Enghien, but also because, in
                    1814, even before Napoleon's abdication at Versailles, he had influenced public
                    opinion in favour of the Bourbons by means of a pamphlet which Louis XVIII
                    himself declared to have been as useful to him as a hundred thousand
                    soldiers.</p>

                <p>The pamphlet in question, <emph>Buonaparte et les Bourbons</emph>, is perhaps the most
                    passionate, most vindictive, most venomous, and most artificially enthusiastic
                    party work written by Chateaubriand. It is an insane shriek of hatred of the
                    fallen Napoleon, who is stripped of every fragment of his glory, and a hurrah of
                    hollow enthusiasm for sunken-chested Louis XVIII, who is deified. In no other
                    work does Chateaubriand display so much vindictive stupidity. He goes so far <pb n="163"/> as
                    to deny Bonaparte's ability as a general. He describes him as an incompetent
                    officer, who could do nothing but command his troops to go forward, and who
                    gained his victories simply by the excellence of these troops and not by his
                    conduct of them, as a commander who never ensured and never knew when to make a
                    retreat, and who, far from improving the art of war, led it back to its infancy
                    again.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom"><emph>Buonaparte et les Bourbons</emph>, pp. 36, 37.</note> The Marquise de Seiglière in Sandeau's famous comedy does not talk
                    greater nonsense about Napoleon.</p>

                <p>Louis XVIII, on the other hand, is called a prince famed for his sagacity. We are
                    told that, of all the rulers possible for France at the moment, he is the one
                    most suited to the position of the country and the <emph>spirit of the century</emph>,
                    whilst Bonaparte is the one of all others least fit to reign.</p>

                <p>This is what we find in the official pamphlet. But how differently Chateaubriand
                    thinks and speaks in his Memoirs! In them he does justice to Bonaparte's
                    military skill; he says of him that »he invented war in the grand style;« and he
                    has also suddenly discovered that the winning of one battle after another is no
                    inconsiderable part of the duty of a general. Because they flatter his own
                    vanity, he relates various anecdotes which show how Napoleon, unbiassed by his
                    (Chateaubriand's) hatred, displayed his appreciation of him. After Chateaubriand
                    had turned against him, Napoleon demanded to be informed by the Academy, why a
                    prize had not been awarded to the <emph>Génie du Christianisme</emph>. And when (at
                    Fontainebleau) he had read with perfect calmness the offensive pamphlet
                    described above, he merely remarked: »<emph>This</emph> is correct; <emph>that</emph> is not correct.
                    I do not blame Chateaubriand. He was my enemy in my day of prosperity; but those
                    miscreants,« &amp;c, &amp;c. Apropos of this, Chateaubriand makes the amusing
                    and surprising remark: »My admiration of Bonaparte (this time without the <emph>u</emph>)
                    has always been great and sincere.« He is undoubtedly telling the truth. He
                    admired and envied Napoleon. He measured himself with him and felt the
                    disadvantage of having such a contemporary.</p>

                <p><pb n="164"/> In his Memoirs he also tells the truth about those kings for whom he professed
                    such loyalty and reverence.</p>

                <p>He tells that in 1814 he dreaded the impression likely to be produced by Louis
                    XVIII's personal appearance, and he gives a copy of the high-flown description
                    which he in consequence circulated of the King's entry into Paris, a description
                    which he wrote, he says, without being asked to do so, and without any taste for
                    such compositions, but <emph>beautifying everything with the aid of the Muses</emph>. »A
                    man makes his appearance before the officers, who have never seen him, before
                    the grenadiers, who hardly know him by name. Who is this man? He is the King!
                    One and all fall down at his feet.«</p>

                <p>Then he tells the real facts of the entrance, and calmly remarks: <emph>I lied with
                    regard to the soldiers</emph>. He gives a fine description of the attitude of the
                    remnant of Napoleon's Old Guard, who were drawn up outside Notre Dame, and
                    through whose ranks the King had to pass. »I do not believe that human
                    countenances ever wore a more terrible and threatening expression.« He declares
                    that they looked as if they were on the point of cutting the King to pieces.</p>

                <p>And he makes no endeavour to show the baselessness of their contempt. After
                    telling how his plan of defence during the Hundred Days was foiled by the
                    cowardliness of the King and his immediate following, he exclaims: »Why did I
                    come into the world <emph>in an age in which I am so out of place?</emph> Why have I been a
                    Royalist <emph>against my instinct</emph> at a time when a miserable tribe of courtiers
                    would not listen to me, could not understand me? Why was my lot cast amongst
                    that crowd of mediocrities who looked on me as a madman when I spoke of courage,
                    as a revolutionist when I spoke of liberty?«<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom"><emph>Mémoires d'outre-tombe</emph>, 1849, iv. 452, &amp;c, vi. I, &amp;c.</note></p>

                <p>As the Memoirs advance, the champion of monarchy throws ever more light upon the
                    piety, understanding, and character of Louis XVIII. »It is to be feared that to<emph>
                    the most Christian King's</emph> religion was no more than a medicinal liquor, well
                    adapted to form one of the ingredients of the brew called monarchy.« He writes
                    of »the voluptuous imagina<pb n="165"/>tion which the King had inherited from his father.« He
                    remarks that he was fond of praising himself and making fun of himself at the
                    same time; for instance, when speaking of possible heirs to the throne, »he drew
                    himself up with a capable, arch air; but it was not my intention to dispute the
                    King's ability in this or any other matter.«<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">»Et il se rengorgea d'un air capable et goguenard; mais je ne prétendais
                        disputer au Roi aucune puissance.«</note> When giving a more minute
                    description of Louis's character, he says: »Selfish and devoid of prejudices, it
                    was his aim to preserve his own tranquillity at all costs.... Without being
                    cruel, the King was inhuman.« He tells how Louis boasted of being able to raise
                    a favourite so high as to make him the object of universal envy, and thereupon
                    remarks: »To be able to raise others, one must be certain of not falling one's
                    self. But what were kings in the days of Louis XVIII.? Though they could still
                    make a man rich, it was no longer in their power to make him great. They were
                    now nothing but their favourites' bankers.«</p>

                <p>And not content even with such severe language as this, Chateaubriand at times
                    takes to satire. In his account of the Congress of Verona he tells how it came
                    about that he at one time stood so high in the King's favour that his
                    fellow-ministers were positively jealous of him: »The King often went to sleep
                    in the Cabinet Council; and it was the best thing he could do, for when he was
                    not asleep he told stories. He had a great gift of mimicry. But this did not
                    amuse M. de Villèle, who wished to discuss affairs of state. M. de Corcière put
                    his elbows, his snuffbox, and his blue pocket-handkerchief on the table; the
                    other ministers listened in silence. I alone could not help being amused by His
                    Majesty's anecdotes, and this evidently delighted him. When he was searching for
                    an excuse to tell a story, he would say in his little thin, clear voice: 'I want
                    to make M. de Chateaubriand laugh.'«<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom"><emph>Mémoires d'outre-tombe</emph>, viii. 216, 222; <emph>Congrès de Vérone</emph>, i. 172, ii.
                        525.</note></p>

                <p>It does not surprise us that Chateaubriand, after demonstrating how in a
                    democratic community men make their way by talking volubly of liberty, the
                    progress of <pb n="166"/> humanity, the future, &amp;c, should wind up with the following
                    description of the conditions prevailing in the aristocratic, royalist society,
                    the praises of which he had always sung: »Play whist, bring out with an air of
                    seriousness and profundity the impertinences and witticisms which you have
                    prepared, and the brilliant career of your genius is assured.«</p>

                <p>Thus completely was the man who inaugurates the half-beliefs, the æsthetic
                    Christianity, and the affected royalism of the nineteenth century cured of all
                    illusions.</p>

                <p>He was too proud to wear his mask to the end, and he threw it off completely
                    »beyond the grave.«</p>

                <p>He himself names as his »chief faults« ennui, disgust with everything, and
                    constant doubt. These faults had their good sides. Profound indifference to all
                    this world has to bestow preserved him from the temptations of base ambition;
                    doubt preserved him from placing implicit confidence in the doctrines which a
                    spirit of aristocratic defiance more than anything else led him to champion; his
                    pride sustained him, and though it did not preserve him from hypocrisy, it kept
                    him from ever committing a mean action. But, until the ingratitude of the
                    authority which he had reinstated roused him to rebellion, there was a hopeless
                    discord between his nature and the part he played.</p>

                <head><pb n="[168]"/> VIII. MADAME DE KRÜDENER</head>

                <p>Amongst the personages of the day we come upon one class peculiarly
                    characteristic of this period, namely, the converts. In an anxiously religious
                    age following upon one of little faith this class was inevitably a numerous one.
                    Laharpe's conversion during the very course of the Revolution had excited much
                    attention. Chateaubriand himself was a convert. It is possibly the converts who
                    help us to the clearest understanding of the nature of the new spirit, for in
                    them we see it striving with and overcoming the old. The convert is, moreover,
                    always ardent; he is full of his new belief, and consequently has, or affects, a
                    peculiarly expressive countenance. The rule that the spirit of a period mirrors
                    itself typically in that period's leading characters holds doubly good in the
                    case of the individual whose character it is to be converted, especially if that
                    individual is a woman. History contains no record of a woman, with her receptive
                    nature, having led her age onward to new development, but some woman generally
                    presents us with a specially marked type of the character of her age. The
                    <emph>émigrés</emph> group themselves round Madame de Staël, the leaders of Romanticism
                    rally round Caroline Schlegel, and the age of the rehabilitation of religion
                    finds poetically pious expression in Madame de Krüdener.</p>

                <p>In Madame de Staël's <emph>Delphine</emph> there is a scene in which the heroine enchants a
                    large company with her graceful and expressive performance of a certain foreign
                    dance, the shawl-dance. This scene had a foundation of reality. Her beautiful
                    dancing was one of the many things for which the young and charming Baroness de
                    Krüdener was remarkable. In <emph>Delphine</emph> we read: »Never did grace and beauty
                    produce <pb n="168"/> a more remarkable effect upon a numerous assembly. This foreign dance
                    has a charm of which nothing we are accustomed to see can give any idea. It is
                    an altogether Asiatic mixture of indolence and vivacity, of melancholy and
                    gaiety.... Sometimes when the music became softer Delphine walked a few steps
                    with head bent and arms crossed, as if some memory or some regret had suddenly
                    intermingled itself with the joyousness of a festival; but, soon recommencing
                    her light and lively dance, she enveloped herself in an Indian shawl, which,
                    showing the contours of her figure and falling back with her long hair, made of
                    her a perfectly enchanting picture.« The word <emph>Asiatic</emph> is unmistakably the
                    characterising word. In 1803 Joubert writes of Madame de Krüdener: »She is
                    charming, with something Asiatic about her–nature exaggerated. Such extreme
                    tenderness of feeling can hardly exist without a touch of extravagance.«</p>

                <p>Julie Barbe (Juliane Barbara) de Vietinghof was born in 1764 at Riga, in Livonia.
                    Her education was conducted half on French, half on German lines. Her father was
                    a distinguished, sagacious man of the world, a philosopher and Freemason, an
                    art-lover and a Mæcenas; her mother, a sensible, conscientious woman, had been
                    brought up on strict, old-fashioned Lutheran principles. Both parents belonged
                    to the highest class of the old German-Russian aristocracy of the Baltic
                    Provinces, and were connected with the Russian court.</p>

                <p>The first teacher who made a real impression upon their young daughter, and whose
                    instructions powerfully influenced her future, was the famous Parisian
                    ballet-dancer, Vestris. At the age of eighteen Julie married Baron de Krüdener,
                    a Russian diplomatist, a man fifteen years her senior, who had already been
                    married twice, and had been divorced from both his wives. Her heart had no share
                    in this union; the match was considered an excellent one, her vanity was
                    gratified, and she had no manner of objection to her husband. He seems to have
                    been a sensible, worthy, well-educated man, cultivated and calm, by no means
                    devoid of feeling, but both by nature and from his position wedded <pb n="169"/> to all the
                    conventions of society. The Graces had not stood by his cradle.</p>

                <p>It was into the most brilliant society of the eighteenth century that Baron de
                    Krüdener introduced his wife. At the time of his marriage he was Russian envoy
                    in Kurland, and immediately after the honeymoon the couple proceeded to Mitau,
                    where Krüdener negotiated the incorporation of the Duchy with Russia, and where
                    they were honoured with a visit from the Czar (Paul I.). Amateur theatricals
                    provided the young wife with her chief occupation and interest. She went on
                    acting until almost immediately before the birth of her only son. A few weeks
                    after this event the young mother was presented to the Empress Catherine at St.
                    Petersburg. Thence Krüdener was sent as Russian ambassador to Venice; the most
                    dissipated town of the day, where his wife lived in a whirl of gaiety.</p>

                <p>In Venice a gifted young enthusiast, Alexander Stakjev, her husband's private
                    secretary, fell violently in love with Madame de Krüdener, but so great was his
                    esteem for Krüdener and for the object of his attachment that not a syllable
                    crossed his lips. So well did he preserve his secret that Krüdener took him with
                    him when he was transferred to Copenhagen in 1784. In the woods of Frederiksborg
                    Juliane and her adorer roved about admiring the beauties of nature in company.
                    It was to the husband that Stakjev at last naïvely confessed his passion.
                    Krüdener was imprudent enough to show the letter to his wife, who now for the
                    first time became certain of the nature of Stakjev's feeling for her, a feeling
                    which she did not return, but which, with innate coquetry, she had encouraged.
                    The knowledge that it was in her power to call forth such a passion had an
                    extraordinary effect upon her. From this moment it was the one dream of her life
                    to be adored. Stakjev took his departure, but all that had been fermenting in
                    Julie's young heart now forced its way to the surface. Possessed by an ardent
                    desire to love and be loved, she had first attempted to find the ideal of her
                    dreams in her husband. When he, more the father than the lover, only tried to
                    keep her <pb n="170"/> extravagant feeling in check, she fell back upon herself, and grieved
                    at being what is now called misunderstood, but what she called »not felt.«
                    Stakjev's passion rushed past her like a breath of fire and thawed the inward
                    cold which, as it were, held her emotions ice-bound. They now demanded an
                    outlet. In Copenhagen, which, of all the places she had lived in, seemed to her
                    the most unbearable–it is to be remembered that this was a hundred years
                    ago–she threw herself into a whirl of trivial social amusements, which
                    engrossed her time and mind, and brought in their train much indiscriminate and
                    reckless coquetry. Shattered nerves and an affection of the lungs were the
                    result of all the balls and theatricals, and she was ordered to spend the winter
                    of 1789 in the South.</p>

                <p>Instead of making her way to some quiet sunny spot on the shores of the
                    Mediterranean, the lady whose health had completely broken down under the strain
                    of town life hastened to Paris and there revived. In this intellectual city she
                    is suddenly struck by her own ignorance, acquires a taste for reading, or rather
                    for writers, and procures introductions to the great authors of the
                    day–Barthélémy, the author of <emph>Le jeune Anarcharse</emph>, at whose reception into
                    the Academy she was present, and Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, for whose <emph>Paul et
                    Virginie</emph> she had always had the greatest admiration. She makes a cult of
                    Saint-Pierre and nature, witnesses the fall of the Bastille, but at the same
                    time runs up an account of some 20,000 francs at her milliner's. When she is in
                    the south of France, a young officer, M. de Frègeville, falls in love with her.
                    Less inexperienced now than she had been in Copenhagen, she yields, after a
                    struggle, to his persuasions. He induces her to spend another winter in France,
                    in spite of a promise given to her husband, and to return to Paris instead of to
                    Copenhagen in the following year (1791).</p>

                <p>After Louis XVI's unsuccessful attempt at flight, Paris was no longer a safe
                    place of residence for Madame de Krüdener. She made her escape from France with
                    M. de Frègeville, who was disguised as her lackey, spent some weeks at Brussels,
                    and then travelled by way of Cassel and <pb n="171"/> Hanover to Hamburg, still accompanied
                    and protected by her lover in his character of lackey. At Hamburg she was met by
                    her husband, but as she even there refused to part from her favourite servant,
                    there was a violent scene. Krüdener advised her to go for a time to her mother
                    at Riga, and thither too she was accompanied by the disguised French officer.
                    Her mother received her most cordially. In 1792, when she and her mother went to
                    St. Petersburg to see her dying father, she again met her husband, who had come
                    there to raise the money he required to procure a divorce. She threw herself at
                    his feet, was forgiven, and made promises which she did not keep. For the next
                    few years she wandered about Europe, separated from her husband and from De
                    Frègeville, but living the life of the dissolute, gay lady of the last decade of
                    the eighteenth century. Even in his most private letters of this year her
                    husband never mentions her name.</p>

                <p>After meeting her old adorer, Stakjev, at St. Petersburg, Madame de Krüdener went
                    to Riga, where she remained for some time, then to Berlin, and thence to
                    Leipzig, where she spent great part of 1793. From Leipzig she returned to Riga,
                    but almost at once finding that town unbearable, retired to the family property
                    of Kosse. Here she formed great plans; it was her intention to become the
                    benefactress of her serfs, »to educate the Esthonian people and make them
                    happy.« In 1795 she stayed for a few months at Riga, and then went to Berlin. In
                    1796 she lived first at Lausanne, then at Geneva with her friend, Abbé Becker.
                    She frequented the society of the French <emph>émigrés</emph>, was perfectly idolised, and
                    went from fête to fête dancing the shawl-dance, which for a time was the great
                    passion of her now mature womanhood. When young girls began to dance the
                    shawl-dance too, she went off with her friend, the <emph>émigré</emph> De Vallin, to
                    Munich. After De Vallin's compulsory return to France, and Becker's death,
                    Madame de Krüdener suddenly began to long for her husband and her step-child,
                    but all that came of this was a flying visit to <pb n="172"/> Munich, where she had the
                    pleasure of making the acquaintance of this step-child, now a grown woman. After
                    a stay at Teplitz, she returned to Munich, but was presently at Teplitz again,
                    and thence went to Berlin, where, in 1800, M. de Krüdener took up his residence
                    as Russian ambassador. During these years of wandering she had probably changed
                    her lovers even more frequently than her place of residence.</p>

                <p>The winter of 1800-1801 she spent in Berlin as Russian ambassadress; but her
                    unpunctuality and general eccentricity made her anything but a favourite at the
                    well-ordered court of William III. Social success being her one desire, she
                    tried, now that she was no longer young, to attract attention by the audacity of
                    her toilettes. She had never been a beauty, but her expressive features and her
                    gracefulness had always been much admired. The simplicity which had made her so
                    irresistible ten years earlier, had now given place to a desire to create a
                    sensation by a daring style of dress, or rather undress. She covered her still
                    beautiful hair with a wig, according to the fashion of the day. Her features and
                    complexion had lost the freshness of youth.</p>

                <p>It was at this time that her restless heart, which still craved for strong
                    emotions, began to open itself to the influence of religious fanaticism. In a
                    letter to her most intimate friend she writes: »Shall I confess something to
                    you? It is in all humility of heart I write it. You know that I am not
                    arrogant–how can a Christian be? But I believe that God has deigned to bless my
                    husband ever since my return. There is no imaginable benefit or favour that is
                    not bestowed on him. Why should I not believe that the prayer of a pious heart
                    which simply and trustingly beseeches God to help it to contribute to another's
                    happiness is certain to be answered?«</p>

                <p>Why not, indeed? We should willingly believe that it was the presence of Madame
                    de Krüdener which induced Providence to shower orders and distinctions upon the
                    Baron if we did not happen to know for a fact that it was another, less romantic
                    reason which led the Emperor Paul thus to favour him. The facts of the case are
                    as follows: In the middle of an entertainment which the Baron was giving in
                    Berlin to the Prussian royal family and the Grand Duchess Helena, a despatch
                    arrived from the autocrat of all <pb n="173"/> the Russias, commanding Krüdener instantly to
                    declare war with Prussia. Their Majesties were still in the house. Instead of
                    breaking up the fête by displaying this Gorgon's head to his guests, the Russian
                    ambassador calmly let them dance on; and knowing, like the sagacious politician
                    he was, how imprudent and how fatal for Russia such a war would be, he wrote a
                    dissuasive letter to his Emperor, though well aware that, in all human
                    probability, life-long exile in Siberia would be his reward. Naturally he
                    mentioned nothing of all this to his wife. The improbable happened. Paul allowed
                    himself to be dissuaded, and, full of admiration for his minister's courage and
                    wisdom, overwhelmed him with proofs of his favour.–So we see there is a
                    different explanation from Madame de Krüdener's.</p>

                <p>From this time onwards her letters become ever more pious and edifying. She now
                    writes of religion as her panacea against melancholy, and tells of the thousand
                    sources of happiness which it offers.</p>

                <p>In the midst of all this comes a new love affair and another separation from her
                    husband. In the summer of 1801 we find her at Teplitz. Then she pays a long
                    visit to Madame de Staël at Coppet, where the desire to make a sensation as an
                    authoress is aroused in her, and she dashes off three short stories and the
                    beginning of a novel. To make this last as perfect as possible, she goes to
                    Paris to seek advice from Bernardin de Saint-Pierre and make Chateaubriand's
                    acquaintance. Chateaubriand gives her a copy of his <emph>Génie du Christianisme</emph>
                    before he has even distributed his presentation copies, and she is not a little
                    proud when Madame de Staël finds this book upon her table. But she makes such
                    indiscreet, unscrupulous use of Chateaubriand's confidences that he is estranged
                    from her for years, a complete breach being only with difficulty avoided.</p>

                <p>She is surprised in Paris by the news of Krüdener's death. She shuts herself up,
                    full of grief and remorse. It had been »her dream to return to him once more,
                    ease the burden of years for him, and requite his unending generosity.« It was
                    not long, however, before Madame de Krüdener issued from her retirement. In her
                    first short stories she had <pb n="174"/> imitated Saint-Pierre's style. Now her novel was
                    ready. She called it <emph>Valérie</emph>; her own youthful love affair with Alexander
                    Stakjev had furnished her with the plot. It is a well-written, sympathetic
                    story, perceptibly influenced by <emph>Werther</emph>. But Madame de Krüdener was not
                    satisfied with writing a novel; she wished her novel to be read and talked of.
                    The manner in which she set herself to ensure that it should be, shows that at
                    this period she had not, in spite of her attempts to do so, altogether renounced
                    the world. She was not contented with the usual stratagems, such as getting one
                    critic after another to look through the story in manuscript, reading the whole
                    or parts to select companies of friends, &amp;c, &amp;c,; no–she prepared its
                    success in a more determined and thorough manner. Her first step was to write as
                    follows to a friend in Paris, Dr. Gay, an unknown and vain member of the medical
                    profession, in whose career she had promised to interest herself:–</p>

                <p>» ... I have another favour to ask of you. Will you get some clever verse-writer
                    to address a little poem to our friend Sidonie (Sidonie is the heroine in Madame
                    de Krüdener's first short story). I need hardly ask you to be sure to see that
                    this poem is in as good taste as possible. The heading is simply to be <emph>À
                    Sidonie</emph>. Sidonie is to be asked: 'Why do you live in the country, depriving us
                    by this retired life of your charm and your wit? Does the sensation you have
                    created not call you to Paris? Only there will your charms and your talents be
                    admired as they deserve. Your fascinating dancing has been described, but who is
                    capable of describing all your attractions?' My friend, it is to your friendship
                    I confide all this; I feel quite ashamed on Sidonie's behalf, for I know her
                    modesty. You, too, know that she is not vain. I have more serious reasons than
                    the gratification of petty vanity for asking you to have these verses written,
                    and for my other actions. Be sure to say that she lives in great retirement, and
                    that only in Paris is it possible to meet with appreciation. Take care to
                    conceal that you have anything to do with this matter. Have the verses printed
                    in the evening newspaper. It is quite true that Sidonie's dancing <pb n="175"/> is described
                    in <emph>Delphine</emph>. Read the book; it will interest you. But remember, it is not to
                    be mentioned in the verses that it is in <emph>Delphine</emph> she is described. It is only
                    the heading, <emph>À Sidonie</emph>, that is to give any clue to the person to whom they
                    are addressed. Be so kind as to pay the newspaper. I hope to be able to explain
                    my reasons to you. Send me the number containing the verses as soon as it comes
                    out. If the paper will not accept the verses, or if there is to be too long a
                    delay in their appearance, send me the manuscript and I shall have them inserted
                    in a newspaper here. You will be doing a great favour to your friend, and she
                    will explain to you by word of mouth why she has asked it. You know her
                    timidity, her love of solitude, and her dislike of praise; but it is an
                    important service you are doing her.«</p>

                <p>A fortnight later we have another letter on the same subject, another request to
                    know if Dr. Gay has read <emph>Delphine</emph>: »Madame de Staël told Sidonie that she
                    would describe her dancing, and you will find the description in the first
                    volume. Many people think that she has described Sidonie's face, way of
                    speaking, and lively imagination, and mixed up with this her own religious and
                    political opinions; for Sidonie is <emph>profoundly religious</emph>, and takes very little
                    interest in politics.« On this follow more directions with regard to the poem:
                    »It must tell that her beautiful dancing has been described, without intimating
                    by whom–must simply say: 'An able pen has depicted your dancing; the success
                    you have met with everywhere is well known; your charms have been sung as well
                    as your wit, and yet you persistently conceal them from the world. A solitary
                    life in your home is your choice. There you seek happiness in religion, in
                    nature, in study, &amp;c, &amp;c, &amp;c.' This, dear friend, is what I want; I
                    shall give you my reasons by-and-by.«</p>

                <p>The address to Sidonie arrives; Madame de Krüdener acknowledges its reception:
                    »It is only fair, dear friend, that you should have a copy of the charming elegy
                    you have written for me, so I herewith send you one; I wish to keep yours
                    myself.«</p>

                <p><pb n="176"/> The elegy runs: »What is it you seek in your solitude? Paris, bewitched by the
                    magic emanating from you, by your grace, by the brilliant talents with which
                    Heaven has gifted you, surely offers you hearts enough, hearts which your gentle
                    spirit has enchained. We saw you, we flocked round you on that day when you
                    exercised the seductive power of grace and the constraining power of beauty, the
                    day when, assured of the palm of genius, you did not despise the praises offered
                    to talent. You even smiled upon a certain ingenious versifier who ventured to
                    blend his weak voice with the chorus of the sages and to sketch your magic dance
                    in words. But the memory of those festive days has been effaced by the
                    thunderbolt which has fallen from heaven upon you! Do not our hearts share in
                    your melancholy reflections? Have they not, devoutly silent, sighed with you in
                    your sorrow? We would not offend you with impotent consolation, that paraded
                    offering to a paraded sorrow–we heard you sigh, and we sighed with you. We
                    sighed with you, and you flee from us! Why do you flee? We are decked in
                    mourning weeds; the arts keep silence; love hides itself, and with it hide all
                    its attendant gaieties, that of yore were your joy and your glory.«</p>

                <p>There is as much again, but this is enough. Madame de Krüdener's letter ends: »I
                    send you this elegy, the antique colouring (!) and beauty of which I admire. I
                    appropriate nothing in it except the sorrow, which you have correctly observed
                    in me and have desired to alleviate. I have much more than this to say to you,
                    dear Dr. Gay, much that is more flattering for you, but I cannot find room for
                    it here, can only with a grateful heart offer my thanks to your art, your noble
                    art, so beneficial to humanity (!).«</p>

                <p>Dr. Gay then proceeded to rhyme his prose. Madame de Krüdener writes to him:
                    »Sidonie has requested me to convey her heartfelt thanks to the kindest of
                    friends. The verses are charming. They are already in print. What an enviably
                    gifted man he is who wrote them! How easy it is to see that he is Sidonie's
                    friend! How well he paints what he desires us to see! In every stroke one feels
                    that it is the soul which has wielded the brush–and what a noble soul!<pb n="177"/>...
                    Sidonie has also received an elegy in prose, which you must see, and which she
                    considers exceedingly beautiful. What talent is displayed in the noble, simple
                    style, and how one is drawn to the mind which speaks such a language! A few
                    alterations have been made, very few; you have been most successful in doing
                    what was desired!«</p>

                <p>We observe that Sidonie was not content with writing out a rough draft of her own
                    encomiums, but that she also corrected the fair copy. Such proceedings require
                    no comment. The indefatigable doctor composes more poems, and receives requests
                    to plague this, that, and the other critic. No importuning was required in the
                    case of the pious historian, Michaud, who spent thirty years of his life in
                    writing the history of the Crusades; it was rendered superfluous by the intimacy
                    of his relations with the authoress; his criticism was an enthusiastic one. At
                    last Madame de Krüdener is able to write to a friend: »My health is much
                    improved; I have been at balls eight nights running without being the worse for
                    it. What happiness! I cannot tell you, my friend, how much I am made of; poems
                    are showered on me, I am overwhelmed with attentions, people dispute the
                    privilege of a word with me. It is a thousand times more than I deserve; but
                    <emph>Providence loves to overwhelm its children with benefits</emph>, even when they do
                    not deserve them.... I should look upon it as cowardice not to publish a work
                    which in my opinion is a useful one; therefore I regard the journey to Paris in
                    the light of <emph>a duty</emph>; for my heart, my imagination, everything, draws me to the
                    Lake of Geneva.«</p>

                <p>She went to Paris, and <emph>Valérie</emph> was published in December 1803. All Madame de
                    Krüdener's guns were primed, ready to salute the book. Not one missed fire. All
                    the bells of criticism tolled. Like a good general, she was on the field of
                    battle herself. She drove incognito from one fashionable shop to another, asking
                    for hats, or scarfs, or feathers, or wreaths, or ribbons <emph>à la Valérie</emph>. When
                    this elegant and still beautiful lady drove up in her carriage and asked with
                    such assurance for these articles of her own invention, the shopkeepers did
                    their utmost to come to an understanding of what she wanted and to provide it.
                    And when astonished <pb n="178"/> shop-girls denied the existence of such wares, Madame de
                    Krüdener smiled so kindly and pitied them so much because they did not know
                    <emph>Valérie</emph> that she quickly transformed them into eager canvassers of readers for
                    her book. She drove on with her purchases to other shops, and in a few days had
                    produced amongst the shopkeepers such a furious competition in articles <emph>à la
                    Valérie</emph> that her friends, when they went at her instigation to ask for these
                    wares, became innocent accomplices in her stratagem, and were constrained to
                    bear witness to her triumph.</p>

                <p>Now Madame de Krüdener writes to her friend: »The success of <emph>Valérie</emph> is
                    complete and unprecedented. An acquaintance said to me the other day: 'There is
                    something <emph>supernatural</emph> about such success.' Yes, my friend, it is the will of
                    Heaven that this purer morality should be diffused throughout France, where as
                    yet it is not so well understood.«</p>

                <p>Hardly had this feverish craving for celebrity been satisfied, this refinement of
                    hypocrisy been brought to perfection, when Madame de Krüdener's genuine
                    conversion took place. It came about in this wise. Sitting at the window of her
                    house in Riga one day in 1805, she was in the act of bowing to one of the most
                    favoured of her numerous admirers when the unfortunate man was seized with a fit
                    of apoplexy and fell down dead. This incident preyed on her mind. Her
                    melancholy, however, did not render her independent of earthly requirements, and
                    she sent one day for a shoemaker to measure her for a pair of shoes. The man
                    came. At first she hardly noticed him, but while he was kneeling in front of her
                    she was struck by his happy expression. »Are you happy?« she asked him. »I am
                    the happiest man in the world,« was the reply. This shoemaker was one of the
                    »awakened,« a member of the community of Moravian Brethren. He had an aversion
                    to work, and lived at home with his mother, Frau Blau, one of the worst
                    religious hypocrites in Riga, who gained her livelihood by imposing upon the
                    rich members of her sect. The sight of the shoemaker's happiness made such an
                    impression on Madame de Krüdener's susceptible soul that she again and again <pb n="179"/> visited his mother and him. At their house she made acquaintance with many more
                    of the Moravian Brethren, and was soon as enthusiastic a Christian believer as
                    any one of them. A gradual, slow training in Christianity would not have been
                    possible in her case, but the doctrine of sudden conversion and entire change of
                    life was one well calculated to have a strong effect upon her, now that she was
                    over forty.</p>

                <p>The same ardour which she had exhibited in the passions of her youth she now
                    expended on the passion of her maturer years. Both her words and actions are
                    henceforth inspired by religious enthusiasm. She divides her time between
                    devotional exercises and charitable deeds. Her whole previous life seems to her
                    to have been nothing but error and foolishness. Her whole life now is but one
                    feeling, love to her Saviour. »I have not a thought except to please, to serve,
                    to sacrifice everything to Him through whose grace I desire nothing except to be
                    allowed to love all my fellow-men, and who shows me nothing in the future but
                    glimpses of bliss. Oh, if men but knew the happiness of religion, how they would
                    shun every care except care for their souls!«</p>

                <p>Such was Madame de Krüdener's state of mind when, travelling once more in the
                    autumn of 1806, she met and became intimate with Queen Louisa of Prussia. It was
                    not long after the battle of Jena. The Queen, in her deep dejection, was
                    peculiarly open to the persuasion of Madame de Krüdener's glowing religious
                    eloquence, and Madame de Krüdener gained great influence over her, and through
                    her over the King. We have proof of this in a letter from the Queen written some
                    time afterwards. »I owe to your kind heart a confession which I am certain will
                    cause you to shed tears of joy. It is that you have made me better than I was.
                    Your straightforward words when we talked together on the subject of religion
                    and Christianity have made the deepest impression upon me.«</p>

                <p>Madame de Krüdener went to Karlsruhe on purpose to see Jung-Stilling.
                    Jung-Stilling had made a literary reputation for himself by the book in which he
                    gave an account of his early life as a pious journeyman tailor. As a medical <pb n="180"/> student at Strasburg he had associated with Goethe and won his favour. After
                    practising successfully as an oculist, and holding a professorship of political
                    economy, he had become a kind of prophet among the Pietists of South Germany,
                    and was honoured as a saint by the pious court-circle and nobility of Baden. His
                    character was not strong enough to stand such adulation, and he had degenerated
                    into a vain and unreliable old twaddler, who boasted of his knowledge of the
                    other world and revealed the hidden mysteries and designs of God by means of
                    interpretations of the Revelation of St. John. To Jung-Stilling Madame de
                    Krüdener now did homage as her master and guide. He had a weakness for the
                    admiration of great ladies, and a close friendship sprang up between them. The
                    venerable ghost-seer was at this time writing his <emph>Theorie der Geisterkunde</emph>
                    (Theory of Spirits). Madame de Krüdener was firmly persuaded of the truth of one
                    of his wise predictions, namely, that the millennium was to begin in the year
                    1816, or 1819 at latest.</p>

                <p>Not long after this visit to Karlsruhe she met Queen Hortense, who was so
                    fascinated by her that she gave her a private audience every morning. But it
                    would seem that Madame de Krüdener ingratiated herself in this case chiefly by
                    reading to the Queen the manuscript of a novel she was writing, <emph>Othilde</emph> by
                    name, the pious moral of which did not prevent its being a »truly delicious«
                    love-story.</p>

                <p>She was now a pattern of every kind of Christian humility. When at Karlsruhe she
                    climbed up to the dirtiest garrets to do deeds of charity. One day when she
                    found a servant-girl crying in the street because she had been sent out to
                    sweep, the great lady took the broom and swept the pavement herself.</p>

                <p>The spiritual condition of Alsace at this time was somewhat remarkable. To some
                    of its most intellectually advanced inhabitants the irreligion of the Revolution
                    had communicated itself, but the great mass of the Protestant population had
                    been terrified into a kind of religious mysticism, the distinctive feature of
                    which was the belief in the near approach of the millennium. The most eminent <pb n="181"/> clergyman in Alsace was the universally respected Pastor Oberlin of Waldbach, a
                    man of the most sincere piety, who was, however, crazy enough to draw maps of
                    the kingdom of heaven and publish a plan of the heavenly Jerusalem. He knew the
                    exact order of precedence of the blessed dead, and was in regular communication
                    with departed friends. Madame de Krüdener, provided with letters of introduction
                    to this gentleman and others of the same persuasion, made her appearance in
                    Alsace.</p>

                <p>She had heard that a German pastor at Markirch, named Fontaines, had the power of
                    working miracles, and that in his house lived a famous prophetess, Marie Kummer
                    (generally known as »die Kummerin«), a hysterical Würtemberg peasant woman, who
                    held constant communication with angels, and in her trances revealed the will of
                    God. And she had also been told that Fontaines had expressed a wish to make the
                    acquaintance of the divinely inspired lady from the North whom Marie Kummer had
                    seen in a vision. In June 1808 Madame de Krüdener arrived at his house. He
                    welcomed her solemnly on the threshold with the words of John to Jesus: »Art
                    thou that one that should come, or do we look for another?« Flattered and
                    delighted, Madame de Krüdener remained under the roof of this man, who was now
                    generally supposed to be her lover. They spent their time in the study of the
                    Revelation of St. John, and every day the lady listened to Marie Kummer's
                    prophecies of the high mission and the great future awaiting her, and also
                    Fontaines, who was to be her apostle. She wrote to a friend: »I am the happiest
                    creature in the world.... The fulness of time is at hand; great calamities are
                    about to happen, but you need not be afraid. The kingdom of the Lord is near,
                    and He Himself will reign upon the earth for a thousand years.« She goes on to
                    say: »Imagine that I have literally <emph>experienced miracles</emph>. You have no
                    conception of the happiness felt by those who give themselves entirely to Jesus
                    Christ. He in His goodness and mercy has given me the distinct promise that He
                    will answer the prayers I offer for my relations and friends.«</p>

                <p><pb n="182"/> It is not to be denied that the language in which she describes this new ardent
                    devotion has a suspicious similarity to the language of a love which is not at
                    all heavenly. Of God she writes: »It is impossible for me to tell what
                    tenderness burns in my heart, how many tears I shed, what words tremble through
                    my whole being when I feel myself loved thus–I, poor worm of the earth! I said
                    to God the other day: 'What can I say to Thee, O my Beloved! (<emph>O mon
                    bien-aimé!</emph>) Would that I could shout over the whole earth, and through all the
                    heavens, how much I love Thee! Would that I could lead not only all men, but all
                    the rebel spirits back to Thee!«</p>

                <p>In the Vatican hangs a picture by a modern Italian painter which represents a nun
                    kneeling at the feet of Christ, who returns her tearful gaze with the tenderest
                    of glances. One involuntarily thinks of this picture when reading Madame de
                    Krüdener's outbursts during her period of divine intoxication. She writes on
                    another occasion: »All we have to do is to love, and to persuade others to love,
                    the kindest, the best, the tenderest of all fathers.« During her pious
                    wanderings about the country, preaching and converting, she was joined by a
                    young missionary. He was one of the many in whom she was afterwards
                    disappointed, but shortly after he came to her she describes their feelings when
                    worshipping together in such words as these: »What emotion! Can you imagine the
                    bliss of our communions? No language can express it. We could not even hear the
                    words spoken.« It is impossible in reading this not to think of a passage in the
                    writings of one of Madame de Krüdener's early admirers: »Lezay prétend (dit
                    Chênedollé) que Madame de Krüdener dans les moments les plus décisifs avec son
                    amant fait une prière à Dieu, en disant: Mon Dieu, que je suis heureuse! Je vous
                    demande pardon de l'excès de mon bonheur?« He adds: »Elle reçoit ce sacrifice
                    comme une personne qui va recevoir sa communion.«<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">A manuscript of Chênedollé's, quoted by Sainte-Beuve in <emph>Derniers Portraits</emph>,
                        p. 290.</note> Similar pious emotionalism
                    is, however, common to all the mystics of the day.</p>

                <p>Madame de Krüdener did not know that both Fontaines <pb n="183"/> and Marie Kummer had a past
                    which was anything but confidence-inspiring.</p>

                <p>At the outbreak of the Revolution Fontaines, then aged twenty, was a violent
                    Jacobin; during the Reign of Terror he cast in his lot with Eulogius Schneider,
                    and was one of the most eager of that man's followers in denouncing the clergy,
                    closing churches, plundering Strasburg Cathedral, &amp;c. He held orations in
                    the temples of Reason, got himself appointed a Protestant pastor, married, and
                    behaved in such a scandalous manner that he was compelled to give up his charge.
                    Nevertheless, when the reaction against the Revolution set in, he received
                    another call, as representative of the extremest Pietism, and soon gained a
                    great reputation as an exorciser of evil spirits. When it came out that he had
                    managed in three years (1801-4) to make away with almost all the means of his
                    congregation, he had to retire into obscurity for a time. In 1805 he received a
                    call to Markirch. There, two years later, he took Marie Kummer into his house.
                    This woman, though she was a simple vagrant, and had changed her religion
                    several times, was held in great reverence by the Pietists. A certain Pastor
                    Hiller consecrated her to be the bride of Jesus. In the course of time she bore
                    this same pastor a son, who was destined, they declared, to become the witness
                    mentioned in the third verse of the eleventh chapter of the Book of Revelation.
                    The worldly-minded civil authorities none the less condemned Marie to the
                    pillory and a term of imprisonment. When she came out of prison she proclaimed
                    the end of the world to be at hand, and advised a general emigration of
                    believers to the Holy Land. She actually persuaded a number of foolish persons
                    to set out with her for Jerusalem, and to entrust her with the travelling funds;
                    but when they reached Vienna she was taken into custody. After a term of
                    imprisonment there she went back to Alsace. The comet of 1807 furnished her with
                    a pretext for sensational prophecies of plague, famine, and war, and on hearing
                    the report of the arrival of the Russian baroness she had a vision, in which
                    that lady's high destiny was revealed to her.</p>

                <p><pb n="184"/> When Madame de Krüdener had lived in the edifying company of Fontaines and Marie
                    Kummer for fully eight months, Fontaines began to feel that he was no longer
                    safe in Markirch. Tales of his past life were being circulated. Marie Kummer
                    consequently had a vision in which she received a divine command to go to
                    Würtemberg and found a colony of true Christians there. The three at once set
                    out. At their religious meetings in Würtemberg Fontaines was always dressed in
                    black, Madame de Krüdener in blue, and Marie in grey. Besides prophesying the
                    approaching end of the world they incautiously inveighed against the ungodly
                    sovereign of the country, who had introduced a new liturgy. This led to Marie's
                    imprisonment and the banishment of the other two. Marie joined Fontaines and
                    Madame de Krüdener in Baden as soon as she was released, and there they again
                    lived in intimate companionship, occupying themselves as before with devotional
                    exercises and prophesying.</p>

                <p>Madame de Krüdener, called to Riga by her mother's last illness, held meetings
                    there too, at which she interpreted the Book of Revelation and dispensed the
                    sacrament. At these meetings she was assisted by the pious shoemaker's pious
                    mother, Frau Blau, in her character of prophetess. Towards the close of the year
                    1811 Madame de Krüdener returned to Karlsruhe. Fontaines had by this time been
                    ordered off, but she continued to work in company with Marie Kummer, who was
                    looked up to as a great prophetess because she had foretold the victory of the
                    white over the black angel, and had announced that the people from the north of
                    whom Jeremiah had written would presently make their appearance. The Russian war
                    established her reputation, and after the news of the conflagration of Moscow
                    came she was regarded as a positively sacred personage.</p>

                <p>There is not the slightest doubt that Madame de Krüdener was entirely persuaded
                    of the purity of her motives, and that she acted in all sincerity. She is not
                    merely converted herself; she is possessed by a passion for converting. Again
                    and again the idea of converting the very denizens of hell and the devil himself
                    occurs to her. It was but natural that she had to bear much and painful
                    misunder<pb n="185"/>standing on the part of those who were unable to believe in the change
                    that had taken place in her. Even her own mother despised her and stopped
                    writing to her. But no misunderstanding cooled her enthusiasm, which made an
                    impression even upon rationalists. One of these, Sonntag, the chief dignitary of
                    the Livonian church, who had carefully observed her behaviour at Riga in 1811,
                    wrote many years afterwards that, though in his official capacity he had been
                    obliged to sever his connection with her, he owed it to her to bear witness that
                    she showed the deepest, purest, most active, most self-forgetful and
                    self-sacrificing sympathy with every suffering and need of humanity.</p>

                <p>Soon she, too, receives the gift of prophecy. It was not an uncommon gift at this
                    time. Both De Maistre and Bonald prophesied the restoration of the royal family
                    many years in advance, thereby winning considerable renown. But whenever their
                    prophecies are of a more definite nature, it happens with them as with the
                    prophecies of old–they do not come to pass. De Maistre, for instance, writing
                    on the subject of the proposed seat of government in America, says: »I may
                    safely wager ten to one that the town will not be built, or that it will not be
                    called Washington, or that the Congress will not meet there;« which three things
                    all happened. In 1807 he wrote (<emph>Opuscules</emph>, p. 98): »Nothing can restore the
                    power of Prussia. This famous edifice, built of blood, filth, false coin, and
                    pamphlets, has collapsed in one moment and is gone for ever.« He also prophesied
                    that the restoration of the Bourbons would take place quite peacefully, without
                    foreign interference, and that autocratic rule and the power of the aristocracy
                    would in the end be strengthened by the Revolution, &amp;c., &amp;c. Some of
                    Bonald's prophecies (in his <emph>Théorie du Pouvoir</emph>) were rather more successful,
                    for the simple reason that he who prophesies the end of the transient,
                    prophesies what is certain to come true some day; there are things concerning
                    the future to which Horatio's words apply: »There needs no ghost come from the
                    grave to tell us this.«</p>

                <p>But Madame de Krüdener's prophecies attracted more attention than those of any of
                    her contemporaries. In <pb n="186"/> October 1814 she wrote from Strasburg to a lady at the
                    Russian court: »We shall soon witness the punishment of guilty France, a
                    punishment which Providence would have spared it if it had continued to bow
                    beneath the cross.« How was it possible, after Napoleon's return from Elba, to
                    interpret this otherwise than as a mysterious prevision of this return?</p>

                <p>She also wrote: »The storm is approaching; the lilies which the Eternal had
                    preserved–the pure, delicate, symbolic flowers which had been crushed by a
                    sceptre of iron, because such was the will of the Eternal–those lilies, which
                    ought to have pled their cause before the tribunal of the purity and love of
                    God, have only shown themselves to disappear.« What could this be but a prophecy
                    of the flight of Louis XVIII?</p>

                <p>The fame of these predictions sped over Europe. One of the first to hear of them
                    was Czar Alexander. Worn out by the campaigns of 1813 and 1814, tormented by an
                    uneasy conscience, grieved by the sudden death of his only child and by the
                    desertion of its mother, a lady who had been his mistress for eleven years, but
                    whose affections were now transferred to one of his aides-de-camp, enfeebled by
                    excesses of every kind, Alexander was exactly in the condition to be influenced
                    by pious mysticism.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Chateaubriand, <emph>Congrès de Vérone</emph>, i. 147.</note></p>

                <p>He had been brought up without any religious education whatever. When, during his
                    depression after the capture of Moscow, Prince Galitzin recommended him to seek
                    comfort in the study of the Bible, such a thing as a Russian Bible was not to be
                    found in the Winter Palace, and he had to be contented for the time with a
                    French translation of the Vulgate. The proceedings at the Congress of Vienna,
                    the faithlessness of Austria, the ingratitude of France, and the animosity
                    aroused by his favourite project, the rehabilitation of Poland, in that country
                    itself, had completely shaken his faith in human nature. The surprise of
                    Napoleon's return from Elba had shaken his nerves. From the moment of his
                    mistress's desertion he came under the influence of his wife, the Empress
                    Elizabeth, who in her deserted condition <pb n="187"/> had long ago taken refuge in melancholy
                    mysticism. She persuaded him when he was at Karlsruhe to visit Jung-Stilling and
                    learn what was his opinion of the political situation, viewed from the
                    standpoint of the Book of Revelation. Jung-Stilling assured him that Napoleon
                    was none other than the Apollyon mentioned in the ninth chapter of that book,
                    and that the millennium was at hand.</p>

                <p>In 1814, at the court of Baden, Madame de Krüdener had made the acquaintance of
                    the Czarina, and since then the ardent prophetess had carried on a
                    correspondence with one of Elizabeth's maids of honour who had an enthusiastic
                    admiration for the Czar, with the full intention that her letters should be
                    shown to him. Certain sentences in them were unmistakably written for his
                    reading, such as the following: »What you tell me of the Czar's great and noble
                    qualities I have long known. I know, too, that the Lord will grant me the
                    happiness of seeing him–that the Prince of Darkness will in vain endeavour to
                    prevent our meeting. I have much to say to the Czar.« Immediately after the
                    despatch of the letter here quoted from, Madame de Krüdener moved to Heilbronn;
                    the Russian headquarters were presently transferred there, and late in the
                    evening of the 4th of June 1815, heedless of the aide-de-camp's rebuffs, she
                    made her way, unannounced, into the Czar's presence, and remained closeted with
                    him for three hours. When she left him, Alexander's eyes were full of tears, and
                    he was much agitated. Soon her influence over him was complete. They would shut
                    themselves up together for half a day at a time, praying, reading the Bible, and
                    discussing theological problems.</p>

                <p>The days immediately preceding the battle of Waterloo they spend at Heidelberg,
                    occupied in studying the Psalms. The intelligence of the reverses at Ligny and
                    Quatre-Bras on the 16th and 17th of June reaches Alexander when he is thus
                    employed; the Psalms console him and convince him of the justice of his cause.
                    He prays and fasts. On the 18th of June the battle of Waterloo is fought.
                    Alexander immediately sets out for Paris, but with the understanding that Madame
                    de Krüdener is to follow promptly. His <pb n="188"/> greatest grief at this moment is that his
                    brother Constantine is not converted too. Before leaving Heidelberg our
                    prophetess visits the prisoners who are awaiting their sentence of death and
                    preaches to them with great effect; then she follows the Czar, whose Christian
                    disposition affords her intense satisfaction.</p>

                <p>In Paris her influence reaches its culminating point. The Czar calls upon her on
                    the evening of her arrival. Her apartments in the Hôtel Montchenu are so
                    situated that he can come to her at any hour of the day from the Elysée-Bourbon
                    Palace by a private garden door. No dissipation, no amusement had now any
                    temptation for the man whom the Parisians remembered as being so gay but a few
                    years previously. »I am a disciple of Christ,« he said; »I go about with the
                    Gospel in my hands, and know nothing else.« And Madame de Krüdener writes of
                    him: »Alexander is the elect of God. He is treading the path of renunciation.«
                    Only language borrowed from the Apocalypse could express what she saw in him–a
                    founder of the kingdom of Christ upon earth, an angel of peace with the flaming
                    sword of power, the prince of light, &amp;c, &amp;c. Napoleon, on the other
                    hand, she, like Adam Müller and his followers, believed to be the devil himself.
                    Alexander was to restore the power of Christianity upon earth, and to obliterate
                    the last trace of the Revolution and its deeds.</p>

                <p>Alexander's reverence and gratitude knew no bounds. In the beginning of September
                    a great review of 150,000 Russian troops was held at the Camp des Vertus in
                    Champagne. Madame de Krüdener's presence could not be dispensed with. The Czar's
                    carriage was sent for her early in the morning, and he received her, not like a
                    favourite subject, but like a messenger from heaven, sent to lead his troops to
                    victory. »Bare-headed, or wearing the little straw-hat which she generally
                    carried hanging from her arm; her still fair hair hanging in plaits upon her
                    shoulders, with a stray curl falling on her brow; dressed in a plain, dark robe,
                    to which its cut and her bearing imparted elegance, and which was confined at
                    the waist by a simple <pb n="189"/> girdle–thus she arrived at dawn of day, thus she stood at
                    the moment of prayer in front of the astonished army.«<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Sainte-Beuve, from the account of an eye-witness.</note></p>

                <p>About a year before this Alexander had read a book by the German mystic Franz von
                    Baader, <emph>On the Necessity Produced by the Revolution for a New and More Intimate
                    Connection between Religion and Politics</emph>. Under its influence he had formed a
                    vague project for uniting the Christian monarchs of Europe in a mysterious
                    alliance, which was to be in a very special manner commended to the protection
                    of God; but at Vienna he had been obliged to give up all thoughts of carrying
                    this project into effect. Now he discussed it with Madame de Krüdener. She
                    entered into it eagerly, declaring that she herself had already, by the grace of
                    God, conceived the very same idea. And who dare say that it is impossible or
                    even unlikely that such an idea as this, <emph>the plan of the Holy Alliance</emph>, should
                    have originated in the brain of a poor, silly woman, whose head had been turned
                    by the amours of her youth and the religious enthusiasm of her later years? It
                    is, as a matter of fact, more than probable that Europe and civilisation owe
                    their thanks to her for it. A man who is distinctly inclined to undervalue her
                    influence, and who is wrong where he denies it, Queen Louisa of Prussia's
                    beloved brother, the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, writes: »Madame de
                    Krüdener never exercised the smallest influence over my angelic sister of
                    Prussia, nor yet over the King, her husband, who judged this lamentably famous
                    woman perfectly correctly. Of the Emperor Alexander she had, on the contrary,
                    taken such complete possession that the Holy Alliance, which he proposed and
                    succeeded in forming, may be regarded as entirely her work; you may be sure that
                    I should not say this unless I were certain of it.«</p>

                <p>Some days after her arrival in Paris, Alexander said to Madame de Krüdener: »I am
                    leaving France; but before my departure I shall publish a manifesto,
                    acknowledging our gratitude to God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, for
                    His protection, and calling on all nations to unite in common submission to the
                    Gospel.« With these words he handed her a paper. It was the draft of the compact <pb n="190"/> between the three sovereigns. Capefigue, who actually saw this document, writes:
                    »I have lying before me the rough draft of the compact; it is from beginning to
                    end in the Emperor Alexander's handwriting, with corrections by Madame de
                    Krüdener. The words <emph>The Holy Alliance</emph> are written by that extraordinary
                    woman.« Thus even the name is of her devising. She chose it with a reference to
                    the prophecies of the end of the world in the Book of the Prophet Daniel.</p>

                <p>Having traced this woman's career from the very beginning, we know who and what
                    she was; we have also some idea of what the Revolution was; consequently our
                    first feeling is one of astonishment that these pious maxims and reminiscences
                    of the Apocalypse written, with the same pen which wrote the Elegy to Sidonie,
                    by the lady who a few years before was buying scarfs and hats <emph>à la Valérie</emph>,
                    should have had power to stem the renewed impetus of the current of the
                    Revolution for fifteen years. Not for fifteen years did inevitable evolution,
                    the progress of science, the audacity of art, the rebellion of hearts, take
                    shape in action which broke the charm.</p>

                <p>The three monarchs »solemnly declare, in the name of the most holy and
                    indivisible Trinity, that their intention in the present proclamation is to
                    assert in face of the universe their irrevocable determination to be guided,
                    both in the government of their own dominions and in their political relations
                    with other governments, entirely by the rules of justice, love, and truth
                    contained in the Christian religion. Far from being only applicable in private
                    life, these prescriptions ought directly to influence the conduct of rulers, as
                    indicating the only means of placing the institutions of society on a solid
                    foundation and remedying their imperfections.«</p>

                <p>So much for the words of the compact. What was really sincere and benevolent
                    intention on the part of the foolish imperial enthusiast was sagacious hypocrisy
                    on that of his brother monarchs. Who does not know the rest? Who does not know
                    what the Holy Alliance came to mean–the introduction of a general European
                    reaction, in essence barbarism, in its outward form a lie? It was in the name <pb n="191"/> of
                    the Holy Alliance that, during the saddest decades of our century, even the very
                    feeblest endeavours in the direction of intellectual and political liberty were
                    checked or crushed.</p>

                <p>The Alliance received the voluntary adhesion of the potentate who had most to
                    gain from it, the Pope. Without any petty consideration of his own position as
                    head of the Roman Catholic Church, Pius lauded to the skies the resolution of
                    his compeers–Alexander, the Greek Pope; the King of Prussia, the Lutheran Pope;
                    and the King of England, the Anglican Pope. At the Congress of Vienna he
                    proposed a plan of restoration in comparison with which the dreams of all the
                    reactionaries of other days paled and all previous attempts to restore
                    pre-Revolutionary conditions sank into nothingness. With one stroke of the pen
                    the existence of the Revolution and the Empire was blotted out. The Holy Roman
                    Empire was to be restored, and along with it all the social conditions and
                    institutions of the Middle Ages–tithes, church property, exemption of the
                    clergy from taxation, and the Inquisition.</p>

                <p>The last years of Madame de Krüdener's life present no events of historical
                    interest. She became ever more sincerely and fanatically religious, and her
                    desire to display her faith in deeds became ever more ardent. It was now the one
                    desire of her heart and object of her life to help the poor and the sick. She
                    preached to the poor, founded churches, and proclaimed the advent of the kingdom
                    of God. But from the moment when her Christianity took a practical form the
                    character of her position changed. The royal personages, the authorities, all
                    the great, who as long as she remained the court lady had smiled upon her,
                    instinctively divined an enemy in her as soon as she began to address herself to
                    the people. On one occasion she traversed Switzerland from frontier to frontier
                    in a sort of mad religious triumphal procession; the next time she visited that
                    country she was driven out of one town after the other. At Basle, where she
                    distributed tracts among the soldiers and according to her own account converted
                    half the garrison, the infuriated clergy succeeded in having her expelled <pb n="192"/> from
                    the town. In Baden, where her charities during a famine were truly munificent,
                    her house was surrounded by gendarmes, and the people who had sought refuge with
                    her were dispersed. She was expelled from Lucerne by the police authorities.
                    When she tried to make her way into France through Alsace, she was turned back,
                    and was at the same time forbidden to return to Baden. She was finally conducted
                    under police escort to the Russian frontier, being passed on by the Würtemberg
                    to the Bavarian, by the Bavarian to the Saxon, by the Saxon to the Prussian
                    police, and by these last handed over to the authorities of her own country. She
                    had lost Alexander's favour for ever, partly because she had been much too
                    communicative about the origin of the Holy Alliance, partly because of the mixed
                    and often bad company in which she travelled about. The accounts which she gave
                    in her religious periodicals and pamphlets of social evils, of the boundless
                    distress of the poor and the unjust oppressions of their rulers, were denounced
                    as socialism and communism. Christianity as she understood it could not but be
                    obnoxious to the authorities. She was, moreover, foolish enough to express her
                    enthusiastic sympathy with the Greek war of independence in a very incautious
                    manner, and presumptuous enough to declare openly that the Emperor, as founder
                    of the Holy Alliance, was in duty bound to place himself in the forefront of a
                    crusade against Turkey. Cast off by Alexander, she left St. Petersburg, and from
                    this time onwards lived, as a missionary, a life of self-inflicted penance. She
                    underwent all kinds of hardships, suffering voluntarily herself, and alleviating
                    the sufferings of others whenever it was possible. She died in 1824 while on a
                    missionary expedition in the Crimea.</p>

                <p>An interesting contrast to the French-Russian Madame de Krüdener is to be found
                    in the German-Russian Princess Galizin, a lady who belongs to the end of the
                    eighteenth, as Madame de Krüdener does to the beginning of the nineteenth
                    century. Madame de Krüdener's characteristics stand out more sharply on such a
                    background as the life of Madame de Galizin. The Princess's is a genuinely
                    German type <pb n="193"/> of character. She is as simple as her younger contemporary is
                    polished and complex; she is ingenuous and at the same time sentimental, full of
                    soul and wanting in brain-power. Her husband was, like Krüdener, a man of the
                    world. He was a friend and admirer of Diderot; it was, indeed, Diderot who first
                    inspired the Princess with the desire and the courage to study, but she soon
                    became that philosopher's ardent opponent. As careless of her feminine
                    attractions as Madame de Krüdener was coquettish, Madame de Galizin had her head
                    shaved to make it impossible for her to go into society, and from the age of
                    twenty-four lived a life of seclusion. To cure herself entirely of egoism she
                    »offered to the God of love the sacrifice of her understanding.« As an instance
                    of her ignorance of the world it may be mentioned that, when her son desired to
                    enter the military service of a foreign country, she applied first to the
                    Prussian, then to the Austrian commander-in-chief for permission to send along
                    with him a tutor who was to guard him against the irregular habits of military
                    life, and was astonished by receiving the answer from both that it was
                    impossible for an officer to join the army accompanied by a male governess of
                    this description.</p>

                <p>In spite of Princess Galizin's warm-hearted sincerity, her tone is as

                <p>In Madame de Krüdener we have before us a being whose original equipment would
                    seem to mark her as destined to act some important part. She possesses a vigour
                    of life and a vividness of emotion sufficient for two ordinary <pb n="194"/> human beings;
                    only it is not healthy vigour and emotion, but an inward restlessness, an inward
                    fire, which gives out sparks incessantly on every side. There is in her an
                    original capital of Russian volatility and pliability, German sentimentality,
                    French sense of proportion, and »Asiatic« sensual charm.</p>

                <p>She enters life with no thorough education behind her, no serious aim before her,
                    with a strong craving for happiness, and a poetic turn–predestined, therefore,
                    to live in illusions. When she finds herself surrounded by admirers she gives
                    herself up to dizzy enjoyment of this gratification, and begins to regard
                    herself as a superior being. As long as she preserves outward fidelity to her
                    husband she lives in the illusion that she is the heroine of duty. When she
                    becomes unfaithful, she chooses a new model, and is transformed in her own
                    estimation into another ideal, the ideal fair sinner. She writes of the ladies
                    of Geneva, that they have neither the charm of virtue nor »the charm of sin.«
                    This latter she herself acquired. She continued to be ideal in so far as it is
                    ideal to be the first of one's own species, unique. On this supposition of her
                    own ideality is founded her belief that it was she who brought happiness (orders
                    and titles) to her husband.</p>

                <p>All illusion consists in a wrong association of cause and effect–religious
                    illusion like the rest. But religious illusion is a double illusion; the
                    individual subject to it does not trace the effect to its cause, but to a vague
                    origin, the centre of existence–illusion number one–and in the centre of
                    existence he places, not, as he imagines, the Deity, but himself–illusion
                    number two. The beautiful wife believes that her husband receives his
                    decorations direct from God, but also that she herself is the cause of God's
                    bestowing them. She is the real cause, God is the means by which she works. She
                    continues to lead her gay life as long as it continues to provide her with
                    illusions. But a clever woman, with highly-strung nerves, tires in the long run
                    of such a life, tires of the new admirer's jealousy of his predecessor, and of
                    fooling herself and another for, say, the tenth time with the words: »You are
                    the only man I have ever loved.« After this life has lost its illusions, <pb n="195"/> and
                    existence for the time being its charm, the possibility of a new illusion
                    presents itself. Madame de Krüdener regards the apoplectic shock which killed
                    her lover in the same light as St. Augustine, Pascal, and Luther regarded
                    similar occurrences. It is a hint, a warning to her. The happy shoemaker tells
                    her of his certainty of being one of the elect of God. When she learns the
                    secret of his happiness, she resolves that she too will be one of the elect.</p>

                <p>Faith in God is in her case the satisfaction of the desire to be elect, to be the
                    chosen one. She believes herself to be converted, and is, at the bottom of her
                    heart, what she was. When she puts into the mouth of the Deity the words in
                    which He assures her of His love, what is she doing but once again writing
                    letters and elegies to Sidonie? The echo of her own self-adoration sounds to her
                    like a voice from heaven, and she thanks God now as she did before for being
                    thus distinguished–by herself. What she desires now as before is to be loved.
                    As Chateaubriand proceeded to his earthly Alhambra via the earthly Jerusalem,
                    she seeks her heavenly Alhambra by the way of the heavenly Zion. The only
                    difference in their cases is, that he wishes to deceive others; she deceives
                    herself. She is a coquette; so is he, and so is Lamartine; they are haughty
                    coquettes, and she is a humble one.</p>

                <p>What chiefly distinguishes her from them is, however, not her character, but her
                    gifts and her feminine nature. Chateaubriand, as a man, has at least a
                    sufficient glimmering of science to make it impossible for him to be imposed on
                    by miracle-workers and village sibyls. Madame de Krüdener is a woman, and in a
                    reactionary age the definition holds good: Woman is the natural prey of the
                    priests. Destitute of any scientific basis of thought, she sooner or later,
                    except in rare, unusually favourable circumstances, becomes a prey to her
                    enthusiasm, which does not know on what to expend itself, to her vague longings
                    after she knows not what, to her cowardice, which is terrified by the calamities
                    of life, to her various illusions; and all these powers–enthusiasm, longing,
                    fear, and imagination–deliver up their victim bound hand and foot as a prey to
                    the Church, whose authority has, <pb n="196"/> moreover, been imprinted upon her soul by her
                    education from her earliest youth. Such was the case with Madame de Krüdener.
                    All that she comes into contact with of the intellectual life of her day–its
                    great wars of liberation, its research, its philosophy, its enthusiasm for
                    enlightenment–passes by her without being understood; the one quality of the
                    spirit of her age that she understands and appropriates is its dissoluteness.
                    When the reaction against the 18th century sets in, and it is, naturally, first
                    and foremost taxed with impiety and frivolity, Madame de Krüdener immediately
                    joins in the cry, because she herself has had no eyes for anything else in it,
                    has comprehended nothing in it but its frivolousness and loose morality.</p>

                <p>The reaction gains strength; it soon has a literature of its own, a literature
                    treating of all those supernatural things which the authors persuade their
                    readers that they believe in. They write whole volumes about thrones and
                    principalities, cherubim and seraphim; they appear to be in sober earnest, but
                    it never occurs to them that any human being will take them seriously. After any
                    amount of ability has been displayed in the championing of tradition, there
                    appears a woman who is simple enough to take everything literally, to believe
                    that Marie Kummer has talked with angels, and that Fontaines has had such
                    supernatural visions as it was the height of the fashion to describe in verse.
                    Poets had begun to hymn the praises of the miracle-worker and the prophet–a
                    poor naïve Magdalen takes them at their word, believes in the miracles which are
                    shown her, and tries her hand at prophesying. We are preparing to shake our
                    heads with a smile, when we perceive that the powers of the day are taking her
                    seriously. She herself becomes a power. Chateaubriand, who neither believes in
                    her nor with her, but who believes in her influence, tries to gain her support
                    for his political projects, but in vain. She has but one desire, to restore to
                    Christianity that authority which the Revolution had destroyed. In her eyes the
                    Revolution has only accomplished one deed, the overthrow of sacred tradition;
                    she, for her part, desires to do only the one, opposite, deed–<pb n="197"/>to give back to
                    Christianity its world-overshadowing power.</p>

                <p>Alexander takes up the idea; the other powers adopt it as a useful political
                    lever. As long as her sole desire is to vindicate the <emph>authority</emph> of
                    Christianity, as long as she aims at improving and converting the nations <emph>from
                    above</emph>, and in concert with their sovereigns, Madame de Krüdener stands upon the
                    pinnacle of honour and glory. But the revulsion comes. The consistent
                    development of her religious tendency compels her to attempt a conversion of the
                    nations <emph>from below</emph>, to go forth among them and, after the manner of the old
                    apostles, practise Christianity in action instead of merely proclaiming it as
                    doctrine. What childishness! So naïve is she that she believes the potentates
                    will regard her new endeavours with the same favour which they showed to her
                    earlier ones. She does not understand that authority dreads all interference
                    with its own principle except official interference. From the moment when she
                    begins really to act as a Christian, she is treated as a revolutionist. In the
                    feeling of the universal brotherhood of humanity which inspires her, and in the
                    enthusiasm with which she pleads the cause of the poor and the oppressed, the
                    champions of authority see proof that she is–a socialist and a communist.</p>

                <p>And thus it fell to Madame de Krüdener's lot to give practical proof of what the
                    rehabilitation of Christianity as authority meant. For it was only as
                    <emph>authority</emph>, as <emph>power</emph>, as <emph>order</emph>, that Christianity was wanted. It was
                    employed as the police, the army, the prisons were employed, to keep everything
                    quiet and support the principle of authority. From the moment when it began to
                    be regarded as a personal matter, as a thing in itself, and to be practised in a
                    manner which threatened to produce social disturbances, from that moment it was
                    <emph>disorder</emph>, and the authorities expedited it, in the person of Madame de
                    Krüdener, as promptly as possible from frontier to frontier.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Sources: Charles Eynard, <emph>Vie de Madame Krüdener</emph>, vols. i. and ii.;

                <p>When the Hundred Days were over, and Louis XVIII, had returned for the second
                    time, a mixed feeling, in which melancholy was the chief ingredient, took
                    possession of the French people. Their king's first return had partaken of the
                    appearance of a recall by the nation. But, seeing that he himself had made no
                    attempt whatever to resist Napoleon with the troops which remained faithful to
                    him, it was not possible to disguise the fact that he had been brought back by
                    the bayonets of foreign armies. Hence in the eyes of the great majority his
                    second accession bore the appearance of a humiliation inflicted upon France.
                    But, on the other hand, it meant the restoration of lawful liberty after the
                    terrible military despotism under which France had now sighed for so many
                    years.</p>

                <p>To literature the restoration of the monarchy was, to all appearance at least, a
                    herald of liberty. After the lapse of twenty-five years, free discussion of
                    ideas was again possible. The heavy hand which had lain so crushingly on the
                    press had been removed. The fettered intellects and suppressed ideas were free
                    to bestir themselves; men were at liberty to investigate into and judge the
                    past, the Empire as well as the Revolution; and no great hindrances were placed
                    in the way of their deliberating the future of France.</p>

                <p>They were free to do it, but had they any inclination? If they had, it was of the
                    slightest. The mood of France was the mood which follows on a long illness or on
                    a war which has ended in defeat. Not that men longed for redress on the field of
                    battle. Towards the close of Napoleon's reign no echo was awakened in their
                    hearts when the cannon in <pb n="199"/> front of the Invalides proclaimed a victory. They
                    longed for peace, as the sick man, exhausted by blood-letting, longs for
                    rest.</p>

                <p>To Frenchmen the idea of living a long, peaceful life once more became a familiar
                    one. For years mothers had trembled when they saw their sons approaching the age
                    of manhood, that is to say, the age at which they became first soldiers and ere
                    long corpses; now they began to hope that these sons had a long life before
                    them. The youths, to whom in their boyhood the rattle of drums and blare of
                    trumpets had been familiar sounds, who even at school had accustomed themselves
                    to the thought of early won honour and an early death, were now obliged to
                    familiarise themselves with the idea of life in time of peace. The natural death
                    to which they now looked forward seemed hideous in comparison with death as it
                    had displayed itself to them heretofore, gloriously beautiful in the purple of
                    victory; what was almost a feeling of disappointment came over them, and they
                    began to brood. Most of the young men who had so long been forced to sacrifice
                    their personal life to the life of the State, the requirements of war, the
                    general aims of their country, welcomed with delight the news that they might
                    break the ranks, and were no longer bound to walk in step behind the drum; they
                    shook the dust of the highways off their feet, threw off their uniforms, and
                    tried to banish every remembrance of military discipline. Coming straight from
                    the battle-fields of the Empire, from the noise and bloodshed of war, they took
                    refuge in the quietness of a country life, far from the bustle and uproar of
                    human crowds. Such was the mood of the moment–a wearied, but complex mood.
                    There was disappointment in it, and hope, and inclination to personal day
                    dreaming. It was not a mood favourable to action, but to brooding, reflection,
                    deliberation.</p>

                <p>This national mood explains how it was possible for such poetry as Lamartine's
                    <emph>Les Méditations</emph> to become the favourite literature of the day. No book since
                    Chateaubriand's <emph>Génie du Christianisme</emph> had made such a sensation as did the
                    First Part of this work; 45,000 copies of it were <pb n="200"/> sold in four years. Strange as
                    it may seem to us now, the Restoration period found in Lamartine's poetry an
                    interpretation of its feelings and of all that moved its inmost heart–a picture
                    of its ideal longings, painted in the clearest, loveliest dream-colours. It was
                    poetry that resembled the music of an Æolian harp, but the wind that played upon
                    the strings was the spirit of the age. The poems were not so much songs as
                    reflections, not so much heart as spirit harmonies; but in real life there had
                    for long been enough, and more than enough, of the positive–definite forms,
                    decided characters, solid substance, silent acceptance of the strokes of fate.
                    It was by no means considered a fault that there was no strong passion in the
                    poems, no tendency to see the dark and dreadful sides of life, or, in fact, life
                    as it is. There had been enough of all this in reality. After a period during
                    which so many instincts had been forcibly suppressed, men rejoiced in this
                    purely poetic instinct, in this most melodious poet, who had, as he himself
                    said, a chord for every feeling and mood. They longed for just such lyric
                    restfulness after philosophy, revolution, and wars without end. The poem <emph>Le
                    Lac</emph> was read with delight by the whole French-speaking world, just because it
                    was so long since men had felt in sympathy with nature, so long since they had
                    looked at the face of the earth from any point of view but the tactical one. It
                    was not only, however, as the poet of feeling that Lamartine represented the
                    spirit of the day; he also represented it in his character of orthodox
                    Christian. The leading note in his poetry was the note of Christian royalism,
                    and devotion to the Bourbon family in particular.</p>

                <p>To us, who are acquainted with a Lamartine in whom the Revolution of 1848 seemed
                    to find its incarnation, a Lamartine who was universally regarded as a prophet
                    of humanism, it is of interest to examine the poet's spiritual
                    starting-point.</p>



                <p>Alphonse de Lamartine was born at Mâcon in 1790, of a family belonging to the
                    ranks of the lesser nobility. His father was one of the king's last faithful
                    adherents at the time of the Revolution, and suffered for his devotion.<!-- Illustration: [LAMARTINE] --> <pb n="201"/> Alphonse's loving, pious mother taught him to read in an illustrated Bible. He
                    thus received his first literary and artistic impressions from scenes in the
                    lives of the Patriarchs, the stories of Joseph and Samuel, of Sarah, and of
                    Tobias and the Angel. After 1794 the family lived a very retired life upon small
                    means on their little property of Milly. The son was at first taught at home by
                    an amiable abbé, then sent to a school at Lyons, the rough, coarse tone of which
                    was terribly repellent to a boy of a naturally refined disposition. By his
                    mother's and his own wish he was removed to a school at Belley, kept by certain
                    Jesuits who had managed to elude the laws banishing them from France, and who
                    called themselves <emph>Fathers of the Faith</emph>. Here young Lamartine felt himself
                    inexpressibly happy. The teachers were kind and refined; one of them reminded
                    him of Fénélon; in the present century the Jesuits are undoubtedly not only the
                    most unscrupulous, but also the most amiable, cleverest, and consequently most
                    dangerous of all ecclesiastics. Amongst his fellow-pupils Lamartine soon found
                    friends of his own standing, scions of French and Sardinian noble families.
                    Among these were a young Alfieri, young Virieu, who, as V., plays a part in
                    Graziella, and a nephew of Joseph de Maistre, Louis de Vignet. Through de Vignet
                    Lamartine made acquaintance with all the members of the famous de Maistre
                    family; Count Joseph attracted him least as a personality, but influenced him
                    both by letters and by his works.</p>

                <p>One day at Belley a master read some passages of Chateaubriand to the boys. The
                    grandeur and charm of the majestic style made the deepest impression upon
                    Lamartine, who had never heard anything like it before. But he declares in his
                    Memoirs that he almost immediately assumed a critical attitude; he fell, he
                    says, into a frenzy of admiration, but »not into a frenzy of bad taste.« And he
                    maintains that he presently, in talking to his comrades about the <emph>Génie du
                    Christianisme</emph>, summed up his objections in the following pronouncement: »The
                    main element in all perfect beauty, naturalness, is wanting. It is beautiful;
                    but it is too beautiful.« In other words, Lamartine, who himself <pb n="202"/> wrote so
                    instinctively, thought Chateaubriand's style strained. It is probable that he
                    slightly antedates this criticism. In any case his admiration was such that as
                    late as 1824, when hymning the consecration of Charles X., he wrote:–</p>

                <p>Tasso was another poet whom Alphonse read with enthusiastic admiration. Ossian
                    taught him that it is possible for true poetry to be vague and misty. Bernardin
                    de Saint-Pierre, with his sweetness and his harmony, was Lamartine's, as well as
                    Madame de Krüdener's, favourite model.</p>

                <p>Some of the entertaining and immoral books of the eighteenth century which fell
                    into the boy's hands delighted him, and excited his youthful imagination for a
                    short time, but these impressions were effaced by those of the Jesuit school. A
                    combination of religious enthusiasm and delight in the freshness and beauty of
                    nature purified his mind and inspired it with activity.</p>

                <p>»Were I to live a thousand years,« he writes in his Memoirs, »I should never
                    forget those days of study, those hours of prayer, those nights spent in
                    meditation, and the raptures of joy with which I fulfilled my duties, thinking
                    all the time of God.« And almost in the same breath he tells of the bliss of
                    skimming in winter on his skates across the frozen marshes, as if borne on
                    spirit wings, or of sitting under the hornbeams in the mild, still spring air,
                    lost in devotional feeling, and happy in perfect peace of conscience.</p>

                <p>The return of the Bourbons was hailed with rejoicing by the Lamartine family,
                    including Alphonse, now a young <pb n="203"/> man. The father (who had been wounded on the
                    10th of August 1792) conducted his son to Paris, and had him enrolled in the
                    King's Guard. It fell one day to the young officer's lot to walk by the King's
                    bath-chair, when he was being wheeled through the galleries of the Louvre to
                    inspect the art treasures brought back by Napoleon from his various campaigns.
                    The profound reverence of the youth's own mind made him imagine Louis's voice to
                    be melodious, his person majestic and distinguished, his glance commanding, his
                    speech brilliant, his silence eloquent. Several times after this the King
                    addressed a few words to him when he was riding by the side of the royal
                    carriage.</p>

                <p>When Napoleon had landed at Cannes and was making his triumphal progress through
                    France, Lamartine followed the Court to the Flemish frontier; there the Guard
                    was disbanded and sent home, and after the Hundred Days Lamartine did not
                    re-enter it, nor did he ever see the King again. But when, in 1820, Louis read
                    the first volume of Lamartine's poems, he remembered their writer as a young
                    officer of his Guard, and sent him, by way of reward, an edition of the poets of
                    ancient Greece and Rome. Lamartine, apropos of this, makes the somewhat hasty
                    remark, that King Louis evidently looked upon himself as an Augustus, who had
                    discovered a Virgil.</p>

                <p>The new poet openly proclaims himself to be a disciple of Chateaubriand and
                    Bonald. In his <emph>Raphael</emph> (chap. 1.) he tells how he came to make Bonald's
                    acquaintance. When he was at Chambéry (in his twenty-fifth year) worshipping the
                    beautiful young Creole celebrated in his poems under the name of Elvire, that
                    lady asked him to write an ode to Bonald, who was a frequent and honoured
                    visitor at her house, Lamartine informs us that all he then knew of Bonald was
                    his name, and the halo shed around it by its owner's fame as a Christian
                    legislator. »I imagined to myself,« he says, »that I was addressing a modern
                    Moses, who derived from the rays of a new Sinai the divine light with which he
                    illuminated human laws.« And so the ode which is to be found in the first
                    collection of Lamar<pb n="204"/>tine's poems under the title <emph>Le Génie</emph> was written. In it
                    the young poet affirms–</p>
                

                <cit><quote><lg>

                </lg></quote></cit>


                <p>Here, as everywhere, we come upon that meagre conception of good–order. Bonald
                    responded by sending Lamartine a complete edition of his works. The poet read
                    them with enthusiasm. In notes appended to his ode at a later period he denies
                    that they made any really profound impression on him; but he is confusing his
                    earlier with his later conviction. He writes: »I read these works with that
                    poetical enthusiasm for the past and that emotional reverence inspired by ruins
                    which youthful imagination so easily transforms into dogma and doctrine. For
                    some months I tried to believe, on the authority of Chateaubriand and Bonald, in
                    revealed governments; but in my case, as in other people's, the tendency of the
                    day and the development of human reason dispelled these beautiful illusions, and
                    I comprehended that God reveals nothing to man but his social inclinations, and
                    that the various systems of government are revelations of the age, of
                    circumstances, of the vices and virtues of humanity.« It is certain that
                    Lamartine considerably antedates this conviction of his. All the <emph>Méditations</emph>
                    are in the same tone as the ode to Bonald. The one entitled <emph>Dieu</emph> is dedicated
                    to Lamennais, the dithyramb on the subject of sacred poetry to Genoude, the
                    translator of the Bible. Lamartine himself wrote for <emph>Le Conservateur</emph>, a
                    newspaper from the first appearance of which Chateaubriand dated the pronounced
                    European reaction; and when this paper was given up, he, along with Lamennais
                    and Bonald, started a new one on the same lines, <emph>Le Défenseur</emph>, the special aim
                    of which was to oppose constitutional government. It fell to Lamartine's lot to
                    solicit a contribution from Joseph de Maistre. It is significant that our poet,
                    who by this time was aged thirty, should write to the <pb n="205"/> author of <emph>Du Pape</emph> in
                    such a tone as this: »Monsieur le Comte! At the time I received your book and
                    your kind and flattering letter, I was very ill. I employ my earliest returning
                    strength to thank you for both, but specially for the honour you do me in
                    calling me nephew, a title of which I boast to all who know you. It is a title
                    which in itself is a reputation, in such estimation is your name held by all
                    those who in this misled and contemptible age understand true and profound
                    genius. M. de Bonald and you, Monsieur le Comte, and one or two others who at a
                    distance follow in your steps, have founded an imperishable school of high
                    philosophy and Christian politics, the influence of which is steadily
                    increasing, especially among the younger generation.«</p>

                <p>In this same letter Lamartine defines Joseph de Maistre's position in literature
                    to be that of leader of the best writers, and attributes the antagonism to him
                    to »that absurd Gallican presumption« which De Maistre has discountenanced in a
                    manner worthy of all admiration. Lamartine, thus, unmistakably favours the
                    unlimited ecclesiastical authority of the Pope–but, note well, only in theory.
                    In his poetry he is not nearly so dogmatic. When, for example–responding to
                    Chateaubriand's appeal–he considers it his duty, as a Christian poet, to drive
                    heathen mythology out of poetry, it is not really a pious, but an artistic
                    instinct by which he is inspired. The old myths had, as far as lyric poetry was
                    concerned, long ago dwindled into mere allegories or paraphrases, things far too
                    vapid to have an injurious effect upon any one's religion. A crusade against
                    faith in Apollo and Amor was a perfectly unnecessary undertaking.</p>

                <p>Lamartine's influence was due to the fact that he uttered, now the sad, now the
                    comforting, now the inspiring words which thousands craved to hear. They did not
                    feel the want of new thoughts in his utterances; they were moved by the sound of
                    his sympathetic voice. They felt once more vibrating within them fibres which,
                    during the period of universal depression, had been completely benumbed; he
                    conjured tones from strings which had <pb n="206"/> long given forth no sound; and men
                    delighted in the novelty which consisted in a revival of old memories. But,
                    besides all this, there was one really new element. For Lamartine the ugly and
                    the bad, nay, even the petty and the mean, did not exist. He clothed everything
                    in a garment of shining light. There was a heavenly radiance over his poetry.
                    For the first time for long years, a wealth of beautiful feeling found
                    expression in melodious verse.</p>

                <p>The great naturalist Cuvier, in his speech on the occasion of Lamartine's
                    reception into the Academy in 1830, declared that men, in the profound obscurity
                    which surrounds their reason, require a leader who can snatch them out of the
                    black perplexity of doubt and draw them along with him into the region of light
                    and certainty. He accused Byron of having seen nothing in the universe but a
                    temple for the God of evil, and greeted Lamartine as the poet of hope. Thus did
                    France, like some poor creature recovering from a dangerous illness, confuse
                    hope with belief, comfort with dogma, vital energy with determined vindication
                    of Papal authority–until at last the force of circumstances dispelled the mist,
                    and forced men of letters as well as the general public to adopt definite
                    standpoints.</p>

                <p>Even later than this, Lamartine was still the man of the period. Only four months
                    before the outbreak of the Revolution of July, a eulogium of Daru is prescribed
                    as the theme of his oration before the French Academy. He accomplishes the feat
                    of pronouncing it without naming Napoleon's name; and he says frankly: »This
                    century will be dated from our double restoration of lost blessings, the
                    restoration of liberty by the throne and of the throne by liberty.... Let us not
                    forget that our future is inseparably bound up with that of our kings, that it
                    is impossible to separate the tree from its root without drying up the trunk,
                    and that in our country it is monarchy which has borne everything, even the
                    perfect fruit of liberty.«</p>

                <p>Lamartine now enjoys a period of triumph, the period of budding fame. Fame did
                    not come to him early, for he was thirty years old; but it penetrated like the
                    first rays of <pb n="207"/> the rising sun into his ambitious soul. Let us picture to
                    ourselves a salon in the days of Louis XVIII, as described by writers of the
                    day. About a hundred persons are assembled in a suite of drawing-rooms in the
                    house of some important personage, say General Foy. Lamartine, then an attaché
                    of the embassy in Florence, but for the moment in Paris on one of his short
                    visits, is among the invited guests.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Villemain, <emph>M. de Féletz et les salons de son temps</emph>.</note> A movement of admiration passes through
                    the assembly as he enters–young, erect, handsome, aristocratic in mien and
                    bearing. A crowd, chiefly of ladies, gathers round him; he is conscious of
                    charming faces, splendid toilettes, smiles and flattery on every side. People
                    forget for a moment to offer their congratulations to the deputies present on
                    their last speeches. Even those who have not seen Lamartine before know him at
                    once, for he outshines all. General Foy goes up to him, enthusiastically presses
                    his hand, and assures him that it is in his power, whenever he chooses, to
                    become an ornament of the Chamber, which has long stood in need of just such a
                    talented champion of the sacred principles of royalty. Then Lamartine, in the
                    melodious voice which as yet has never uttered a political catchword, repeats
                    one or two of his first poems–<emph>L'Enthousiasme, Souvenir, Le Désespoir, La
                    Prière, La Foi</emph>, or some such reflective pieces–thereby producing boundless
                    ecstasy, and calling forth outbursts of every shade of enthusiasm and gratitude.
                    Benjamin Constant comes up with his impenetrable, solemnly ironic mien,
                    congratulates him on having discovered this new fountain of poetical
                    inspiration, and assures him that he knows of no such loftiness and purity of
                    thought and expression except in Schiller's reflective poems. The ladies are of
                    opinion that this comparison is very flattering indeed to Schiller, an unknown
                    German bourgeois poet, whose name they just remember having heard. What is he
                    compared with Lamartine!</p>

                <p>Various circumstances contributed to heighten the effect produced by the poems
                    themselves–in the first place, the uncommon and almost feminine personal beauty
                    of their author; in the second, the rumours in circulation regard<pb n="208"/>ing the lady
                    whose praises were sung with such seraphic enthusiasm, such supernatural purity.
                    It was reported that the poet had loved, and that death had deprived him of the
                    object of his affections. Much trouble was taken to discover the actual
                    circumstances of the case. Who was this Elvire? What was her real name?</p>

                <p>We of to-day have been sufficiently enlightened by Lamartine's own later prose
                    works, but with the satisfaction of curiosity on this subject interest in
                    Lamartine's lyric poetry is not extinguished.</p>

                <p>It was natural that the contemporaries of the youthful Lamartine should see in
                    him first and foremost the poet of the throne and the altar. His earliest
                    published poem was a heart-felt expression of gratitude to the Jesuit school
                    which had sheltered him in his boyhood. Such a poem as his Ode was simply the
                    essence of Chateaubriand's <emph>Génie du Christianisme</emph> versified. His lines on the
                    birth of the Duke of Bordeaux (Comte de Chambord), after the death of his
                    father, the Duc de Berry, with their refrain: »He is born, the miraculous
                    child!« expressed the feelings of the most loyal Catholics. And on every
                    occasion, in almost all of the poems, he lauds and magnifies, justifies and
                    adores God, Providence. At times, as for instance in the poem <emph>La Semaine
                    Sainte</emph>, written during a visit to the young Duc de Rohan, who later in life
                    became an archbishop and a cardinal, his verse is almost like a fervently
                    devotional burning of incense. If he is to be taken at his word when he asserts,
                    in writing of this poem many years afterwards, that he alone, among the young
                    men who gathered round the Duke, had no relish whatever for the church's mystic
                    joys, all we can conclude is that his poetic talent was carried away by the
                    current of the tendency of the day.</p>

                <p>Most of the purely religious poetry of Lamartine's youthful period is, from its
                    want of simplicity and real feeling, almost unreadable nowadays. It is not
                    lyric; it is not concise; it is reflection without matter, meditation without
                    thoughts, breadth without depth. A good example is the poem dedicated to Byron,
                    entitled <emph>L'Homme</emph>. The French poet's conception of his English contemporary is
                    the <pb n="209"/> traditional, stereotyped, inexpressibly silly one of the day, namely, that
                    he touches only the chords of despair, that his eye, like Satan's, fathoms
                    abysses, &amp;c. To show Byron how the true poet ought to sing, Lamartine
                    strikes up the most servile hymn of praise to a God who, he himself tells us,
                    plagues, tortures, plunders, overwhelms with misfortune and misery, and
                    concludes with the exhortation:</p>

                </lg></quote></cit>


                <p>The notes appended at a later period to this poem betray an astonishing ignorance
                    of Lord Byron's history; almost everything affirmed of him is incorrect. Though
                    Lamartine added a poem to Child Harold, he never so much as learned to spell the
                    name correctly.</p>

                <p>The same admonitory tone which he here assumes towards Byron he adopted many
                    years later in writing of Alfred de Musset, to whom he also offered pious and
                    moral truisms as medicaments.</p>

                <p>The piety which Lamartine felt in duty bound to display is less offensive,
                    because more sincere, in the ode entitled <emph>L'Immortalité</emph>. This poem is
                    addressed to the beloved of his youth, Elvire, whose scepticism was a great
                    grief to him, and its aim is to comfort her on her death-bed with the prospect
                    of an immortality in which until now she has refused to believe. But even here
                    we have such frigid allegorical ideas as: »And Hope, standing by thy side, O
                    Death! dreaming upon a grave, opens to me a fairer world.«</p>

                <p>In only one of the poems which invoke the Deity is Lamartine really the lyric
                    poet and not merely the fluent verse-writer, namely in <emph>Le Désespoir</emph>, a
                    Meditation which expresses revolt against our idea of God. In this poem we have
                    rhythmic flow, passion, and two qualities rarely found in Lamartine's
                    productions–vigour and conciseness. What has God seen since the creation of the
                    world?</p>

                <p><pb n="210"/> And in its original form the poem contained verses, suppressed at the time of
                    publication, which expressed sentiments far more bitter and impious than these.
                    It is characteristic that almost immediately after the appearance of <emph>Le
                    Désespoir</emph>, Lamartine, at his mother's request, refuted the ideas it expressed
                    in a reply-poem, <emph>Dieu à l'Homme</emph>, which, though not wanting in melodious
                    sonority, is, as even its author perceived, not to be compared with the first.
                    The first, he himself correctly observes, is the product of inspiration, the
                    second of reflection.</p>

                <p>But all the theological trappings were, as one might say, only glued on to
                    Lamartine's poetry. Or one might perhaps with more propriety liken them to a
                    carelessly constructed raft, which for a time floats upon the bosom of the
                    stream and then breaks up into its component parts and disappears. All this
                    pious dogmatism soon resolved itself into love of nature, worship of nature, a
                    sincerely religious philosophy of nature.</p>

                <p>What really lived and breathed in those early poems was something independent of
                    their religious dogmatism, namely, the whole emotional life of a gentle, yet
                    dignified soul. The soul which found expression in them had this characteristic
                    of the new century, that it loved solitude, and only in solitude found itself
                    and felt itself rich. It was an unsociable soul, only disposed to vibrate in
                    harmony with nature. It was sad and pathetically earnest; under no circumstances
                    whatever cheerful or gay. And, finally, it was never erotic; one only of the
                    poems was an expression of the happiness of satisfied love; the feeling
                    pervading all the rest was sorrow over the loss of the loved one, whom death had
                    claimed as his prey. The poetry of the eighteenth century had resolved love into
                    gallantry, had taken neither it nor woman seriously, but in this new poetry love
                    was the silent worship of a memory, and woman was adored and glorified as she
                    had been in the days of the Minnesingers; only now it was woman as the departed
                    one, as the spirit.</p>

                <p>Never did Lamartine depict the wild grief of loss at the moment of the loss; in
                    his poems grief has become a <pb n="211"/> condition, a silent despair which blunts, stiffens,
                    tortures, and at a rare time dissolves into tears.</p>

                <p>This new song was song which flowed naturally from its fountain, plentiful and
                    pure; it was music like harp-strains blended with the tones of celestial
                    violins. And, borne on these tones, simple, familiar emotions communicated
                    themselves to the reader's mind, such thoughts as that of the poem <emph>La
                    Retraite</emph>–happiness awaits me nowhere; or of <emph>L'Automne</emph>–nature's autumnal
                    mourning garb harmonises with my sorrow and is pleasant to my eyes; or of <emph>Le
                    Golfe de Baya</emph>–this spot, once the scene of such great events, preserves not a
                    trace of them; in like manner we ourselves shall disappear, leaving no trace
                    behind. But, note well; a thought like this last was expressed in such
                    wonderfully beautiful lines as the following:</p>

                    <l>Hélas! sans laisser plus de trace</l>
                    <l>Que cette barque où nous glissons</l>
                    <l>Sur cette mer où tout s'efface.</l>

                <p>There was never any systematic description of nature, or any attempt at painting;
                    the momentary impression of nature was caught, even as it passed, by genius, and
                    preserved for all time.</p>

                <p>The poet is sitting at evening on the bare mountain side. Venus rises above the
                    horizon (<emph>Le Soir</emph>). A ray from the star seems to glide across his brow and
                    touch his eyes, and he feels as if the departed one, in whose companionship he
                    had lived here, were hovering near him. He addresses the ray from Venus:</p>

                    <l>Mon cœur à ta clarté s'enflamme,</l>

                    <l>Je songe à ceux qui ne sont plus:</l>
                    <l>Douce lumière, es-tu leur âme?</l>
                </lg></quote></cit>


                <p>Or, sitting on a rock by the lake (<emph>Le Bourget</emph>), where in bygone happy days he
                    had sat by her side, he is painfully affected by the feeling of the mutability
                    of everything human as compared with the unchangeableness of inanimate nature. <pb n="212"/> This is the emotion to which he gives expression in his poem <emph>Le Lac</emph>, which, in
                    spite of its extraordinary popularity, is probably the best he ever wrote. It is
                    an excellent type of his poetry; flowing gently, with no exertion perceptible,
                    not even that exertion which we call art, it is as naturally melodious as the
                    rippling of the lake. The emotion which the poet desires to express is indicated
                    with admirable precision in the metaphor with which the first verse concludes:
                    Is it impossible to cast anchor on the ocean of time even for a single day? The
                    lake is described with its waves breaking upon the rocks as they did a year ago,
                    when the beloved one heard their murmur; and the bereaved lover recalls the
                    words which she spoke in the stillness of night, as their boat floated on the
                    waters–an invocation to time, that happy time, to stay its flight, a prayer to
                    it to hasten for the unhappy and suffering, but to linger with those who love
                    and are beloved. He repeats her concluding cry: Prayer is fruitless; let us love
                    one another and enjoy the passing hour! For man there is no haven, time has no
                    shore; it flows on and we disappear. On this memory of the thoughts of his dead
                    love follows the poet's own invocation to nature. He invokes the lake, the
                    silent rocks, the caves, the dark woods, the things which time spares and those
                    which it re-animates, and beseeches them to preserve the remembrance of that
                    night.</p>

                <p>And Lamartine, so spiritual in his expression of the grief and loneliness of the
                    bereaved lover, is almost as spiritual when for once he gives expression to
                    happy love. This he does in <emph>Chant d'amour</emph>, a poem which he himself naïvely
                    describes as a modern Song of Solomon, quieter in tone and less Oriental in
                    colouring than the old, but which in reality has as little resemblance to that
                    song as the chastest spirituality of the West has to the glowing sensuality of
                    the East. Here, as elsewhere, the chord which he touches is the chord of
                    plaintive tenderness, gradually modulating into that of religious devotion.</p>

                <p>Of Lamartine's youthful verse these purely human poems are all that we really
                    care for nowadays. We are terribly bored by the vapid compositions which,
                    following the pre<pb n="213"/>scribed rule for religious poetry, consist of nothing but
                    adoration of the Deity as he reveals himself in his works.</p>

                <p>The poet whose acquaintance we make in the human poems is unmistakably very vain,
                    much engrossed with himself and his own lovableness, and at times too honeyed in
                    his language. But his vanity is so childlike and innocent that it does not
                    affect us unpleasantly; and we are favourably impressed by the fact that it is
                    not literary vanity. Lamartine rejoices that he is good-looking, a favourite
                    with distinguished women, a good horseman, in course of time an eloquent orator;
                    but he is not conceited about his poetical gifts, not even proud of them. The
                    man whose talent was that of the true improvisatore with proud humility
                    describes himself in his prefaces and memoirs as one who cultivates art for his
                    pleasure, and who does not belong to the number of the specially initiated. And
                    he really is the dilettante in so far as he is too careless to be called a true
                    artist. He has unconscious technique, he has flexibility and ease, but along
                    with these an inclination to long-windedness and repetition which at times
                    spoils his effects, and a want of the power of self-criticism which makes it
                    difficult, nay, almost impossible, for him to correct and improve. Nevertheless,
                    all his life long he was a poet, a true poet–in spite of his artistic defects
                    one of the most genuine whom France has produced. It was not his fault that he
                    made his appearance in literature under the unpropitious planet of the reaction
                    period.</p>

                <p>It was under the influence of the same planet that the man destined to become the
                    most famous French poet of the nineteenth century won a name for himself. Victor
                    Hugo, born in 1802, is for a long period of his life as good a Catholic and
                    royalist as Lamartine, his senior by twelve years. Hugo's literary career
                    corresponds closely with the political career of the French nation. He is an
                    adherent of the Bourbons as long as they are the reigning family. When the
                    Revolution of July takes place, he sympathises with it, and he is an adherent of
                    the new monarchy from the moment it is founded. During the reign of King Louis
                    Philippe, at whose court he is a frequent guest, he becomes an enthusi<pb n="214"/>astic
                    eulogist of Napoleon when the cult of Napoleon is revived in France. He warmly
                    supports the candidature of Louis Napoleon for the post of President of the
                    Republic, continues to lend him his support when he occupies that post, and is
                    even favourable to the idea of an empire, until the feeling that he is despised
                    as a politician estranges him from the Prince-President, and resentment at the
                    <emph>coup d'état</emph> drives him into the camp of the extreme Republicans. His life may
                    be said to mirror the political movements of France during the first half of the
                    century. He was, as is so often the case with poets, not a leading spirit, but
                    an organ.</p>

                <p>In the last preface to his <emph>Odes et Ballades</emph> Hugo, in his pompous manner, writes
                    of his own career: »History goes into ecstasies over Michel Ney, who, born a
                    cooper, became a marshal of France, and over Murat, who, born an ostler, became
                    a king. The obscurity of their origin is considered to give them an additional
                    claim to respect, and to add to the glory of the position to which they have
                    attained. Of all the ladders which lead from darkness to light, the one which it
                    is most difficult and most meritorious to mount by is undoubtedly that which
                    leads from the position of loyal aristocrat to that of democrat. To rise from a
                    hut to a palace is, no doubt, an uncommon and admirable achievement, but to rise
                    from error to truth is more uncommon and more admirable. In the case of the
                    first ascent, the man gains something, increases his comfort, his power, his
                    wealth, with every upward step; in the case of the second, exactly the opposite
                    happens ... he must pay for his spiritual growth with one sacrifice of temporal
                    well-being after another ... and if it is true that Murat could with pride lay
                    his postillion's whip beside his sceptre, saying: 'This is what I began with,'
                    then certainly the poet may with more justifiable pride and greater inward
                    satisfaction point to the royalist odes which he wrote as a child and youth, and
                    lay them beside the democratic poems and works which he has written as a grown
                    man. And the pride is perhaps especially justifiable in one who at the end of
                    his ascent, on the topmost step of the ladder<!-- Illustration: [VICTOR HUGO] --> <pb n="215"/> of light, has found banishment, in
                    the man who can date this preface from exile.«</p>


                <p>Victor Hugo was the son of one of Napoleon's officers who had originally been a
                    violent revolutionist, and as such had exchanged his Christian name, Joseph, for
                    that of Brutus, which, however, he dropped again when the Revolution was at an
                    end. Joseph Hugo was at Besançon, in command of a battalion, when his famous son
                    was born. A few weeks later he was sent to Corsica. From Corsica he was
                    transferred to Elba, thence to Genoa and the Italian army. He entered the
                    service of Napoleon's brother Joseph when Joseph became King of Naples, and at
                    Naples his wife and children joined him in October 1807. When in 1808 Joseph was
                    made King of Spain, Colonel Hugo followed him to that country, sending his wife
                    and three little sons to Paris, where they lived from 1808 till 1811. In the
                    spring of 1811 they accompanied a strong detachment of troops to Madrid, but
                    Hugo thought it prudent to send them back to Paris in the following year, while
                    he himself, who had been promoted with extraordinary rapidity to be aide-de-camp
                    to the King, major-domo of the palace, general, Count of Cisuentes,
                    inspector-general of the Peninsular army, and governor of three provinces, took
                    part in the war until the defeat of Vittoria, in June 1813, obliged Joseph to
                    abdicate. Napoleon, who could not bear General Hugo, and always treated him
                    badly, refused to confirm his appointment as general and his title as count (his
                    other preferments he had lost), and ordered him to enter the French army again
                    with the rank of major. In 1814 and 1815 Joseph Hugo distinguished himself by
                    his able defence of the fortress of Thionville. His son writes of him as if he
                    had been an ardent votary of Napoleon. This he most certainly was not, and when
                    the Bourbons returned they at once gained his complete allegiance by restoring
                    him to his rank of general, with promotion dating from 1809, the year in which
                    he had received it from King Joseph. Thus it was not only Victor Hugo's mother,
                    the daughter of a loyal shipowner of the Breton town of Nantes, who was a
                    devoted royalist; his father, too, was strongly attached to the restored royal
                    house. <pb n="216"/> Causes entirely unconnected with politics produced a misunderstanding
                    between the parents, and they separated. The sons, Abel, Eugène, and Victor,
                    remained with their mother in Paris.</p>

                <p>All three possessed literary ability, though only the youngest lived long enough
                    to display his full power and win fame. All three were, to begin with, champions
                    of royalty and the church. Victor said as a boy: »I will be Chateaubriand, or no
                    one.«</p>

                <p>After winning prizes for their poems in Paris and at Toulouse, the three
                    brothers, with the view of earning a living, started a literary periodical (in
                    1819). Chateaubriand was at this time editing the extreme Conservative newspaper
                    <emph>Le Conservateur</emph>. The brothers named their venture <emph>Le Conservateur
                    littéraire</emph>, and Chateaubriand gave it a warm welcome. The new periodical came
                    out twice a month until March 1821, and Victor Hugo alone supplied more poems
                    and articles than all the other contributors together. In <emph>Le Conservateur
                    littéraire</emph> are already to be found some of his most famous odes–<emph>Les Vierges
                    de Verdun</emph>, the odes on the fate of La Vendée, on the death of the Duke of
                    Berri, on the birth of the Duke of Bordeaux, and the beautiful, more personal
                    song of rejoicing on the occasion of the restoration of the statue of Henry IV.
                    And in it we also find, to the number of over a hundred, his first essays in
                    criticism, of which only a few, and these much tampered with, have been included
                    in the collection entitled <emph>Littérature et Philosophie mêlées</emph>.</p>

                <p>At this period poetry is to Victor Hugo the daughter of religion. Apropos of an
                    ode on the existence of God, he writes: »The desire to thank a bountiful God in
                    language worthy of Him begat poetry. From its birth it shared in the triumphs of
                    religion, which united the earliest societies and began the civilisation of the
                    world. At the present day, when, in order to demolish society, men attack
                    religion, the only bridle upon man, the only lasting tie which holds societies
                    together, it is not surprising that they should seek to make an ally of poetry.
                    But the divine muse does not allow herself to be inspired by that which is
                    nought.«</p>

                <p>And at this period, too, he proclaims the superiority of <pb n="217"/> Corneille and Racine to
                    Shakespeare and Schiller: »We have never understood the difference alleged to
                    exist between classic and romantic art. Shakespeare's and Schiller's dramas
                    differ from Corneille's and Racine's only in being more faulty.«</p>

                <p>The first edition of Victor Hugo's <emph>Odes</emph> appeared in 1822. Louis XVIII., who
                    read them over and over again, settled an annuity of 1000 francs a year on the
                    poet out of his private purse; in the following year the Ministry of the
                    Interior conferred on him a pension of 2000 francs; and in 1826 the King, on
                    being applied to, increased the amount of his yearly grant.</p>

                <p>The King had good reason to show approval, for these first poems of Victor Hugo
                    contain the whole system of orthodox political and religious principles valid
                    under the Bourbon monarchy. They are a faithful image of the period during which
                    they were written.</p>

                <p>They pass in review the history of France from 1789 to 1825. In those of them
                    which treat of the Revolution we observe, as in the corresponding poems by
                    Lamartine, that two words occur more frequently than any others–executioners
                    and victims. In the history of the Revolution Hugo sees nothing else. For its
                    leading spirits he has but this one designation–executioners; the Convention he
                    describes as a creation of the devil (livre i. ode 4); and, little as he loves
                    heathen mythology, he cannot resist using the expression, <emph>Hydra</emph> of anarchy,
                    when he wishes to depict the horrors of the revolutionary period. For the
                    enemies of the Revolution victims is the stereotyped designation; the revolt of
                    La Vendée is eulogised in every second poem, and odes are addressed to its
                    heroes and heroines (<emph>La Vendée, Quiberon, Mlle. Sombreuil</emph>). The guillotine is
                    always present to the poet's imagination, and is the constant object of his
                    anathemas, except when, as in the ode <emph>Le Dévouement</emph> (livre iv. ode 4), he is
                    carried away to the extent of desiring martyrdom for himself, »because the
                    martyrs' angel is the most beautiful of all the angels who bear the souls of men
                    to heaven.«</p>

                <p>Following in the footprints of Chateaubriand, Victor <pb n="218"/> Hugo goes back to the
                    Christian martyrs of ancient Rome, and in no fewer than four odes (<emph>Le repas
                    libre, L'homme heureux, Le chant du cirque, Un chant de fête de Néron</emph>)
                    describes the agonising triumph of the martyrs over the brutal and voluptuous
                    cruelty to which they in outward appearance succumb. And the symbolism, too, is
                    the same as in Chateaubriand's poetry; it is the death of the orthodox noble or
                    priest which is represented under the form of the butcheries of the circus.</p>

                <p>One of the finest of these poems of the Revolution is the oldest, written in
                    memory of a little company of innocent young girls who, under the Reign of
                    Terror, were executed after a long imprisonment without being brought to trial,
                    on the vague and incorrect suspicion that they had testified pleasure when the
                    Prussians entered their town (<emph>Les vierges de Verdun</emph>). Hugo paints the tribunal
                    of the Convention blacker than is necessary, by crediting the public prosecutor,
                    Fouquier-Tinville, with impure designs upon his victims and putting insulting
                    proposals into his mouth; but even without the addition of unhistorical
                    incidents, the sentence of these girls was so shameful, their fate so tragic,
                    and their behaviour so beautiful and dignified, that they well deserved a poetic
                    monument, even a better one than Hugo raised to them.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Any one interested in their real story will find it told according to the
                        original historical documents in Cuvillier-Fleury's <emph>Portraits Politiques</emph>,
                        1851, pp. 377, &amp;c.</note></p>

                <p>The poet's pathos is entirely justifiable in cases like this, where the
                    Revolution showed its dark and unjust side in its dealings with youth and
                    innocence, but it becomes grating and false as soon as his dogmas come into
                    play. His tone in writing of the monarchy and the glories of royalty is
                    positively insufferable. In the Ode to Louis XVIII. God calls upon the seraphs,
                    the prophets, and the archangels to do obeisance to the newly arrived heir to
                    the throne: »Courbez-vous, c'est un Roi.« And not content with this, the Deity
                    Himself calls him by his title, not his name: »O Roi!« and reminds him that
                    <emph>God's own Son was, like him, a king with a crown of thorns</emph>. In the poem on the
                    occasion of the baptism of the Comte de Chambord, the language is even stronger:
                    »God has given us one of His <pb n="219"/> angels, <emph>as He gave us His Son in the days of
                    old</emph>.« We are reminded that the water of the river Jordan (brought home by
                    Chateaubriand) in which the child has been baptized is the same in which Jesus
                    was baptized; it is the will of Heaven, we are told, »that the reassured world
                    should, even by the very water used for his baptism, recognise a <emph>Saviour</emph>.« In
                    <emph>La Vision</emph> the eighteenth century is summoned before the judgment-seat of God,
                    and there accused of having in the pride of its knowledge mocked at the dogmas
                    which are the support of the law and of morality. It timidly expresses the hope
                    that the future will view its actions in a more favourable light, but it is
                    mercilessly condemned; the »guilty century« is plunged into the abyss, pursued
                    as it falls by the inexorable voice of the judge.</p>

                <p>The standpoint from which Napoleon (who is always called Buonaparte) is viewed
                    harmonises with that from which the Revolution is judged; he is the usurper, the
                    savage soldier, the murderer of Enghien; and again and again it is impressed on
                    us that lilies are better than laurels. Under the name of Colonel G. A.
                    Gustaffson (livre iii. ode 5), Gustavus IV., who lived as an exile in France
                    during the reign of Louis XVIII, is eulogised as the representative of the
                    fallen kings. The personality and story of Gustavus are represented in a manner
                    which witnesses to Hugo's remarkable ignorance of foreign history–the king's
                    whole life is a model life; his great mind is like a temple, whence proceeds the
                    voice of God; he dictates the history of the future; he is the successor of the
                    ancient seers; actuated by disgust at seeing the monarchs bow their necks to
                    Napoleon's yoke, he has voluntarily taken off his crown, and thereby raised his
                    head high above all the other royal heads on earth. Could folly go farther than
                    this? The wretched, insane Gustavus a model king! The Bourbons are of course
                    exalted to the skies. All their family events–birth, baptism, death, ascension,
                    consecration–are treated as of world-wide import. In a poem on the subject of
                    the reprehensible war which France, at Chateaubriand's instigation, carried on
                    with Spain in the interests of the European reaction, royalty, the royal power,
                    is declared to be miraculous; and in the same poem <pb n="220"/> the king is expressly
                    described as the war-lord, supporting himself by the power of the sword; war is,
                    we are told, the companion of royalty:</p>

                <p>It is not surprising that all these odes should have mottoes taken either from
                    the Bible or from religious works, notably Chateaubriand's <emph>Les Martyrs</emph>, a book
                    by which men's minds were so powerfully impressed that the younger poets of the
                    day took a pride in transposing whole pages of it into verse.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">For example, Émile Deschamps, <emph>Poésies</emph>, edition of 1841, p. 124. »Une page
                        des martyrs.«</note> Lamartine
                    addressed his ode <emph>Le Génie</emph> to Bonald; Hugo dedicates an ode with the same name
                    to Chateaubriand, of whom he writes that »he suffers the double martyrdom of
                    genius and virtue.«</p>

                <p>He addresses several poems to Lamartine–it is his desire, he writes, to go into
                    battle on the same war-chariot as his friend, to manage the horses while
                    Lamartine wields the spear–and these poems are among the most attractive of
                    all, partly because they are remarkably beautiful, and testify to the respectful
                    and yet at the same time brotherly feeling of the younger for the elder poet,
                    partly because in them we have, along with Hugo's views on religious and social
                    questions, the expression of his ideas on the subject of art. All the poems
                    prove with what earnestness, but also with what exaggerated and almost offensive
                    self-consciousness, the young poet has apprehended his mission–it is always
                    called a prophet's mission; the poet is a seer, a shepherd of the people; of
                    Lamartine, Hugo goes the length of declaring that one feels as if God had
                    revealed Himself to him face to face. But it is in the poems to Lamartine that
                    we <pb n="221"/> perceive most clearly what is Hugo's conception of the position and relation
                    of the new literature to that of the eighteenth century. It bears a remarkable
                    resemblance to a kindred literary phenomenon in Denmark, namely, Oehlenschläger
                    and his friends' conception of their position to Baggesen. Read, for example,
                    the poem <emph>La Lyre et la Harpe</emph> (livre iv. ode 2). The lyre represents the
                    frivolous, licentious poetry of the preceding century, which chants the praises
                    of Jupiter, Mars, Apollo, and Eros, and inculcates an intellectual epicureanism,
                    whereas in the tones of the harp we hear the admonition to watch and pray, to
                    remember the seriousness of life, to think of death, to support and help our
                    stumbling brethren. The poem is dedicated to »Alph. de L.«; the word harp in
                    itself pointed to Lamartine.</p>

                <p>This offensive attitude towards the past is the first symptom of the approaching
                    breach with that past's whole system of ideas, from which Hugo's significance as
                    an author and leader of a literary movement dates.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Lamartine, <emph>Mémoires; Voyage en Orient; Méditations poétiques; Nouvelles

                <p>Of great significance as regards the whole character of the period is the answer
                    to the question: What is the nature of the amatory sentiment in the writings of
                    the authors of this group?</p>

                <p>Of all the emotions treated of in literature the emotion of love is that which
                    receives most attention, and as a rule makes most impression on the reader.
                    Knowledge of the manner in which it is apprehended and represented is an
                    important factor in any real understanding of the spirit of an age. In the age's
                    conception of the passion of love we have, as it were, a gauge by which we can
                    measure with extreme accuracy the force, the nature, the temperature of its
                    whole emotional life. We see gallantry transformed into passion in the works of
                    Rousseau. In the writings of Germany's great poets this passion is chastened and
                    humanised. The German Romanticists turn love into a sort of moonlight
                    sentimentality. In revolutionary times it is represented as at war with existing
                    and regular social relations. In the works of the sceptical authors of the
                    nineteenth century, such as Heine, it is undermined by doubt of its
                    existence.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">

                <p>In such a period as that at present under consideration, a period which rejects
                    the claims of the body, pins its faith to authority, and prizes order above all
                    things, love necessarily receives a characteristic imprint. If we glance at the
                    most notable descriptions of love which the period has bequeathed to us, we gain
                    some idea of its main types of humanity, male and female.</p>

                <p><pb n="223"/> The first pair to meet our eyes are Eudore and Velléda in <emph>Les Martyrs</emph>.</p>

                <p>The hero of <emph>Les Martyrs</emph> is peculiarly interesting to us because Chateaubriand
                    has painted him with many of the features of his own expressive countenance. So
                    great is the similarity of their circumstances that the words and the
                    reflections with which Chateaubriand and Eudore begin to tell the stories of
                    their lives are almost identical. Eudore says: »Born at the foot of Mount
                    Taygetus, the melancholy murmur of the sea was the first sound that fell upon my
                    ear. On how many shores have I since then watched those waves break that I am
                    now gazing on! Who could have told me a few short years ago that I should hear
                    the waves moaning on the beaches of Italy, on the shores of the Batavians, the
                    Britons, and the Gauls, which I then saw laving the bright sands of Messenia?«
                    And Chateaubriand, in his <emph>Voyage en Italie</emph>, writes: »Born on the rocky shores
                    of Brittany, the first sound which fell on my ear when I came into the world was
                    the roar of the sea; and on how many shores have I since then seen the billows
                    break on which I am now gazing! Who could have told me a few short years ago
                    that I should hear moaning by the graves of Scipio and Virgil the waves that
                    rolled at my feet on English beaches and the shores of Maryland?« &amp;c.</p>

                <p>Both these heroes are, thus, far-travelled and sorely tried men of the type of
                    Odysseus and Æneas. Common to both are astonishment at the many and strange
                    adventures of their own lives, and admiration of themselves, who have been
                    protected throughout all these dangers by higher powers. But more significant is
                    another feature which they have in common. Eudore, like Chateaubriand, is the
                    hero who brings about the triumph of Christianity upon earth. Chateaubriand does
                    in the reign of Napoleon what Eudore did in the reign of Galerius; and it is not
                    his fault that he is not a martyr; the thought of martyrdom was one which often
                    occupied him in his youth; he repeatedly said to friends that he would not have
                    drawn back if his life had been required of him. The heroic figure always
                    present to his imagination as a pattern is <pb n="224"/> nothing less than the sacrificial
                    victim who atones for the ungodliness and apostasy of the age, and who by his
                    life-work and his sufferings appeases an angry God. In the first edition of <emph>Les
                    Martyrs</emph> Eudore is plainly called a lesser Christ. In writing of him the author
                    uses the expression that the Almighty demanded »une hostie entière.« In the
                    later editions this particular expression was, on religious grounds, omitted,
                    but in another place the same idea has been inadvertently retained, with an
                    almost comic effect. In the account of Eudore's martyrdom we read: »The chair of
                    fire was now ready. Seated on its glowing bars, the Christian teacher preached
                    the Gospel more eloquently than before. Seraphims shed the dew of heaven on him,
                    and his guardian angel sheltered him with his wings. <emph>Il paraissait dans la
                    flamme comme un pain délicieux préparé pour les tables célestes</emph>.«</p>

                <p>We have here the fundamental idea that distinguishes the type. The first
                    sacrifice, the first saviour, the first »host,« is not enough. Although he is a
                    Christian, Chateaubriand does not believe that the sacrificial death of Christ
                    has been a complete atonement, has done all that was required. To ensure the
                    triumph of religion minor saviours, such as Chateaubriand himself and his hero
                    Eudore, are still needed. In German Romanticism even a miserable creature like
                    Golo in Tieck's <emph>Genoveva</emph> is understood to have a resemblance to Christ; the
                    same is the case with Eudore.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">F. L. Liebenberg, <emph>Bidrag til den Oehlenschlägerske Litteraturs Historie</emph>, i
                        183. Genoveva »sees Christ in him.«</note> Though he errs in his youth and for a short
                    time treads the path of destruction in beautiful Naples (Chateaubriand knew by
                    experience that the best resolutions are no security against such backsliding),
                    he reforms, stands steadfast in every trial, and dies a shining light.</p>

                <p>His love for Velléda is one of these trials.</p>

                <p>Velléda is undoubtedly the most remarkable and most influential female character
                    in the French literature of this period. She is a Gallic maiden of the third
                    century, and in her Chateaubriand depicts the French national type. »This was no
                    ordinary woman. She had that attractive <pb n="225"/> waywardness which distinguishes the
                    women of Gaul. Her glance was quick and keen, the expression of her mouth
                    slightly satirical, her smile peculiarly gentle and expressive. Her bearing was
                    now proud, now voluptuous. Her whole personality was a mixture of gentleness and
                    dignity, of artlessness and art.« But Velléda is not simply French; she bears
                    the distinct impress of the age of her creation; she is an ideal of 1808. She is
                    a priestess, and belongs to the family of the Arch-Druid. In the first decade of
                    the nineteenth century the feminine character was not perfect unless it was
                    marked by religious enthusiasm. It was also obligatory that Velléda should not
                    be purely and simply the child of nature; she is so only to the same extent as
                    were the ladies of 1808. We are expressly and somewhat pedantically told of her
                    that in the family of the Arch-Druid she had been »carefully instructed in the
                    literature of Greece and in the history of her own country.« Velléda is the last
                    priestess of the Druids, as Cymodocée is the last priestess of Homer. A short
                    time ago Corinne had been the model of the ambitious young Frenchwoman, now she
                    was supplanted by Velléda; and, literature not being merely a medium of
                    expression for society, but also an important agent in remoulding it, we see the
                    type pass from the world of imagination into the world of reality. What is
                    Madame de Krüdener, standing in front of the Russian army, but a Christian
                    Velléda?</p>

                <p>When we make the acquaintance of the young priestess she is seated in a boat
                    which is tossing on the waves of a tempestuous sea, trying to still the storm
                    with her incantations; for she, like Fouqué's Undine, has, or believes she has,
                    a certain power over the sea. Later we hear her, in an eloquent speech, calling
                    on her countrymen to take up arms against the Romans and reconquer their
                    liberty. We see her, as the priestess of Teutates, sharpening her sickle to
                    offer a human sacrifice. How beautiful she is as her creator describes her to
                    us–tall and straight, scantily clothed in a short, black, sleeveless tunic, her
                    golden sickle hanging from a girdle of steel! Her eyes are blue, her lips
                    rose-red; her fair flowing hair is bound with a slender oak-branch or a wreath
                    of verbena.</p>

                <p><pb n="226"/> Hardly has she seen Eudore than she loves him. But such simple and natural
                    passion is not enough for the age; it demands that Velléda shall be a devotee of
                    Vesta, shall have taken the oath of eternal virginity. »I am a virgin, the
                    virgin of the island of the Seine; whether I keep my oath or break it I die–die
                    for your sake.« Eudore admires her, but does not love her. His relation to her
                    is that of the pious Æneas to Dido, a fact to which the author makes him draw
                    our attention. The unfortunate Velléda tries all her magic arts. At one time she
                    determines to steal her way in to Eudore on the moonbeams; at another she is
                    preparing to fly into the tower which he inhabits and win his love in the shape
                    of another woman, but the very thought arouses her jealousy and causes her to
                    desist. Eudore, though he does not return her passion, feels himself, as it
                    were, infected by its atmosphere when he is beside her. As a Christian he
                    shrinks with horror from the temptation. »At least twenty times while Velléda
                    was telling me of her sad and tender feelings, I was on the point of throwing
                    myself at her feet, announcing her victory, and making her happy by the
                    acknowledgment of my defeat. At the moment when I was about to succumb, the
                    compassion with which the unhappy woman inspired me saved me. But this very
                    compassion, which saved me at first, in the end proved my destruction; for it
                    deprived me of the last remnant of my strength.« Looking at the matter from the
                    purely artistic point of view, it offends our taste to hear a man dilate thus
                    upon his struggles to preserve his virtue; Eudore's outbursts of shame and
                    remorse do not become him well. »O Cyrille,« he says, »how can I go on with such
                    a story! I blush with shame and confusion.« When at last, after Velléda has
                    attempted to kill herself, this knight of the doleful countenance has yielded
                    and is lying at her feet, nothing less will serve him than to set all the powers
                    of hell loose on the occasion. »I fell at Velléda's feet. ... Hell gave the
                    signal for these terrible nuptials; the spirits of darkness howled from their
                    abyss, the chaste spouses of our forefathers turned away their faces, my
                    guardian angel hid his with his wings and returned to heaven.« <pb n="227"/> Even at the
                    supreme moment this depressing hero is incapable of self-surrender; he is
                    ashamed; he resembles a boy who, with a feeling compounded of gluttony and fear
                    of flogging, devours a stolen apple. »My happiness resembled despair, and any
                    one seeing us in the midst of our rapture would have taken us for two criminals
                    who had just received their sentence of death. From that moment I felt that I
                    was stamped with the seal of divine wrath. Thick darkness spread like a
                    smoke-cloud in my soul; I felt as if a host of rebellious spirits had suddenly
                    taken possession of it. Thoughts filled my mind which until this moment had
                    never occurred to me; the language of hell poured from my lips; I uttered such
                    blasphemies as are heard in the place where there is weeping and gnashing of
                    teeth.«</p>

                <p>It is, thus, on a background of hell-fire that Chateaubriand depicts the love of
                    the Christian confessor and the heathen prophetess. In <emph>Atala</emph>, where we have a
                    kindred representation of combined suffering and pleasure, the insincere
                    anathema against earthly love was not yet launched.</p>

                <p>We come upon much the same idea in one of Alfred de Vigny's youthful works,
                    <emph>Eloa</emph>, a beautiful and notable poem which describes the seduction of a charming
                    young angel of the female sex by the Prince of Darkness. The Satan of <emph>Les
                    Martyrs</emph> was a revolutionist, but De Vigny's Satan is hardly to be distinguished
                    from the Eros of the ancients. Without telling who he is, he ensnares the fair
                    angel with his personal charms and his eloquence, and draws her with him into
                    the abyss. He himself describes his power in the following words:</p>

                </lg></quote></cit>


                <p>We are irresistibly reminded of the song to Eros in the <emph>Antigone</emph> of
                    Sophocles.</p>

                <p><pb n="228"/> As the period is now rapidly descending the incline leading to the conception of
                    Eros as the devil himself, it is only natural that in the descriptions of »real«
                    love on which it prides itself it should be more frigid and impotent, more
                    seraphic and platonic than any other age we are acquainted with. Let us see how
                    the Velléda of the day, Madame de Krüdener herself, describes love in
                    <emph>Valerie</emph>.</p>

                <p>Although <emph>Valerie</emph> is an imitation of <emph>Werther</emph>, it is in many ways extremely
                    unlike <emph>Werther</emph>. It is the story of a young Swede, Gustave Linar by name, who
                    in his childhood learned from his mother »to love virtue,« and who continues to
                    love it until he dies. Along with virtue he loves Valérie, but Valérie is the
                    wife of the Count, his master and ideal, and is herself such a quintessence of
                    all the virtues that he regards her with a reverence which makes desire
                    impossible. Alexander Stakjev confessed his feelings to Krüdener, but Gustave
                    utters not a word to the Count, nor does he ever speak of his sufferings to the
                    woman he loves.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">In two successive editions of his <emph>Französische Litteraturgeschichte</emph>, Julian
                        Schmidt, in giving an account of <emph>Valérie</emph>, has made the mistake of asserting
                        that Gustave confesses to the husband.</note> Preyed upon by uncomprehended and unavowed love, and far too
                    well-behaved to shoot himself, he dies of consumption.</p>

                <p>This is his style: »O my friend, how criminal of me to have yielded to a passion
                    which I was well aware would be my destruction! But I will at least die in the
                    love of virtue and sacred truth; I will not charge Heaven with my misfortunes,
                    as so many men in my plight do (what virtue); I will endure without complaint
                    the suffering which I have brought upon myself, and which I love, although it is
                    killing me. I will go when the Almighty calls me, burdened with many sins, but
                    not with that of suicide.« (ii. 63.)</p>

                <p>Gustave is not a man. It is generally acknowledged that the portraiture of men is
                    not the strong point of female authors. They almost invariably depict them as
                    entirely absorbed in their relations with women. Gustave is, as already
                    observed, a Scandinavian; but Scandinavians have <pb n="229"/> no reason to be proud of this
                    compatriot, in whom the vigour of the Northerner is conspicuously absent. The
                    national colouring of the story is confined almost entirely to the Teutonic
                    sentimentality in which the descriptions are immersed, and to a variety of
                    Swedish names, which, it goes without saying, are as a rule incorrectly spelt.
                    At Venice Gustave gives a fête in Valerie's honour; the decorations are intended
                    to remind her of the home of her youth, amongst the birches and pines; when she
                    catches sight of them she cries: »Ah! c'est Dronnigor« (Drottninggård).</p>

                <p>There is nothing characteristically Swedish about Gustave. Really beautiful in
                    the description of his character is the gleam of youthful philanthropic
                    enthusiasm shed over his confessions. It seems to him that in most men's lives
                    the period of love is succeeded by that of ambition. There is something fine and
                    sincere in the language in which he tells that the glory others desire is not
                    that which in his eyes has seemed desirable. »The glory of which I dreamed was
                    won by occupying one's self with the happiness of all, as love occupies itself
                    with the happiness of a single individual. It was virtue in the man who
                    possessed it, before his fellow-men gave it the name of fame.« And he adds:
                    »What has real glory in common with the petty vanity of the many, with the
                    pitiful contention that one is something because one is striving hard to be it?«
                    It is strange to find sentiments like these in a book the fame of which was due
                    to such artifices as were employed to puff <emph>Valérie</emph>.</p>

                <p>The heroine is equipped with all the charms which a lady as passionately in love
                    with herself as Madame de Krüdener was could communicate to her own portrait.
                    She is a thorough woman, whilst the unfortunate Gustave, though quite aware of
                    the foolishness and hopelessness of his passion, is absolutely unable to burst
                    his bonds and begin to live the life of a man. He is obliged to content himself
                    with such humble expressions of his adoration as kissing a child whom his
                    mistress has kissed on the spot which her lips have touched, or kissing the
                    outside of the window-pane on the inside of which she is resting her bare arm
                    during the pause between two dances at a ball, or <pb n="230"/> pressing her hand and feeling
                    the ring given her by her husband, or fainting in her presence, so that she is
                    obliged to bathe his brow with eau-de-Cologne.</p>

                <p>A faint perfume of eau-de-Cologne may be said to pervade the whole story. It is
                    significant that the first service which Valérie asks Gustave to do her after
                    they have become intimate is to procure her secretly a little rouge, which her
                    husband objects to her using. With the odour of eau-de-Cologne is blended an
                    odour of propriety and veneration which is so powerful that it is almost
                    obnoxious, and a supernaturalness in the matter of the affections which is both
                    silly and unbeautiful. Valérie is <emph>enceinte</emph> when Gustave conceives his passion
                    for her, but this circumstance has no curative effect on him, though he lives in
                    intimate companionship with her until her son is born. They wax enthusiastic
                    together over Ossian and Clarissa Harlowe. Gustave never feels the slightest
                    jealousy of the Count, nor does the Count of him. It is with the Count's hand in
                    his that Gustave dies. Love is, in short, so purified, so unnaturally seraphic,
                    that with its passion it has also lost its poetry. This is doubly significant
                    when we happen to know how little seraphic was the life with which this poetess
                    of love had prepared herself to write her novel, and how cleverly she herself
                    managed to reconcile the sacred with the more carnal aspects of love.</p>

                <p>Lamartine and his Elvire are the last couple on whose relations we have time to
                    dwell.</p>

                <p>Lamartine's youthful poems treated of love, but of a love so pure that it was
                    called »une prière à deux.« It was depicted with the transfiguring ideality
                    which is the result of the death of the beloved one. The poet presses to his
                    lips the crucifix which she kissed before she died, and the poem <emph>Le Crucifix</emph>
                    is so soulful that we believe Lamartine when he tells us in a note appended to
                    it: »I never re-read these verses.« In his novel, <emph>Raphael</emph>, a much later work,
                    he gives us the real facts of the same love story, and these throw a new light
                    on the famous poems.</p>

                <p>Julie, to give the lady known by the name of Elvire her real name, is a créole,
                    aged twenty-eight. She is an orphan, <pb n="231"/> and has married a man of seventy, a famous
                    scientist, that she may have a protector; but her actual relation to him has
                    never been anything but that of a daughter to a father. She has an affection of
                    the heart which may at any time prove fatal. By the Lake of Bourget in Savoy
                    (the lake of which Lamartine has sung so beautifully), where she is spending the
                    autumn for the sake of her health, she meets Raphael, the young hero of the
                    book, a man differing in nothing but name from its author, who in its pages
                    gives us not only real facts, but even calls his friends and acquaintances by
                    their real names. He describes himself as he was then–twenty-four years old,
                    young and poor, solitary and shy, tender-hearted and given to enthusiasms,
                    already a little <emph>blasé</emph> from much dissipation, tired of all the commonplace and
                    dissolute amours in which he had hitherto indulged.</p>

                <p>It cannot be said that Lamartine gave an altogether too unfavourable description
                    of himself. The delicacy and refinement of Raphael's feelings was such that his
                    comrades used laughingly to declare that he was home-sick for heaven. In a
                    somewhat clumsy manner Lamartine attempts to give us an idea of this refinement:
                    »If he had wielded the brush, he would have painted the Madonna of Foligno; if
                    the chisel, he would have sculptured Canova's Psyche. If he had been a poet, he
                    would have written the lamentations of Job, Tasso's Herminia stanzas,
                    Shakespeare's moonlight scene in <emph>Romeo and Juliet</emph>, and Lord Byron's
                    description of Haydee.« Fortunately it was not required of him to do any of
                    these things, as they had been done by others. We know that in his efforts at a
                    later period in one of the three directions, namely, as a poet, he did not
                    attain to the level of the masters named.</p>

                <p>In <emph>Raphael</emph> we have a masterly description of a young man's ardent love, a love
                    which, though it has taken possession of him heart and soul, is of an almost
                    altogether spiritual nature, partly because its object inspires such a degree of
                    reverence and compassion that the senses are not allowed to come into play,
                    partly because the young man, after leading a loose life with women for whom he
                    has felt no respect, shudders at the very idea of his relation <pb n="232"/> to this woman,
                    whom he reveres, becoming one of the same nature with his past amours.</p>

                <p>He has had love affairs, but he has never been truly in love before. It seems to
                    him as if, when she looks at him, there is a remoteness in her gaze which he has
                    never felt before in human eye. It reminds him of the gleam of the stars, which
                    has traversed millions of miles of space. He has a hesitation in approaching her
                    which makes the distance between them seem impassable. When he at last succeeds
                    in making her acquaintance, it is the name and the position of a brother which
                    she gives him, and with this he is contented and happy. No sooner have they
                    found one another than he feels as if he were relieved from a heavy burden–the
                    burden of his heart. As soon as he gives it away he learns what life in all its
                    fulness is. He feels as if he were floating in the purest ether; his joy is
                    infinite and luminous as the air of heaven. During the first hours which he
                    spends with her he loses all perception of time; he is certain that a thousand
                    years spent thus would to him be so many seconds. He does not feel like a human
                    being, but like a living hymn of praise.</p>

                <p>And this ecstatic mood lasts as long as he breathes the same air with her. They
                    are happy together during the beautiful summer days, and prolong their summer
                    into autumn: »Our summer was in ourselves.«</p>

                <p>We feel that this description of the bliss of young love is a description of
                    something that really has existed. The young couple are living not far from the
                    place where Rousseau, as a youth, loved Madame de Warens. Raphael is rather
                    younger than Julie–he is twenty-four, she twenty-eight; this gives their
                    relation a certain resemblance to that between Rousseau and his protectress; but
                    the emotions of Raphael and Julie are as incorporeal and romantic as those of
                    the other couple were substantially human.</p>

                <p>And not only the happiness produced by the presence of the loved one, but the
                    pain of separation, the longing for letters, the fever of expectation when the
                    time of meeting draws near, and the agonies of parting are described, with many
                    admirable realistic touches, in a manner worthy of a great writer.</p>

                <p><pb n="233"/> Raphael lives in the country, Julie in Paris. When he takes a walk, his steps
                    involuntarily turn towards the north, to diminish the distance which separates
                    him from her. His day contains only one happy hour, that which brings the
                    postman with her letter. As soon as he hears the postman's step he is at the
                    window; he meets him at the street door, hides the letter in his pocket, and
                    hastens with trembling knees to his room, where he locks himself in to read it
                    in privacy. Later in the story, when Raphael is in Paris, we have the admirable
                    description of his wanderings on the winter evenings back and forwards across
                    one of the Seine bridges, waiting for the moment when the lamp in her window
                    shall show him that her guests have taken their departure, and that he is
                    certain to find her alone. Note the blind beggar on the bridge, into whose tin
                    cup he never forgets to throw his mite; the striking of the hour and the
                    half-hour by the church clocks; and another delicate little touch–Raphael's
                    hearing gradually becomes so acute that he distinguishes the separate chime of
                    each clock in the chorus.</p>

                <p>All this is excellent. Unfortunately the novel as a whole is spoiled by its
                    religious purpose.</p>

                <p>The authors of this period could not write of love pure and simple; they felt
                    obliged to mix religion up with it. Lamartine makes his lovers go through whole
                    courses of philosophy and theology together. They hold different opinions, and
                    she is intellectually his superior. He still retains the beliefs of his
                    childhood. In the house of her famous husband she has associated with
                    intellectually emancipated men of science, whose opinions, marked with the stamp
                    of the eighteenth century, she has imbibed. He and she really belong to
                    different generations–she to the generation of the empire, he to that of the
                    monarchy. Faust, when he is catechised by his Gretchen, is obliged to parry her
                    attempt to convert him by explaining his unbelief to her in palliating
                    euphemisms; the opposite happens here; Raphael makes long, fruitless attempts to
                    convert his Julie to faith in God and Christianity. The first time the innocent
                    youth recommends her to seek aid from God, he is astonished when, instead of
                    answering him, she <pb n="234"/> looks sad and indifferent and turns away her face. He timidly
                    asks her reason for so doing. She answers: »That word distresses me.« »What! the
                    word which signifies life, love, and everything that is good–how can it
                    distress the most perfect of God's creatures?« &amp;c., &amp;c. Then she is
                    obliged to explain to him that what he calls <emph>God</emph> is what she calls <emph>law</emph>–an
                    infinite greatness, an absolute, inevitable necessity, something that it is
                    impossible to move with prayers.</p>

                <p>To this conviction of hers is due Julie's easy and yet dignified moral attitude.
                    She says: »I was educated by a philosopher, and in my husband's house I have
                    lived in the society of free-thinking men, who have severed themselves entirely
                    from the dogmas and observances of a church which they have helped to undermine;
                    hence I have no superstitions and none of the weak-minded scruples which impel
                    most women to bow their heads under a second yoke, superadded to that which our
                    consciences impose upon us.«</p>

                <p>It is Raphael who plays the girl's part when, time after time, he supplicates a
                    woman of a spirit like this to return to the bosom of the Roman Catholic Church.
                    »I besought her to seek in a religion of love and tenderness, in the sacred
                    gloom of our churches, in the mysterious faith in that Christ who is the God of
                    tears, in genuflections and prayer, the relief and the comfort which I myself
                    had found in them in my youth.« Raphael's attempt at conversion was not entirely
                    successful; he himself was satisfied with the result, but a more strictly
                    orthodox Christian would hardly have been so.</p>

                <p>It is love, we are led to understand, which teaches Julie to believe in God.
                    »There is a God,« she said; »there is an infinite love, of which ours is only
                    one drop, a drop which falls back into the divine ocean from which we have drawn
                    it. This ocean is God. At this moment I feel, I see, I understand Him by means
                    of my happiness.... Yes,« she continued, with even more ardour in her glance and
                    voice, »let the perishable names by which we have called the attraction which
                    draws us to one another be forgotten. <pb n="235"/> There is only one name which expresses
                    it–that is God. He has revealed Himself to me in your eyes. God, God, God!« she
                    called, as if teaching herself a new language; »God is you; God is what I am to
                    you. We are God.«</p>

                <p>All this impresses us as having more purpose in it than truth to nature. Not such
                    is the eloquence of happy love.</p>

                <p>Had Julie's husband, the old philosopher, happened to overhear these effusions,
                    he could have told the lovers that such doctrines and such emotions, far from
                    being Christian, are pure pantheism. We cannot doubt that he would have done so
                    with perfect calmness, for he does not feel the slightest jealousy. He knows
                    that Julie and Raphael write to each other every day, and he also knows the
                    ethereal nature of their love. When Raphael comes to Paris, all he says to him
                    is: »Remember that you have not one friend but two in this house. Julie could
                    not make a better choice of a brother, nor I of a son.« It is comical that
                    Raphael, for his part, should feel no disquietude concerning the old man, unless
                    we reckon as such a feeling of regret that he is drawing near to the grave
                    without any belief in immortality; and it is characteristic of the period that
                    even the aged scientist is in the end converted.</p>

                <p>The old man has, in a manner, no ground for jealousy. Lamartine has very naïvely
                    introduced into his novel a piece of realism, which, while it explains many
                    things, weakens the edifying effect which he aimed at producing. Julie's reply
                    to Raphael's first confession of love decides once and for all the nature of
                    their mutual relations. She says: »I believe only in an invisible God, who has
                    imprinted His image upon nature, His law upon our instincts, and His morality
                    upon our reason. Reason, feeling, and conscience are the only revelations I
                    acknowledge. None of these three oracles of my life would forbid me to belong to
                    you; my whole soul would prostrate itself at your feet, if this could purchase
                    your happiness. But are we not more certain of the spirituality and eternity of
                    our love when it remains on the heights of pure thought, in regions inaccessible
                    to change and death, than when it degrades and profanes itself by descending to
                    the base regions of sensuality?«</p>

                <p><pb n="236"/> It is, we observe, the love that despises the senses which Julie somewhat
                    affectedly extols. Now, certain as it is that love can continue to exist even
                    when circumstances forbid its complete gratification, it is equally certain that
                    renunciation for the sake of renunciation and of spirituality is contrary to
                    nature. When the religious reaction set in in Denmark, Ingemann, in his youthful
                    works, preached such renunciation. The question whether Julie really favoured
                    the principle, or whether we are not in reality indebted for it to Lamartine,
                    who admired without practising it, must be left undecided. In his reminiscences
                    of his love affairs, Lamartine is in the habit of describing himself as
                    emancipated from all sensual desire. And we know them all, these love affairs;
                    for the man who, according to his own account, had always such complete control
                    over his passions, had very little control over his pen. We know (from his
                    <emph>Confidences</emph>) how during his meetings with Lucy, the beautiful girl of sixteen,
                    in the cold frosty weather, he was as cold as the winter night. We remember the
                    sentence in <emph>Graziella</emph>: »We slept two steps from each other; my cold
                    indifference protected me.« It may be doubtful whether it was really Julie who
                    enounced the principle of renunciation, but there can be no doubt of the
                    genuineness of the next speech attributed to her. She adds, blushing deeply,
                    that the renunciation she demands of him is imperative–on account of her
                    health; she has medical authority for what she says; she would leave his arms
                    like a shadow, like a corpse: »The sacrifice would be the sacrifice not only of
                    my dignity, but of my life.«</p>

                <p>It is impossible to deny that there is an extraordinary inconsistency between
                    this last utterance and those which precede it, and that this exceedingly
                    practical explanation deprives the spiritual friendship of much of its
                    spirituality. We seem to come down from the seventh heaven and feel the solid
                    earth beneath our feet again.</p>

                <p>There follow scenes like those in <emph>Valérie</emph>–projects of suicide which are never
                    carried into execution; nights spent by the lovers in tender converse, with a
                    thick oaken door between them; rapt, sentimental ecstasies. This is a love <pb n="237"/> which
                    finds expression only in lingering looks, languishing that reaches the verge of
                    insanity, sighs that are almost screams, long silences and endless
                    outpourings–never a caress or an embrace. Unpleasant, almost offensive, in any
                    case unnatural, is the manner in which, in this love-story too, our attention is
                    perpetually drawn to the fact that the lovers keep their vow, that their love
                    remains platonic. On the one solitary occasion when there seems to be real
                    danger, there arrives at the critical moment–who? None other than that
                    estimable old man, Monsieur Bonald, with whose theories on the subject of woman
                    and of marriage we are acquainted. He is coming to stay with Julie, arrives at
                    twelve o'clock at night, and is thus saved the grief of seeing his pupils rebel
                    against order. Even in his novel, Lamartine does not miss the opportunity of
                    proclaiming that he was at variance with Bonald, especially as regarded his
                    doctrine of theocratic government. It became the fashion to disagree with
                    Bonald. Chateaubriand himself remarks in his <emph>Memoirs</emph> (iv. 23): »Monsieur de
                    Bonald was a clever man. His sagacity was mistaken for genius.«</p>

                <p>Whenever Julie pities Raphael, he answers her with pious outbursts in which he
                    compares her and himself to Abélard and Héloïse. »Have I ever let you feel that
                    I desire ought else than to share this suffering with you? Does it not make both
                    of us voluntary and pure victims? Is not this the eternal burnt-offering of
                    love, which has perhaps not been offered before the eyes of the angels since the
                    days of Héloïse until now?«</p>

                <p>When, after studying <emph>Raphael</emph>, we re-read Lamartine's poems to Elvire, we have a
                    new key to the understanding of the idealism and vagueness of this poetic love,
                    which, obliged to renounce sensual pleasures, pretends that the corporeal world
                    does not exist for it. A distinction must, however, be drawn between the later
                    poems and some written much earlier and in a perfectly different tone, a tone
                    which recalls the eighteenth century. Take as examples the poems <emph>À Elvire</emph>
                    (which is in reality addressed to <emph>Graziella</emph>) and <emph>Sapho</emph>.</p>

                <p>We have now enough of examples; let us consider to <pb n="238"/> what conclusion they have led
                    us. Choosing a simple emotion, but one of those which every school of literature
                    sets itself to express and interpret, and which each expresses and interprets in
                    a characteristic manner, we have examined a number of different specimens of the
                    manner in which it is interpreted by this particular school. Here, as in all the
                    other domains of literature which we have inspected, we have found the natural
                    side of life ignored, or concealed, or blackened, or represented as something to
                    be ashamed of. Chateaubriand and Madame de Krüdener seek out cases in which love
                    is considered to be criminal and sinful, and either describe the triumphant
                    yells of the powers of hell when the hero succumbs or the jubilations of the
                    principalities and powers when the infamy is not perpetrated. We have the same
                    paraphernalia in Alfred de Vigny's writings:</p>

                <p>De Vigny makes Satan speak like Eros, that is to say, Eros like Satan. Lamartine
                    enthrones love in his poetry as seraphic, as emancipated from all earthly
                    passion, but in <emph>Raphael</emph> describes it as what it really was, ethereal against
                    its will–which, however, only adds to the merit of the lovers and provides
                    angels and burnt-offerings, these latter of a sweet savour unknown since the
                    days of poor Abélard.</p>

                <p>And below everything there is an under-current of hypocrisy. Eudore, who would
                    have us believe that he is made utterly miserable by Velléda's passion, is
                    nevertheless secretly flattered by her having cut her white throat for his sake.
                    He bewails his fall in expressions which convey the idea that he feels tempted
                    to fall again. The authoress of <emph>Valerie</emph> proclaims the moral purity of her
                    heroine in the market-place and clamours of chastity and renunciation in all the
                    newspapers at a time when she herself is peculiarly unfit to be a teacher of
                    morality. Lamartine, as novelist, naïvely gives an explanation of his relations <pb n="239"/> with Elvire which differs entirely from the impression of them that the public
                    had naturally gathered from the ethereal ecstasies of <emph>Les Méditations</emph>, and
                    ends by smothering the real beauties of his literary art in languid, lachrymose
                    sentimentality.</p>

                <p>In the representation of love, as in everything else, men aimed at
                    supernaturalness, and only succeeded in either crippling or hypocritically
                    ignoring nature.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Sources: Lamartine, <emph>Graziella; Raphael; Les Confidences; Mémoires</emph>; Madame

                <head><pb n="[240]"/> XI. DISSOLUTION OF THE THEORETICAL PRINCIPLE OF AUTHORITY</head>

                <p>In the lyric poetry of Lamartine and Victor Hugo, as in the prose of
                    Chateaubriand, there was, in spite of the unconditioned assertion of the
                    principle of authority, a hidden or germinating antagonism to that principle in
                    <emph>literature</emph>, as demanding unqualified reverence for the past, its writers, and
                    its forms.</p>

                <p>It has already been remarked that the great political and social revolution in
                    France did not affect literary <emph>form</emph>. As regarded this, there was no necessity
                    to re-establish the principle of authority; it had never been overthrown. In no
                    domain are the French less revolutionary than in that of literature. The Academy
                    is the one institution of the country which has held its ground since the days
                    of Richelieu, and to-day it has the same name, the same aims, and even the same
                    number of members that it had then. In literature the principle of authority was
                    known by the name of the classic spirit, and the Revolution, far from weakening
                    the classic spirit, had strengthened it. The Revolution itself is a classic
                    French tragedy. Like all other French tragedies, it clothes its heroes in Greek
                    and Roman garb. In their style and language they imitate the republicans of
                    ancient Rome, and it is significant that it is the most cultivated and literary
                    revolutionary party, the Girondists, who adopt the antique »thou« and the
                    antique designation of »citizen.« The Jacobins are the direct descendants of
                    Corneille–the same toga style of oratory, the same love of magnificent
                    laconicism. With the same enthusiasm with which Cromwell's soldiers
                    metamorphosed themselves into ancient Hebrews, adopting their names and singing
                    their psalms, the Frenchmen of the Revolution metamorphosed themselves into
                    ancient Romans; <pb n="241"/> and when David, the Jacobin and intimate friend of Robespierre,
                    left his seat in the Legislative Assembly to paint the Horatii or the Brutus
                    exhibited in 1791, he simply took his associates as models; as painter he did
                    not need to go a step beyond the boundaries of his own period.</p>

                <p>Just as French tragedy, when it came into being, had refused to build upon the
                    foundation of the history of its own country, had turned its back on French
                    tradition and laid its scenes in far-away Rome in the far-off, dimly discerned
                    past, now the Revolution, heedless of history, heedless of the France of its own
                    day, took far-off, un-historically appreciated antiquity, with its republicans,
                    evolved under such different conditions, as the model to be exactly imitated.
                    The modern Gracchi and Horatii imitated the ancient. There is, as has often been
                    remarked, a Roman loftiness of style in Madame Roland's letters to Buzot. The
                    ladies of the Directory at times took Cornelia, and more frequently Aspasia, as
                    their model, even in dress. In the language of some of Napoleon's earliest
                    letters to Josephine the influence of Latin models is to be traced; and even
                    when he no longer stands in need of a model, his style is as classic as his
                    profile. His taste in literature was also classic; his attachment to »les
                    règles« and his admiration of Corneille are matter of history. As long as he is
                    the ruler of France, even those authors who make an attempt at a species of
                    opposition, such as Raynouard, keep in the classic track. A comparison of
                    Werner's <emph>Söhne des Thals</emph> (Sons of the Vale) with Raynouard's <emph>Les Templiers</emph>
                    will show how differently the same subject can be approached. The German poet is
                    as mysterious and incomprehensible, as extravagant and fantastic in his
                    treatment of the theme as the Frenchman with his obligatory alexandrines, his
                    king and his queen, his five acts and his three unities, is well-regulated and
                    law-abiding. Raynouard's play represents a sort of lawsuit between church and
                    state; the king conducts his case in a most orderly manner; the Knights Templar
                    conduct theirs in an equally orderly manner, and are thereupon burnt in an
                    orderly manner–orderly, for we see as little as possible of the execution and <pb n="242"/> of what precedes it; we only hear of it all in one of those long concluding
                    narrations which were in vogue as far back as the days of Euripides. And the
                    metre is still the metre prescribed by Boileau, that father of evil. The meaning
                    of the clause, which is cut in two by the cæsura, ends with the line, and the
                    lines are as like each other as one penny bun is like another penny bun. There
                    is neither harmony, nor animation, nor rhythm, nor rhyme in them, for <emph>larmes</emph>
                    and <emph>armes, époux</emph> and <emph>coups, souffrir</emph> and <emph>mourir</emph> can hardly be called
                    rhymes. They resemble molluscs, these lines; and one of the features they have
                    in common with molluscs is, that it is possible to cut them in two without their
                    showing any less sign of life because of it.</p>

                <p>One consequence of this retention of the classic spirit is the exact resemblance
                    between the style of some of the most eminent prose authors of this day and the
                    style of their abhorred opponents, the philosophers of the eighteenth century.
                    We have the most conspicuous instance of this in Joseph de Maistre. De Maistre's
                    inability to comprehend history, his want of the critical faculty and of any
                    deep religious feeling, his tendency to systematise, his argumentativeness,
                    which tempted him to draw hard and fast conclusions–all this in combination,
                    really deriving from the eighteenth century, found expression in the style of
                    that century. Bonalds cold, argumentative style, his craze for reducing
                    everything to formulas, his persuasion that he makes his positions
                    mathematically obvious, show that he too is a child of the century which
                    produced Condillac, and his work a product of the very spirit which he combated.
                    The only difference is, that such a man as Condillac is as clear and consistent
                    as Bonald is changeable and self-contradictory.</p>

                <p>A distinguishing feature in both classic prose and poetry is <emph>the domination of
                    reason</emph>. It is against this ruler that literature makes its first revolt in
                    Madame de Staël's emotional style and Chateaubriand's richly coloured prose.
                    Emotion and colour–these are the two great exiles who now return from a long
                    banishment. And, curiously enough, it is not <pb n="243"/> only his talents but his art
                    theories which make of Chateaubriand a rebel against the principle of authority
                    in literature, the very principle which it was his aim by means of literature to
                    uphold. For classical poetry from its earliest days had sought its subjects and
                    its inspiration in heathen antiquity and heathen mythology, and he was calling
                    upon his fellow authors to open their own and their countrymen's eyes and ears
                    to a poetry diametrically opposed to this, namely, the poetry of
                    Christianity–was, in other words, <emph>attacking literary tradition as the champion
                    of Christian tradition</emph>. His artistic principles show him to be of the new age,
                    his political and social principles mark him as the man of the past; he is
                    two-faced; he gives poetical expression to all the modern emotions, wearing a
                    mask of unchangeable reverence for all the official authorities of the past. It
                    is more especially his style which makes of him a Romanticist before the days of
                    Romanticism. Hence, when first Lamartine and then Hugo follow his example,
                    forsake heathen, and seek their themes in Christian mythology, society is for a
                    time at a loss to know whether it is to recognise a conservative or a
                    revolutionary spirit in these attempts to uphold the sacredness of religion in
                    new ways. But by degrees the germ of revolt against the principle of authority
                    latent in the new literary standpoint develops to such an extent that the
                    countenance of the new school is changed.</p>

                <p>It is interesting to trace the stages of this development in Victor Hugo's
                    different prefaces to his <emph>Odes</emph>. In the first (of 1822), which consists of only
                    a few lines, the young poet asserts that loyalty and Christian faith are the
                    standards of true poetry. The nineteenth century, he declares, has first
                    revealed to the world the truth that poetry <emph>does not depend upon the form given
                    to ideas, but upon the ideas themselves</emph>. In his preface to the second edition
                    (published the same year) he further observes that the poet's task now is to
                    substitute for the faded, false colours of the heathen mythology those new and
                    true ones which belong to the Christian conception of the origin of the
                    universe. The ode ought now to speak the severe, the consolatory, the pious
                    language of which an old society, quitting with trembling <pb n="244"/> steps »the revels of
                    atheism and anarchy« stands in such need.</p>

                <p>He earnestly hopes that his readers will not think that he is so conceited as »to
                    wish to strike out a new path or create a new literary style.« In the preface of
                    1824 the same assurances are repeated, in very characteristic words; but we feel
                    that the young poet is now the object of suspiciously observant criticism, and
                    that the name »Romanticist,« as synonymous with transgressor of the laws of
                    classic art, is one which men will be very apt to apply to him. He is eager to
                    prove his literary orthodoxy. What is needed, he says, is not novelty, but
                    truth. It is this need which he aims at supplying. Taste, »which is neither more
                    nor less than <emph>authority</emph> in literature,« shows him that works which are true as
                    regards their matter ought also to be true as regards their style. This leads to
                    the demand for »local colouring,« a demand which the classic authors can hardly
                    be said to have supplied. But it is an understood matter that the laws imposed
                    upon the language by Boileau are to be <emph>religiously</emph> observed. Of him Hugo
                    writes: »Boileau shares with Racine the unique merit of having given its
                    permanent form to the French language; this in itself is a sufficient proof that
                    he too possessed <emph>creative genius</emph>!« Boileau a creative genius! With what
                    derisive laughter will Victor Hugo, ere many years have passed, receive such an
                    assertion!</p>

                <p>Of the poet Hugo writes that it is his duty to lead the vanguard of the people
                    like a pillar of fire, lead them back to the great principles of <emph>order</emph>,
                    morality, and honour. The flaw in the literature of the century of Louis »the
                    Great« is that its authors invoke the gods of heathendom instead of the God of
                    Christianity. If in this matter, Hugo naïvely remarks, they had acted
                    differently, the »triumph of the sophistical writings« of the eighteenth century
                    would have been much impeded. What might not have been the fate of »philosophy,«
                    if the cause of God had been championed by genius instead of by virtue
                    alone!</p>

                <p>He vigorously objects to being called romantic. He affirms that he »has not the
                    slightest idea of what is meant by classic and romantic literature.« Refusing to
                    be in<pb n="245"/>fluenced by all the nonsense written on the subject at that time, he in the
                    following sensible utterance declares the distinction to be an empty and
                    meaningless one: »It is an acknowledged fact that every literature receives an
                    impression, in some cases strong, in some weak, from the climate, customs, and
                    history of the nation of which it is the expression. David, Homer, Virgil,
                    Tasso, Milton, Corneille, men each one of whom represents a literature and a
                    nation, have nothing in common but genius.« It is impossible, therefore, to
                    divide them into classical and romantic poets. He combats the assertion that the
                    literary revival (evidently referring to Chateaubriand) is an outcome of the
                    political revolution. »The literature of to-day may to a certain extent be the
                    result of the Revolution, without on that account being its expression.
                    Revolutionary society had its literature, <emph>ugly and foolish as itself</emph>. That
                    society and that literature are dead and will never come to life again. <emph>Order</emph>
                    has revived in all the institutions of society; it is also reviving in
                    literature.... Just as the Revolution originated in literature, so the
                    literature of our day is <emph>the anticipatory expression of the pious and loyal
                    society</emph> which will most certainly arise from those ruins.«</p>

                <p>Hugo was mistaken; the literature in question was the exact expression of the
                    intellectual mood of its day, and the attempts at reform which aroused such
                    anxiety were really forerunners of a literary revolution. For they destroyed
                    faith in authority as authority–in this particular case faith in Boileau. From
                    the moment when it was discovered that there were spots even in this sun, it was
                    not possible to confine doubt to the few points where it had first modestly and
                    cautiously insinuated itself. Literary tradition was a principle; it had to be
                    either accepted or rejected.</p>

                <p>In reading Hugo's second last preface to the <emph>Odes</emph> (1826) we feel that his
                    thoughts, always turning upon <emph>order</emph>, that favourite idea of the day, are about
                    to drive him from the shore of literature out on to the open sea. He has
                    discovered that order is in reality something different from the regularity
                    which is attained by discipline and <pb n="246"/> coercion. Employing a simile which occurred
                    naturally to a youth brought up in the neighbourhood of Versailles, with
                    Chateaubriand's descriptions of the luxuriant landscape of North America as his
                    leisure reading, he compares the gardens of Versailles and their carefully
                    clipped, symmetrically trimmed trees with a forest in the New World, and
                    exclaims: »We will not ask, Where here is splendour, where grandeur, or beauty?
                    but simply, Where is <emph>order</emph> and where <emph>disorder?</emph>« He recognises now that
                    regularity concerns only the outward form of things, but that order lies at
                    their very foundation, and is a result of the skilful arrangement of their
                    elements. »A writer is not classic,« he says, »because he <emph>slavishly</emph> treads in
                    the footprints which others have left on the road.«</p>

                <p>We have thus followed Hugo step by step along the path which leads him towards
                    the final breach with the literary principle of authority. One year more, and he
                    throws off the yoke, assumes the leadership of the Romantic School in France,
                    and in its first manifesto, the preface to <emph>Cromwell</emph> (October, 1827), declares
                    that there is a tyranny of the past in literature exactly as there is in
                    politics, and that this tyranny lies like a nightmare on the breast of the young
                    generation: »The train of the eighteenth century still stretches into ours, but
                    should not we young men who have seen Bonaparte be too proud to bear such a
                    train?« Observe that he now, in direct antagonism to the spirit of the
                    Restoration, invokes Napoleon as a species of liberator. And he writes of »that
                    rouged, powdered and patched poetry, that literature of hoops and furbelows.« He
                    is aiming his first blow at Boileau.</p>

                <p>New as Lamartine had seemed, both in style and matter, he had retained many of
                    the classic circumlocutions. In spite of his aversion to the lyre, he often
                    named it in his poetry, and in choosing his subjects he preferred the abstract
                    to the concrete.</p>

                <p>Victor Hugo was as yet almost equally cautious. »Granted that it is advantageous
                    and at times necessary,« he writes, »to renew a few worn-out expressions, to
                    replace a few old phrases, and perhaps even to endeavour to <pb n="247"/> improve our verse by
                    increasing the sonority of its metre and the purity of its rhyme, it cannot be
                    too often repeated that this must be the limit of all attempts at perfecting it.
                    Every reform at variance with the natural accent and genius of our mother-tongue
                    must be regarded as an attack on the first principles of taste.«</p>

                <p>Neither alteration of the rhythm, nor variability in the position of the cæsura,
                    nor the continuation of the phrase from one line to another (changes all of
                    which he afterwards vindicated), does he as yet consider permissible. In the
                    <emph>Odes</emph> he conforms to the old poetic court fashion (he does not, for instance,
                    say <emph>Convention</emph>, but <emph>Senate</emph>, does not say <emph>shawl</emph>, but <emph>drapery</emph> or <emph>treasure
                    of Kashmir</emph>), only making a few cautious attempts at a change of metre, with the
                    object of rendering the ode style less stiff and heavy.</p>

                <p>That court fashion was of the following nature. A small collection had been made
                    of refined expressions, of choice words–the elect, as it were, of
                    language–which alone had admission into poetry. Poets did not say sword, but
                    brand, did not say soldier, but warrior, and they never mentioned such things as
                    guns or knives; just as Danish poetry for long acknowledged only roses, lilies,
                    violets, woodruff, and at the outside a dozen other flowers as representatives
                    of the whole floral world. The consequence of this was that the supply of words
                    was extremely limited, that there were only a few hundred pairs of noble rhymes,
                    and that the same expressions, which had to be constantly repeated, brought with
                    them exactly the same thoughts and feelings. The poetic oratory of those days
                    was very much on a par with the pulpit oratory of our own. Sublime was the
                    adjective applied to the dignified flow of words in which things were spoken of
                    as far as possible without ever calling them by their real names–and, be it
                    observed, only things that reminded men as little as possible of their earthly
                    nature, of the material side of their being. One result of this was that the
                    direct, unambiguous mention of common things in any work which laid claim to the
                    privilege of classic style at once produced a comic effect. When Lebrun's <emph>Cid</emph>
                    was acted, the word <emph>chambre</emph> called forth a murmur of dis<pb n="248"/>approval. It also
                    explains how the attempt made about the time of the earliest experiments in the
                    Romantic style to introduce Shakespeare into France created such consternation.
                    Every one knows that <emph>Othello</emph>, acted in the translation of Alfred de Vigny at
                    the Odéon–that is to say to an audience of students, the least prejudiced and
                    least prudish of Parisian audiences–was hissed because of the occurrence in it
                    of the word »pocket-handkerchief.«</p>

                <p>Count Alfred de Vigny, who was born in 1797, belonged to a family of ancient
                    lineage, and was brought up a loyal adherent of monarchy by the grace of God. In
                    1814 he received a lieutenant's commission in the army of Louis XVIII, and he
                    quickly developed into one of the most attractive and most independent literary
                    characters of the day. In several branches of literature it was he who took the
                    first step in the new direction, Hugo who followed. He wrote a historical novel
                    in the style of Sir Walter Scott before Hugo did (<emph>Cinq-Mars</emph>, 1826), had a play
                    acted before Hugo (the rhymed translation of <emph>Othello</emph>, 1829), the style of
                    which created a great sensation, and he forestalled Hugo in introducing freedom
                    and flexibility into lyric poetry. He was the Columbus of the new movement, Hugo
                    the Amerigo Vespucci who gave the newly discovered continent its name.</p>

                <p>It is not a matter for surprise that, at a time when authority was upheld on
                    every side, Hugo should have begun by accommodating himself to existing literary
                    rules, nay, by actually believing in them as real laws of poetry and language.
                    But presently he commenced to experiment with them a little, to shake them a
                    little, to doubt them a little, to interpret them in his own way, doing it all
                    with the profoundest reverence, until it became no longer possible for him to
                    observe them, upon which he overthrew them. In one of his poems (<emph>Les
                    Contemplations</emph>, i., vii.) he gives a witty description of the revolution which
                    he ended by making:</p>

                <p>But Hugo, even when he doubts, has not yet reached this stage. He still styles
                    his poetry »cavalier« poetry, stamping himself by a word which recalls the
                    restoration of royalty in England as the poet of the restoration of royalty in
                    France. The rock on which he splits is the impossibility of harmonising
                    religious and literary tradition. This is especially felt in the ballads. Hugo
                    revives memories of the Middle Ages and feudalism. What could be more royalist?
                    But the literature of the age of Louis XIV. had <pb n="250"/> utterly rejected the Middle Ages
                    and their memories–so what could be less classical? One of the ballads (<emph>La
                    ronde du sabbat</emph>) describes a witches' dance, another treats of sylphs and
                    fairies; the motley superstitions of the old popular legends are
                    revived–Romanticism is not far off. And the tone is anything but classic; in
                    France, as in Germany and Denmark, the style of the popular ballad supplants the
                    dignified, literary style. There is, moreover, in these poems a new patriotic
                    element (<emph>Le géant, Le pas d'armes du roi Jean</emph>) which turns from classic
                    antiquity to the France of the far-off past. Of this national movement, too,
                    Chateaubriand had been the leader; his description of the ancient Gauls in <emph>Les
                    Martyrs</emph> was the first attempt in the new direction; it made a powerful
                    impression (according to his own confession) on such a man as Augustin Thierry,
                    the future author of <emph>The Age of the Merovingians</emph>; we may safely say that it
                    gave the impulse generally to a more graphic and animated historical style. But
                    even this patriotic element was new and foreign to French poetry, was
                    consequently a rebellion against tradition. The revival of old French subjects
                    was accompanied by a revival of old French metres. Here also Chateaubriand led
                    the way with that charming exile's song beginning with the beautiful lines:</p>

                <p>The metre, the picturesqueness, the melodiousness, and the concision which
                    distinguish such verse were something quite new in French poetry.</p>

                <p>It seemed at first as if the principle of authority had received new and powerful
                    support from the re-engrafting of the traditions of Christianity and monarchy
                    upon literature. But it soon became evident that religious and literary
                    tradition could not thrive together. The former at first took refuge under the
                    wings, in the very bosom of the latter, but the inherent antagonism soon
                    revealed itself, and the principle of authority in its literary shape was set
                    aside, nay, overthrown by the new spirit, which had all the appearance of
                    sincerely desiring to uphold the practical, that is to say, the
                    politico-religious principle of authority.</p>

                <p>We have now to see how the practical principle of authority came to share the
                    fate of the theoretical, the literary principle.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Victor Hugo, <emph>Odes et Ballades; Cromwell</emph>; A. de Vigny, <emph>Poésies complètes</emph>;

                <p>On a dark, foggy day in February 1854, a little company of friends followed the
                    remains of one of France's most notable men to a Paris cemetery. The procession
                    made its way between two ranks of soldiers, who were there not to show honour,
                    but to preserve order, to the »common trench.« Such had been the will of the
                    deceased. When the earth had been thrown on the coffin, the grave-digger asked:
                    »Is there no cross?« »No,« was the answer.</p>

                <p>No monument shows where that dead man was laid, though his name was known
                    throughout Europe, and there is no cross upon his grave, though he had been an
                    abbé and a priest, in fact for a long period the most notable champion of the
                    church. It was Lamennais who by his own wish was buried thus.</p>


                <p>Félicité de la Mennais (it was not till late in life that he gave his name the
                    more democratic form) was born in 1782 at St. Malo; so he, like Chateaubriand,
                    is a Breton; and the obstinacy of his race was innate in his character. The
                    Breton authors constitute what may be called the Vendée of literature; they
                    continue with words the fight which their fathers fought with material
                    weapons.</p>

                <p>As a youth Lamennais was slight, thin, and of an excitably lively temperament. At
                    an early age he lost his mother, and after this was even more determined and
                    self-willed than he had been before. His religious vocation was long doubtful;
                    as a youth he devoted much time to music and mathematics, played the flute, and
                    learned the use of various weapons. He fought a serious duel, which proved a
                    hindrance to him in the career which he subsequently<!-- Illustration: [LAMMENAIS] --> <pb n="253"/> chose, had love affairs,
                    and wrote poetry.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">

                    He was so little inclined to accept the dogmas of
                    Christianity that he did not make his first communion till he was twenty-two,
                    when he had attained to settled religious convictions. After this he began to
                    study theology, and in 1808, at the age of twenty-six, he took the tonsure. But
                    when the time of his ordination as a priest drew near, he was seized with such
                    horror of the vow he was about to take that he again and again postponed the
                    decisive step, and did not really become a priest until he was thirty-five. His
                    letters of these years show the distracted condition of his soul; the proud
                    heart winced and writhed at the thought of giving the power over itself into
                    strange hands. And things were no better when all was over and the irrevocable
                    vow taken. The first letter he wrote to his brother after the dreaded
                    ordination, to which he had finally been persuaded to consent, had actually
                    taken place, gives a gloomy description of his mental condition:</p>

                <p>»Although silence has been imposed on me, I believe that it is both allowable and
                    right to let you know once and for all exactly how matters stand with me. I am
                    extremely unhappy, and it is impossible that I can henceforward be anything
                    else. They may reason as they like, may twist and turn things as they please, to
                    persuade me of the opposite, but there is not the slightest probability that
                    they will ever succeed in convincing me of the non-existence of a fact which I
                    perceive. The only consolation I can accept is the cheap counsel to make a
                    virtue of necessity.... All I desire is forgetfulness, in every acceptation of
                    the word. Would to God I could forget myself!«</p>

                <p>With such throes as these was the birth of Lamennais' faith in his religious
                    vocation accompanied. He overcame <pb n="254"/> his despair; he, to whom it was a necessity to
                    be whatever he was with his whole soul–even if it was the opposite of what he
                    had been before–became with his whole soul a priest. So absolutely did he feel
                    himself one that his first angry exclamation when Rome left him in the lurch in
                    1832 was: »I will teach them what it means to defy a priest!« He had a strong
                    character and a narrow mind; a born party man, it was his nature to take a side
                    obstinately and blindly, to defend what he for the moment regarded as absolute
                    truth with passionate love and eloquent hate. Hence as soon as the ruling idea
                    of the period takes hold of him he becomes its doughtiest champion–the most
                    ardent, the most consistent, the most sincere and most undaunted defender of the
                    autocratic principle of authority and the unconditional submission which that
                    principle demands. The man who had suffered such agony of mind in yielding up
                    his own reason and will to the will of the church, the one real priest of the
                    Neo-Catholic school, seems, as it were, to grudge other men better conditions
                    than had been granted to himself. When, in language ominous of storm, he
                    proclaims the gospel of authority and obedience, he, beyond all others, makes us
                    feel how personal passion finds satisfaction in the sweeping, universal demand,
                    how the Ego which has felt itself compelled once for all to submit to authority
                    asserts itself by bending and bowing the wills and thoughts of all other men to
                    that rule with which it now identifies itself.</p>

                <p>Violent and obstinately independent, Lamennais certainly recognised no authority
                    within his own camp. His remarks upon the other leaders of the school form a
                    pleasing collection of invectives. Of Bonald, for instance, he writes: »Poor
                    humanity! How M. de Bonald should be suggested to me by the word 'humanity'
                    passes my comprehension. The transition is an abrupt one. They say that the poor
                    man has become quite feeble-minded lately.« Of Chateaubriand: »The King and he,
                    he and the King–this is the whole history of France.... No one can understand,
                    he least of all, how Europe is to dispense with his talents. He prophesies that
                    Europe will fare ill.« <pb n="255"/> Of Frayssinous, who as leader of the Gallican party in
                    the church was his opponent: »You call him moderate. Why? Because your attention
                    has been drawn to something cold in him, which you take to be moderation, but
                    which is only congealed hatred.« Such is the tone of Lamennais' letters. There
                    was, nevertheless, in his vigorous and, if not blindly precipitate, at least
                    blindly impetuous character the very stuff to make a matchless champion of the
                    absolute authority of the church–and this, till the end came, he proved to
                    be–a champion whose capacity of subjecting others to discipline was greater
                    than his capacity of allowing himself to be persuaded against his honest
                    conviction.</p>

                <p>In 1808 he published his <emph>Reflections on the Position of the Church in France</emph>, a
                    work which was suppressed by Napoleon's government. He greeted the returning
                    Bourbons with enthusiasm. But he was not yet famous. Between 1817 and 1823,
                    however, there was published, volume by volume, a work which kept men's minds in
                    a constant ferment, and gave occasion to violent controversy; between the
                    publication of the second and third volumes its author had to take up his pen in
                    his own defence. This work was the Abbé de la Mennais' <emph>Essai sur l'indifférence
                    en matière de religion</emph>. In it the period of the restoration of ecclesiasticism
                    collects all its powers for a last, decisive battle. We find all the leading
                    principles of the day enunciated with a peremptoriness and a determined
                    consistency in the drawing of conclusions which seem to indicate that the
                    revulsion is at hand.</p>

                <p>The tendency and even the title of this book suggest comparison with the work
                    which inaugurated the religious revival in Germany in the beginning of the
                    nineteenth century, Schleiermacher's famous <emph>Reden über die Religion an die
                    Gebildeten unter ihren Verächtern</emph> (Lectures upon Religion to the Educated
                    amongst those who despise it). Both works aim at counteracting the same thing,
                    the indifference towards religion, the positive contempt for it, prevailing
                    amongst the educated classes. Both make an attempt, now that faith has become
                    weak, to rebuild the edifice of piety upon a new foundation. It is in this
                    attempt that the different nationality of the authors makes itself strongly
                    felt.</p>

                <p><pb n="256"/> Schleiermacher, emotional and fervent, is of opinion that the only hope for
                    religion lies in surrendering all its outworks and leading it back to its inmost
                    stronghold, the purely personal <emph>feeling</emph> of the individual. He tries to
                    penetrate to the very foundation of human existence, to the depth where both
                    consciousness and action originate, to the sources of personal life. He calls
                    upon his reader to try to realise the original condition of the soul, in which
                    the Ego and the object are blent in one, where there is consequently no question
                    either of perception of the object or of perception of a self differing from the
                    object. He describes this as a condition which we are incessantly experiencing
                    and yet not experiencing, since all life consists in its perpetual cessation and
                    recurrence. It is, he says, evanescent and invisible, like the fragrance exhaled
                    by dew-laden flowers and fruits, chaste and light, like a virginal kiss, and
                    holy and fecund, like a bridegroom's embrace; nay, it is not only <emph>like</emph> all
                    this, it <emph>is</emph> all this; for this condition of the human soul is the marriage of
                    the universe, of the All, with reason personalised; in this condition the
                    individual is for a moment the world-soul and feels its infinite life to be his
                    own. »This,« says Schleiermacher, »is the nature of the first conception of
                    every living and original energising force in your lives, to whatever province
                    it may belong; it is such a condition that produces every religious
                    emotion.«<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom"><emph>Reden über die Religion</emph>. Fifth edition, pp. 50, 54, 56.</note></p>

                <p>In consequence of this theory Schleiermacher regards every feeling, every
                    emotion, in so far as it expresses the united life of the Ego and the All in the
                    manner described, as religious. »The feelings, the feelings alone, provide the
                    elements of religion.« He maintains that there is no feeling which is not
                    religious, unless it is the product of a diseased or depraved condition, adding
                    a note to the effect that this holds good even of the feelings of sensual
                    enjoyment, so long as they are not contrary to nature or depraved. His endeavour
                    is to rescue religion from antagonism with science and culture by making it out
                    to be the essence of every noble, nay, of every healthy feeling. A true German,
                    he pantheistically maintains that <pb n="257"/> the broad stream of life which flows through
                    all created beings is the sacred fountain of all piety and all religions.
                    Therefore he would do away with every definite religious system; even belief in
                    God and immortality does not seem to him to be essential to religion. He
                    exclaims enthusiastically: »Join with me in reverently offering a lock to the
                    holy, outcast soul of Spinoza in the realm of shades. He apprehended the great
                    world-spirit; the infinite was to him all in all, the universe his one and
                    eternal love; with holy innocence and deep humility he mirrored himself in it,
                    and it in return found its most pleasing mirror in him. He was full of religion
                    and of the spirit of holiness.«</p>

                <p>Even the age of enlightenment did not deal so-called revealed religion a severer
                    blow than did this emotionalism. Schleiermacher, as we see, resolves religion
                    into feeling, and in so doing destroys its authority by making over this
                    authority to the human soul in all its endless variability. All rules,
                    ordinances, dogmas, and principles disappear; each individual is, by a special
                    process, to make everything his own. For Schleiermacher maintains that »however
                    perfectly a man may understand such principles, however firmly he may be
                    convinced that he possesses them, if he does not know and cannot prove that they
                    have arisen in himself as expressions of his own spiritual life and are
                    consequently originally his own, we must not let ourselves be persuaded to
                    believe that such a man is a religious man. He is not; his soul has never
                    conceived; his religious ideas are only supposititious children, the offspring
                    of other souls, whom he, in the secret feeling of his own impotence, has
                    adopted.«</p>

                <p>Thus essentially Protestant in the good (hence not the sectarian) sense of the
                    word is the religious revival in Germany in its beginnings. It asserts
                    <emph>personal</emph> originality to be the one essential factor in religion, and defines
                    as the province of religion the whole widespread realm of our warm, true
                    feelings. Natural, healthy feeling is always holy, at no time peculiarly
                    holy.</p>

                <p>A marked and significant contrast to all this is provided by the principles set
                    forth in Lamennais' great work, which <pb n="258"/> forms the Latin and Catholic counterpart
                    to Schleiermacher's Lectures. These principles, the programme of pure
                    externality, are as follows:</p>

                <p>1. That <emph>feeling</emph> or indirect revelation is not the means by which men are
                    intended to attain to the knowledge of true religion.</p>

                <p>2. That <emph>scientific research</emph> or <emph>reasoning</emph> is not the means by which men are
                    intended to attain to the knowledge of true religion.</p>

                <p>3. That <emph>authority</emph> is the means by which men are intended to attain to the
                    knowledge of true religion; and that consequently the true religion is
                    unquestionably the religion which rests upon the strongest possible visible (!)
                    authority.</p>

                <p>It is to prove these three remarkable and droll assertions that Lamennais has
                    written his four thick volumes. Let us make ourselves acquainted with their very
                    imperfect chain of reasoning.</p>

                <p>It is of paramount importance to us human beings to discover an infallible
                    criterion of what is true and what is false. What we seek is <emph>certainty</emph>. But
                    where are we to find it?</p>

                <p>We cannot derive it from our senses, for our senses deceive us, says Lamennais.
                    That the senses conjointly correct such false impressions as each sense
                    separately produces, is a fact of which he does not take cognisance. We are, in
                    his opinion, the less certain of any necessary connection between the
                    impressions of our senses and the reality of things, from our not even being
                    certain of our own existence. How we, if we are not certain of that, can be
                    certain of anything whatsoever, is a question he leaves unanswered.</p>

                <p>Conviction, the inward feeling that the thing must be so, is, he affirms, as
                    deceptive as are the impressions of the senses. The irresistible force with
                    which a principle imposes itself upon our reason affords no proof of the truth
                    of that principle. Error is always possible. That one may quite well acknowledge
                    one's fallibility generally speaking, and yet regard one's self as certain of
                    the truth in many single, definite cases, is another fact he leaves out of
                    reckoning.</p>

                <p><pb n="259"/> Next comes the turn of scientific research or reasoning. This, he maintains,
                    leads to doubt of everything, for the highest of all principles do not admit of
                    proof; we are not certain, moreover, of the reliability of memory. It is
                    impossible to parry this attack upon the scientific method in so far that it is
                    of course impossible to prove the reliability of memory without pre-supposing
                    the reliability of the memory which is to be proved. But of the indirect proofs
                    of the reliability of memory provided by human experience Lamennais does not say
                    a single word.</p>

                <p>He touches provisionally upon the subject of complete doubt. Complete doubt would
                    lead to complete insanity. The spirit of self-preservation compels us to believe
                    and to act according to our belief. It is, in the Abbé's opinion, this want of
                    ability to doubt, or the knowledge that one will, if one doubts, be regarded by
                    other men as ignorant or mad, which forms the foundation of all human certainty.
                    Common consent (<emph>sensus communis</emph>) thus becomes for us the seal of truth, and
                    there is no other. Difference of opinion at once begets uncertainty. A principle
                    or a fact is more or less certain according as it is more or less universally
                    accepted and borne witness to. Hence Lamennais' definition of a science is: A
                    science is a collection of thoughts and facts on which all men are agreed.
                    Though his standpoint is a different one, he resembles the English empirical
                    philosophers of a later day in refusing even to such a science as geometry any
                    foundation but that of common consent. The fact that many a mistaken scientific
                    conclusion has been taken for truth is due, he believes, to the circumstance
                    that science has reached only a small number of human beings. What, he exclaims,
                    are a few hundred savants compared with the whole human race! He strangely
                    enough forgets that the human race has never unanimously accepted a single
                    scientific truth previous to its discovery by men of science, in fact has never
                    shown original unanimity in any belief.</p>

                <p>Lamennais asks: When two persons disagree, what do they do after they have in
                    vain attempted to over-persuade <pb n="260"/> one another? and he answers: They appeal to
                    arbitration. But what is arbitration? Arbitration is <emph>authority</emph>, and this
                    authority declares with which of the differing opinions certainty, or if not
                    certainty, at least probability rests. The fact that the arguments of reason, as
                    such, only create doubt, and the fact that the strongest proof of the
                    mistakenness of an assertion always is: »You are the only one who thinks thus,«
                    direct us to the <emph>principle of authority</emph> as the only true and final
                    principle.</p>

                <p>Lamennais' theory, consistently developed, would lead to acceptance of the vote
                    of the majority as the proof of truth. But our final destination is, as we know,
                    the Catholic religion. It is interesting to follow the vaults by which the
                    principle of authority, conceived of as it is in this work, carries us straight
                    into the arms of the church.</p>

                <p>Lamennais begins by defining all learning, all apprehension, as the obeying of an
                    authority. This is the same as Bonald's theory, that we accept language upon the
                    authority of those who teach us it, and accept along with it the truths which
                    are necessary to self-preservation, truths which God in his all-powerful word
                    (<emph>i.e.</emph> language) has revealed to every people upon earth. Our intellectual
                    life, <emph>the law of which is obedience</emph>, is, then, simply a participation in the
                    highest reason, a perfect harmony with the witness which the infinite being has
                    borne of himself. Divine reason, which communicates itself by means of language,
                    is the first cause of the existence of reasonable beings, and faith their
                    necessary manner of being. Thus the principle of certainty and the principle of
                    life are one.</p>

                <p>Man being created for truth, the reason of universal humanity cannot err. Very
                    different is it with the reason of the individual, which can be overwhelmed by
                    doubt. If it separates itself from society it dies. <emph>Væ soli!</emph> exclaims
                    Lamennais. The proud man imagines when he is required to bow to authority that
                    what is demanded of him is that he shall yield up his reason. He is mistaken.
                    Authority is simply universal reason, reason revealed through a witness. »It
                    animates and preserves the universe which it has created. Without it no
                    existence, no truth, no order.«</p>

                <p><pb n="261"/> It is, then, authority alone which gives us certainty concerning religion.
                    »Religion is not only doctrine, not only systematised knowledge–it is also, it
                    is essentially, a law.« But there is no law without authority; these two ideas
                    involve each other. Thus religion is necessarily based upon authority–the true
                    religion upon supreme authority. It is defined as: »The sum of the laws which
                    follow from the nature of reasonable beings;« and to learn what these are we
                    must, consequently, have recourse to authority.</p>

                <p>Let us follow the connecting thread in this network of sophisms, that we may be
                    able to pull it to pieces. It runs thus: Reason is developed only by the aid of
                    language, the witness. The witness is only to be found in society. Hence man can
                    only live in society. Hence there must have been society, intercourse, between
                    God and the first man. (Observe the unproved assertion of the existence of an
                    Adam, also Bonald's doctrine that God gave Adam language–in short, elements
                    taken from so-called revealed religion as authority, employed to prove that
                    so-called revealed religion rests upon authority.) The necessity of witness
                    involves the necessity of faith, without which witness would be of no effect.
                    Hence faith lies in the very nature of man, is the first condition of life. The
                    certainty of faith is founded upon its harmony with reason, <emph>i.e.</emph> upon the
                    strength of the authority which bears witness. Hence the witness of God is
                    infinitely certain, since it is nought else but the revelation of infinite
                    reason or of supreme authority. No witness is possible except where there is
                    society. Hence no authority or certainty is possible without a society. No human
                    society can exist except in virtue of that original society of God and man which
                    came into being by virtue of the truths or laws originally revealed by his word.
                    Hence these truths cannot be lost in any society without the destruction of that
                    society resulting from the loss. They are consequently to be found in every
                    society. These essential truths are preserved only by means of witness, which
                    has no power or effect without authority. Hence, as there is no authority except
                    in society, there is also no society without authority; where there <pb n="262"/> is no
                    authority, there is no society. But it is to be noted that there are two species
                    of society; for man stands both in temporal relations to his fellow-men, and in
                    eternal relations to them and to God. These two societies are the political or
                    civil (temporal) society and the spiritual (eternal) society. Consequently there
                    are two authorities, and these authorities are <emph>infallible</emph>, each in its own
                    domain.</p>

                <p>This all sounds extraordinarily logical; if <emph>ergo</emph> were a sufficient proof, there
                    would be no want of proofs. But let us examine one or two of the links in the
                    chain of argument.</p>

                <p>The Ego, says Lamennais, cannot alone, in solitude, develop self-consciousness.
                    The premise is correct, and we infer from it what there is to infer when we say
                    that the <emph>I</emph> has consequently developed with the assistance of a <emph>you</emph>. This is
                    a thought to which Feuerbach has devoted special attention, and which he has
                    followed out in a variety of directions. But Lamennais, taking as his premise
                    the Old Testament supposition of a single man existing before the rest of the
                    race, builds the doctrine of the communication between this man and God, and all
                    that follows thereon, upon this foundation, which sinks with the edifice erected
                    on it.</p>

                <p>Lamennais declares the infallible sign of the truth to be universal consent. <emph>But
                    upon what does the authority of this consent rest?</emph> Has it a cause, or is it
                    simply a fact?</p>

                <p>If it has a cause, if the reason of all is to provide the law for the reason of
                    the individual, then that very individual reason for which Lamennais has such a
                    profound contempt is, after all, the supreme judge of the truth. For it is it
                    which, in the first place, invests universal consent with its great importance,
                    and in the second, determines in each separate case whether or not universal
                    consent is to be bestowed.</p>

                <p>If, on the other hand, the authority of common consent is a fact, that is to say,
                    a thing which simply follows from our nature, then the certainty with which it
                    inspires us is in no wise different from any other certainty. But Lamennais
                    himself has just been opposing the idea of <pb n="263"/> certainty resulting from an inward
                    feeling, been denying our certainty even of our own existence, the certainty
                    which we require being <emph>infallible</emph> certainty. What on earth should make belief
                    in authority more infallible than any other certainty?</p>

                <p>Lamennais' chain of argument leads us finally to two infallible authorities. The
                    word »infallible« tells us that the Roman Catholic Church is not far off.
                    Infallibility insinuates itself as an inevitable consequence of authority.</p>

                <p>There is one point on which all the writers who help to bring about the revival
                    of ecclesiasticism agree, on which Joseph de Maistre, the inaugurator of the
                    revival, is in perfect harmony with Lamennais, its last exponent, little favour
                    though he shows to the other paradoxes of his latest disciple. This point is the
                    infallibility of the Pope. It must be remembered that in the eighteenth century
                    the Papal power had appeared to be defunct. A Pope had corresponded with
                    Voltaire and accepted the dedication of his <emph>Mahomet</emph>. The Pope had himself done
                    away with his faithful Janissaries, the Jesuits. The religious reaction begins
                    by the re-assertion, nay, by the exaggeration even from a Roman Catholic point
                    of view, of the power and importance of the Pope. De Maistre said: »Without the
                    Pope, no authority; without authority, no faith«–that is, without a Pope, no
                    faith. The supremacy of the Pope thus becomes the very fountain, the very kernel
                    of Christianity; in our days (in the writings of Bishop Ségur) the Pope has
                    actually become a sacrament, »the real presence of Jesus upon earth.«</p>

                <p>De Maistre argued thus: There is no religion without a visible church; there is
                    no church without government, no government without sovereignty, and no
                    sovereignty without infallibility. He cited the principle of the
                    irresponsibility of the king, which, in his estimation, was essentially the same
                    as that of the infallibility of the Pope. Every government, he insisted, is from
                    its very nature absolute, endures no insubordination; from the moment when it
                    becomes permissible to oppose it, on the pretence of its being unjust or
                    mistaken, it can no longer be called a government. And he attempted, as we have
                    already seen, <pb n="264"/> to prove, by appeal to the unquestioned discipline prevailing on
                    board ship and the unquestioned decisions of the courts of justice, how familiar
                    men are in all other domains of life with that idea of infallibility which it is
                    considered correct to take umbrage at where the Pope is concerned.</p>

                <p>This dexterous defence has every merit conceivable in a defence of an
                    irredeemably lost case. That we are obliged to regard the temporal sovereign,
                    though he is not infallible, as being so, does not prove that the Pope, as the
                    spiritual sovereign, really is infallible. The fact that there must always be a
                    supreme power, qualified to demand outward submission, does not prove that this
                    power has also the right to demand intellectual submission. But perhaps outward
                    submission is sufficient? Joseph de Maistre in reality grants that it is. He
                    writes: »As regards the dogma of the infallibility of the Pope, we have no
                    <emph>interest</emph> in throwing doubt upon it. When one of those theological questions
                    which must of necessity be submitted to the arbitration of a supreme court
                    occurs, it is of no interest to us whether it is decided in this way or that,
                    but it is of great interest that it should be decided at once and without
                    appeal.«</p>

                <p>Lamennais, who like De Maistre arrives at the conclusion that there are two
                    infallible authorities, the authority of the state and the authority of the
                    church, goes, as being a generation younger than his master, a stage farther on
                    the road they both tread. When it proves to be impossible in the long run to
                    uphold the two authorities, each in its own domain, he does not hesitate to
                    decide which of them, in case of a collision, must give way to the other. He
                    draws his final inference thus; »Spiritual authority corresponds to the
                    inalterable law of justice and truth, temporal authority to the force which
                    compels rebellious wills to submit to this law. <emph>Force is necessarily
                    subordinate to the law, the state to the church</emph>. Otherwise we should have to
                    acknowledge two independent powers–the one the preserver of justice and truth,
                    the other blind, and therefore by its nature destructive of justice and
                    truth.«<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom"><emph>Du progrès de la révolution et de la guerre contre l'église</emph>.</note> <pb n="265"/> A haughty conclusion this, and most characteristic of the beginning
                    of the nineteenth century!</p>

                <p>It proves what power Lamennais desired the Catholic Church to possess. We have
                    still to note the last vault, by which it is proved that the Catholic Church
                    <emph>is</emph> the authority of which so much has been written. Lamennais writes: »In the
                    choice of a religion, then, the question reduces itself to this–Is there
                    anywhere to be found such an authority as that which we have described, or, in
                    other words, is there a spiritual and visible society which declares (!!) that
                    it possesses this authority? We say a visible society, for every witness is
                    external (remember that the witness of the inward voice is rejected), and we
                    affirm that such witness would afford conclusive proof of the authority spoken
                    of, because it would be the expression of the most universal reason.«</p>

                <p>»If such a society did not exist, the only true religion would be the traditional
                    religion of the human race, <emph>i.e.</emph> the sum of the dogmas and precepts which are
                    hallowed by their being traditional in every nation, and which were originally
                    revealed by God.«</p>

                <p>»But if there is such a society, then its dogmas and precepts constitute the true
                    religion.« From this climax the rest of the argument follows of itself: »Since
                    the death of Jesus Christ Christian society has incontestably been in possession
                    of the highest authority. Of the various Christian communities the Catholic
                    Church is clearly stamped as that possessing most authority. In it alone are to
                    be found all the truths of which man stands in need; it alone provides him with
                    perfect knowledge of the duties or laws of reason; in it alone he finds
                    certainty, salvation, and life.«</p>

                <p>Now we have reached the desired haven. But it is not enough that we have reached
                    it in a perfectly disabled condition–we suffer shipwreck within the harbour.
                    For Lamennais frankly confesses at the end of his book that all religions rest
                    upon authority, but that nevertheless the original traditions of all except one
                    have been more or less corrupted by additions which must be regarded as errors.
                    These errors have, however, also been validated by authority, <pb n="266"/> exist only by its
                    permission. What a confession! It destroys the virtue of his whole argument.</p>

                <p>But of this Lamennais is quite unconscious. He approvingly quotes the following
                    utterance of a Catholic writer: »The Catholic religion is a religion of
                    authority, and therefore it alone is a religion of certainty and peace,« and
                    triumphantly recalls Rousseau's saying, that if any one could persuade him on
                    Sunday that he was in duty bound to submit in matters of faith to the decision
                    of another, he would on Monday become a Catholic, and that every thoughtful,
                    truthful man placed in the same position would act in exactly the same manner.
                    Lamennais claps his hands with delight at having produced such a proof of its
                    being right for the individual to submit to authority in matters of faith. A
                    pretty proof!</p>

                <p>One of two things must be the case. The authority of the Catholic Church either
                    does, or does not, rest upon the universal acknowledgment of its validity. If it
                    does, then the authority of the church <emph>is</emph> universally acknowledged and needs
                    no vindication, since no one denies it. If it does not, then, according to
                    Lamennais' own theory, it is invalid, and no defence is of any avail.</p>

                <p>But we cannot stop here. The doctrine that universal consent is the criterion of
                    what is true, must itself prove its truth by being universally accepted. Can one
                    imagine a more cruel instance of the irony of fate than that the doctrine in
                    question should have been not only universally disputed but actually (in 1832)
                    repudiated by the church itself? Lamennais was then suddenly left in the lurch,
                    <emph>alone</emph> with the doctrine that it is the complete unanimity of all which proves
                    truth. Can one imagine a more absurd contradiction? Yes, a more absurd is
                    possible, namely, the very thing which presently happened–Lamennais, the
                    obedient son of the church, bowing to its authority, himself renounced and
                    abjured his doctrine that the authority of the church is the infallible seal of
                    the truth.</p>

                <p>But we do not need to look so far ahead as 1832 to see how the supporters of the
                    principle of authority came into conflict with their own principle. Whatever men
                    may <pb n="267"/> support, their first requirement is liberty to speak. The divine thing about
                    liberty is that even those who hate it need it and demand it. The <emph>Conservateur</emph>
                    began by ardently vindicating the liberty of the press, but was soon exceedingly
                    inconvenienced by it. One party could not well deny the other's right to a
                    liberty which it had claimed for itself; it could not well do it–but it did it.
                    And the very same thing happened in the matter of parliamentary government, or,
                    as it was then called, <emph>the parliamentary prerogative</emph>. It was the journalists
                    and orators of the Catholic and royalist school who, immediately after the
                    restoration of the monarchy, overthrew the first ministry, a ministry chosen by
                    the king. The Catholics desired to get the helm of the state into their own
                    hands. Thus it was the school of the principle of authority which first
                    sanctioned the very opposite principles–liberty of the press in the widest
                    sense of the word and the power of the parliamentary majority. It undermined the
                    ground upon which authority rested.</p>

                <p>Following the career of the haughty, passionate priest, Lamennais, we can trace
                    the process stage by stage. The constitution (<emph>la Charte</emph>), between which and
                    the monarchy there was an inseparable connection, ensured liberty of religion,
                    on paper at least. But this liberty of religion incensed Lamennais, who knew
                    that one religion alone was the true one. The foolish phrase was then in vogue,
                    that the right to freedom of conscience is the right to be free from conscience.
                    Lamennais and his followers maintained that a man ought to obey his conscience;
                    and this, in their opinion, their opponents did not do. But they forgot that
                    there is a duty which comes before that of obeying one's conscience, namely, the
                    duty of enlightening it. If it be immoral to act against one's conscience, it is
                    not less immoral to manufacture a conscience with the aid of false and arbitrary
                    principles.</p>

                <p>In the name of conscience and authority, then, Lamennais published a protest
                    against the irreligion of the state, that is, against its recognition of no
                    confession–what he called »political atheism.« He started the cry: The laws of
                    France are atheistical. He went farther. In a famous <pb n="268"/> letter addressed to Bishop
                    Frayssinous, and published in the newspaper <emph>Le Drapeau blanc</emph>, he declared that
                    as the generation now to be brought up was a generation born in blood, hard by
                    the scaffold of Louis XVI. and the altar of the goddess of reason, it could only
                    be saved by Christ, only educated by Christianity. But all education in France
                    was, he maintained, atheistic. »Am I exaggerating, Monseigneur, when I say that
                    there are in France educational institutions, more or less closely connected
                    with the University, where children are brought up in practical atheism and
                    hatred of Christianity? In one of these horrible dens of vice and irreligion
                    thirty of the pupils have been known to approach the table of the Lord, receive
                    the sacred wafer, keep it, and commit a sacrilege which formerly would have been
                    punished by law, namely, use it to seal the letters which they wrote to their
                    parents. ... The influence of the University is producing an ungodly, depraved,
                    rebellious generation.«</p>

                <p>These indiscreet revelations were very unwelcome to the party in power, who were
                    much annoyed by such attacks on the constitution from a quarter where they had
                    looked for warm support. When Lamennais found that he was treated with coldness
                    and received reprimands instead of thanks, he went a step farther.</p>

                <p>We have already seen that his doctrine led to the sacrificing of secular to
                    ecclesiastical infallibility in cases of collision between them. But this was in
                    reality equivalent to acknowledging that the heretical, free-thinking school was
                    right in repudiating the quality of inviolability and irreversibility which the
                    royalist writers ascribed to the monarchy by the grace of God. It moreover made
                    the temporal power dependent on the spiritual, namely, on the Pope. All the
                    bishops of France responded with a manifesto in which they declared the secular
                    to be independent of the Papal power.</p>

                <p>Lamennais, the champion of <emph>authority</emph>, now stood in the most strained relations
                    with both the ecclesiastical and the temporal authorities.</p>

                <p>His democratic period does not lie within the scope of the present work. We shall
                    only note the germs of the later <pb n="269"/> development which exist in his original theory
                    of authority. This new theory of authority is fascinatingly unlike the good old
                    hard and fast doctrine propounded by Bonald and De Maistre immediately after the
                    Revolution. The reaction is now much more an affair of reason, consequently much
                    less an affair of immovable principles. Every serious attempt to show the
                    grounds upon which the principle of authority rests must inevitably deal the
                    principle a death-blow; for authority does not rest upon grounds. Lamennais'
                    doctrine, which at first sight seemed so favourable to autocracy, proved on
                    closer inspection to be extremely democratic. The whole edifice rested upon the
                    principle of the authority of the human race. But beneath this fundamental
                    idea–the authority of the human race–another was perceptible; and what was
                    this other but the idea so repugnant to the reactionaries, Rousseau's old
                    idea–<emph>the sovereignty of the people!</emph> Lamennais' readers did not observe this
                    at once; he did not see it himself; but it lay dormant there, and one fine day
                    it awoke and was recognised by all.</p>

                <p>Lamennais desired to substitute theocracy for monarchy. But theocracy was not
                    popular, was at any rate only popular when the word was interpreted in the sense
                    of the old proverb: <emph>vox populi, vox Dei</emph>–when God's voice meant the voice of
                    the people. The practical result of his doctrine was, then, merely the weakening
                    of that secular authority which it asserted to be subject to the fiat of the
                    reason of all; for the reason of all, which had at first been personified in the
                    sovereign church, was very soon personified in the sovereign people. When
                    Lamennais at last, in <emph>Les Paroles d'un Croyant</emph>, instigated to intellectual
                    revolt, all the difference in his position was that he now desired theocracy for
                    the sake of the people, instead of, as formerly, for the sake of their
                    rulers.</p>

                <p>The Revolution of July produced liberty of the press, and the first use Lamennais
                    made of this was to publish a demand for the emancipation of education from
                    state control and for the separation of the church from the state. He hoped by
                    this means to get education altogether into the hands of the church, and thereby
                    restore its old religious tendency. In the autumn of 1830 he started the famous
                    newspaper <pb n="270"/> <emph>L'Avenir</emph>, the watchword of which was the separation of church and
                    state. Appeal to Rome was his answer to every attack; his newspaper was supposed
                    to reflect the exact state of opinion there; but the Vatican remained
                    obstinately silent. The fact of the matter was that it regarded Lamennais'
                    liberal ideas with anything but favour, and had no inclination whatever to
                    relinquish the state grant to the church. His opponents continuing to maintain
                    that his opinions were incompatible with Catholic orthodoxy, Lamennais went to
                    Rome in February 1831, to inquire of the Pope if it was (as he himself put it) a
                    crime to fight for God, justice, and truth, and if it was desirable that he
                    should continue his efforts. He was detained in Rome on one pretext or another
                    until August 1832.</p>

                <p>Presently the bull was published in which he, the opponent of indifference on the
                    subject of religion, is declared guilty of religious indifferentism. In it we
                    read: »From the impure source of this indifference springs also the erroneous
                    and absurd, or, more correctly speaking, insane theory that liberty of
                    conscience should be allowed and secured to all.... But, as St. Augustine said,
                    <emph>what worse death is there than liberty to go astray?</emph> For it stands to reason
                    that when every restraint is removed that can keep men to the paths of truth,
                    their nature, which inclines to evil, will plunge into the abyss.... Amongst
                    these must be reckoned that abominable liberty which we can never sufficiently
                    loathe and dread, the liberty of the press to publish any work whatsoever, a
                    liberty which some dare to champion with such ardour«.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Atque ex hoc putidissimo <emph>indifferentismi</emph> fonte absurda illa fluit ac
                        erronea sententia, seu potius deliramentum, asserendam esse ac vindicandam
                        cuilibet <emph>libertatem conscientiæ</emph>.... <emph>At quæ pejor mors animæ quam libertas
                            erroris?</emph> inquiebat Augustinus. Freno quippe omni adempto, quo homines
                        contineantur in semitis veritatis, proruit jam in præceps ipsorum natura ad
                        malum inclinata.... Huc spectat deterrima illa ac nunquam satis execranda et
                        detestabilis libertas artis librariæ ad scripta quælibet edenda in vulgus, quam
                        tanto convicio audent nonnulli efflagitare ac promovere.</note></p>

                <p>This was plain speaking. Lamennais made submission, and his newspaper stopped
                    appearing. But the cup given him to drink was gall and wormwood, and only a drop
                    was <pb n="271"/> needed to make it overflow. From this time onwards he stood prepared to
                    throw himself into the arms of the Revolution. And ere long he took the
                    leap.</p>

                <p>What most interests us, who are confining our attention to the first stage of
                    Lamennais' psychological development, is to observe the manner in which his
                    childish faith in authority is undermined as soon as he has the opportunity of
                    seeing the holy thing close at hand. He writes from Rome in a private letter:
                    »The Pope is pious, and has the best intentions; but he has little knowledge of
                    the world, and is completely ignorant of the condition of the church and of
                    society; he sits immovable in the darkness which closes in ever thicker round
                    him, weeping and praying; his task, his mission is to prepare and hasten the
                    final catastrophes which must precede the regeneration of society, and without
                    which this regeneration would either be impossible or incomplete. Therefore God
                    has given him into the hands of men who are as base as it is possible to be.
                    Ambitious, greedy, and depraved, in their foolish frenzy they call on the Tatars
                    to produce in Europe what they call <emph>order</emph>.«</p>

                <p>Is it not a remarkable coincidence that Lamennais, too, should end by finding a
                    stumbling-block in the word which had determined the intellectual development of
                    the whole generation? Victor Hugo in his endeavour to vindicate the principle of
                    authority in matters of taste at last feels himself obliged to criticise and
                    enlarge the idea of order; Lamennais in his battle for Catholicism is compelled
                    to do the same. With what passionate grief does he describe in his letters the
                    corruption which he finds prevailing amongst the props and pillars of <emph>order</emph> in
                    Rome!</p>

                <p>»Catholicism was my life, because it is the life of humanity; my desire was to
                    defend it, and to rescue it from the abyss into which it is sinking deeper every
                    day. Nothing would have been easier. It did not suit the bishops that I should
                    do it. There remained Rome. To Rome I went, and there I saw the most shameful
                    sewer that has ever defiled the sight of man. The gigantic <emph>cloaca</emph> of the
                    Tarquinii would be too strait for so much filth. No god but self-interest reigns
                    there; they would sell nations, sell the <pb n="272"/> human race, sell the Three Persons of
                    the Holy Trinity, for a piece of ground and a few piastres.«</p>

                <p>Such was the appearance at close quarters of the power whose most dauntless
                    knight Lamennais had been. Was it any wonder that he turned round! Was it any
                    wonder that he, like the priests of the ancient Saxons to whom Renan has
                    compared him, cut down with a well-directed blow of his axe the divinity to
                    whose altar he had summoned the reluctant world!</p>

                <p>But even more remarkable than this clearsightedness in a single matter are the
                    gleams of profounder general insight which we now find in Lamennais' letters.
                    Hitherto he had sought absolute truth, and had looked to authority to ensure
                    this. Now he suddenly arrives at the idea of relativity, the idea which most
                    thoroughly and utterly demolishes the principle of authority.</p>

                <p>»The older I grow the more it astonishes me to see how all the beliefs which are
                    deepest rooted in us depend upon the age in which we live, the society into
                    which we have been born, and a thousand other equally accidental circumstances.
                    Only think what our beliefs would be if we had come into the world ten centuries
                    earlier, or had been born in this century at Teheran, at Benares, or on the
                    Island of Otaheite!«</p>

                <p>There is more philosophy in these two sentences, which forestall Taine's theory
                    of the influence of surroundings, than in all the volumes of Lamennais' famous

                <p>We have been carried on a few years too far by following Lamennais to the period
                    of his conversion to democracy. At the time of the completion of his book on
                    indifference in the matter of religion, that is in 1823, he, like all the other
                    adherents of the principle of theocracy, still aimed at strengthening the
                    authority of the monarch by means of the authority of the church.</p>

                <p>Presently the particular monarch in question dies, and Charles X. ascends the
                    throne. He ascends it with all possible pomp and ceremonial. He is taken to
                    Reims to be anointed. The ceremony was performed on the 20th of May 1825, and it
                    seemed as if the old royalist and religious superstitions had risen from their
                    graves for the occasion. One of the oldest of these was the belief that crowned
                    heads possessed the power of curing scrofula. This power had been regarded as
                    absolutely indisputable. A lady of Valenciennes, who had been touched by Louis
                    XV., and who afterwards, in the hope of getting into favour, sent in a medical
                    certificate that she was entirely cured of scrofula, received the answer: »The
                    privileges which the Kings of France enjoy in the matter of the healing of
                    scrofula have been attested by such conclusive proofs that they require no
                    further confirmation.«</p>

                <p>This was under Louis XV. Under Charles X. people showed themselves no less
                    orthodox. We remember that at the time of the Revolution the ampulla containing
                    the sacred oil was shivered into fragments. In the eyes of pious Catholics this
                    was sacrilege of the deepest dye. Gregory of Tours, the earliest chronicler who
                    tells of the baptism of Clovis, has evidently no idea that this little
                    fig-shaped vial of <pb n="274"/> heavenly anointing oil was used on the occasion. But some
                    centuries later various traditions on the subject were committed to writing,
                    some of them telling that the Holy Ghost in the form of a dove, others that an
                    angel, had deposited it in the cathedral of Reims; and these traditions, which
                    had survived as popular beliefs, were now freshened up again. The man who had
                    been priest at the church of St. Remi at Reims in 1793, and from whom the sacred
                    ampulla had been taken by force, came forward and declared that before giving it
                    up he had extracted most of the congealed oil which it contained; and this he
                    now produced.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">See the notes to Lamartine's <emph>Chant du sacre</emph>.</note> Another of the faithful asserted that at the time the sacrilege
                    was committed he had collected some fragments of the ampulla, which he had kept
                    until now. The priest and the church officials recognised these fragments as
                    genuine.</p>

                <p>So Charles X. was able to rejoice his subjects with the intelligence that he was
                    to be anointed with the sacred oil of Clovis. The fragments of the old ampulla
                    were introduced into a new one, covered with gold and precious stones, and the
                    precious drops were diluted with others. Particulars of the anointment have
                    already been given in connection with the coronation of Napoleon. At ten o'clock
                    on the morning of the following day, the King mounted a beautiful white horse
                    and rode in the midst of a brilliant retinue, and attended by a troop of
                    hussars, to the hospital of St. Mark. There the chief physician to the royal
                    household awaited him at the head of a band of 121 persons afflicted with
                    scrofula. The King, after offering a short prayer in the hospital chapel, set
                    boldly to his task of curing them. The famous surgeon Dupuytren was not ashamed
                    to hold the heads of some of the patients during the comedy.</p>

                <p>Lamartine celebrated the anointment of Charles X. in a cycle of poems (<emph>Chant du
                    sacre</emph>) and Victor Hugo in an enthusiastic ode. But on the occasion of the same
                    memorable event there was also written a little song which led to its author's
                    prosecution and punishment. The song was called <emph>Sacre de Charles le Simple</emph>,
                    and the name of its writer was Béranger.</p>

                <p><pb n="275"/> The tone of Victor Hugo's ode, <emph>Le Sacre de Charles X</emph>, was, as the following
                    verse shows, orthodox, Biblical, and royalist:</p>

                <p>With the exception of Delavigne, who is a direct descendant of the eighteenth
                    century writers, and who in <pb n="276"/> his <emph>Méseniennes</emph> shows himself to have been an
                    equally ardent revolutionist and patriot, Pierre de Béranger was the only poet
                    who had kept aloof from the dominant group of thinkers and talented writers.
                    Born in 1780, he was nine at the time of the storming of the Bastille, which
                    event left as ineffaceable an impression on his mind as did those writings of
                    Voltaire which he read in his childhood. The following anecdote will serve to
                    show how early he arrived at definite conclusions on religious matters. One day
                    when he was only thirteen years old he was standing laughing scornfully at his
                    aunt, who was sprinkling the room with holy water during a dreadful
                    thunderstorm, when a flash of lightning came into the room, passing so close to
                    him that he fell to the ground unconscious. He was so long in recovering that it
                    was feared he was dead. The first thing he did when he opened his eyes was to
                    call triumphantly to his kind, pious aunt: »Well, was your holy water of any
                    use?« The anecdote has an air of truth, and it is told in depreciation of him by
                    orthodox writers. It was in this same spirit that he now attacked the Bourbons,
                    and their holy water was of no use to them.</p>

                <p>At the very time when they were making themselves ridiculous there occurred a
                    remarkable phenomenon. A poetic halo developed round the once hated name of
                    Napoleon. He was transformed from a historical into a mythical figure; during
                    his own life-time he became a legendary hero. The compulsory inactivity which
                    suddenly followed on a display of energy that had kept all Europe in constant
                    agitation, powerfully affected the popular imagination. There was in reality no
                    element of greatness in Napoleon's compulsory second abdication, and his plan of
                    placing himself under the protection of England was simply a rash one. But the
                    ignoble manner in which the English treated him added to his fame. The far-off,
                    lonely island in the middle of the great ocean became, as it were, a pedestal
                    for the heroic figure. The real Bonaparte was transformed into an ideal
                    Napoleon. History made him over to poetry and legend.</p>

                <p>Even his former enemies could not restrain an expression <pb n="277"/> of admiration for the
                    man in whose direction all eyes turned. Chateaubriand gave utterance to the
                    famous saying, »that Napoleon's grey coat and hat upon a stick, planted on the
                    coast at Brest, would be enough to make all Europe take up arms.«</p>

                <p>Béranger wrote the soulful poem <emph>Les souvenirs du peuple</emph>, which perhaps gives us
                    the simplest and most beautiful picture of the legendary hero, but also that
                    which has least resemblance to the real man, for it makes him out to be as
                    kindly as he is great. It is the poem which begins:</p>

                <p>The young men who not long ago had been thankful to break their ranks and escape
                    from the tyranny of military discipline, now began to look back with longing to
                    the heroic days of the Consulate and the Empire. They had been dreaming, writes
                    De Musset, of the ice of Russia and the sun of the Pyramids, and the world of
                    the day seemed <pb n="278"/> an empty, colourless world. »The King of France sat upon his
                    throne, and some held out their hats for him to throw an alms into them, and
                    others held out crucifixes, which he kissed. And when boys talked of glory, the
                    answer was: 'Become priests!' and when they talked of honour, the answer was:
                    'Become priests!' and when they talked of hope, of love, of energy and life, it
                    was still: 'Become priests!'«<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Alfred de Musset, <emph>Confessions d'un enfant du siècle</emph>.</note></p>

                <p>And so they became priests. Why and how they did it we can learn from the novels
                    which describe the life of the period, such as Beyle's <emph>Rouge et Noire</emph>. This
                    was undoubtedly the priests' golden age. On the 7th of June 1814, three days
                    after the publication of the Charter, the notorious law was passed which
                    prescribed compulsory observation of Sundays and holy-days. Frenchmen were to be
                    Catholics under penalty of fine. Even the adherents of other creeds were obliged
                    to decorate their houses on the occasion of processions of the Holy Sacrament.
                    On the 7th of August 1814 the order of the Jesuits was solemnly re-established.
                    The education of the country was placed in the hands of the clergy. As much of
                    its power as possible was taken from the University, if for no other reason than
                    because numbers of the students had taken part in the defence of Paris against
                    the foreign troops, <emph>i.e.</emph> the allies of the monarchy.</p>

                <p>At this time there begins within the Catholic Church itself a short process of
                    fermentation (to which Joseph de Maistre's and Lamennais' feud with Gallicanism
                    belongs), which in the course of a score of years produces the hitherto unknown
                    phenomenon of perfect unity among Catholics. Catholicism and submission to Rome
                    become one and the same thing. And another, kindred phenomenon, quite as unheard
                    of, is witnessed in our century. Religious unity spreads even beyond the bounds
                    of the Roman Catholic Church. The Protestant Church holds out its hand to the
                    Catholic, which in days gone by it had abominated as the Babylonian whore.
                    Glancing at the later religious development of the century, we find that <pb n="279"/> in our
                    days the difference between orthodox Protestantism and Catholicism is only an
                    apparent difference, only the difference between faith in the infallibility of
                    the Bible and faith in the infallibility of the Pope. The Protestants reject the
                    reason of the eighteenth and the scientific criticism of the nineteenth century;
                    they go back to the creeds of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and do
                    not consider even these orthodox enough; Luther is too advanced for them.
                    Schleiermacher is regarded as a free-thinker by orthodox Germany; Bossuet's
                    attitude is reprobated by French Catholics. He is considered a heretic, in as
                    far as he asserted the independence of the French church. We remember that
                    Joseph de Maistre disapproved of him. Even Montalembert, in his book on the
                    interests of Catholicism in the nineteenth century, mentions him in a
                    condemnatory tone. But the movement does not stop here. The contributors to the
                    Catholic newspapers and periodicals take to writing historical articles which
                    constitute a regular crusade against the great pagan geniuses who founded the
                    civilisation of Europe, such as Pindar, Plato, Virgil. (In Danish literature we
                    have an equivalent in Grundtvig's earliest historical pronouncements.)<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">See Saisset, <emph>La philosophic et la renaissance religieuse. Revue des deux
                        mondes</emph>, 1853, tome i.</note> Hence
                    Montalembert, in the work just referred to, is able to declare triumphantly:
                    »Lying history, parodied history, declamatory history, as written by Voltaire,
                    Dulaure, and Schiller, the men who educated our fathers, would hardly be put up
                    with to-day, even in a feuilleton.« A glance through Lamennais' letters is
                    sufficient to persuade us that one great cause of the Revolution of July was the
                    behaviour of the clerical party. The Jesuits acted as the storming force of
                    fanaticism. Missionaries, whose fervent faith was due to their gross ignorance,
                    were sent to all parts of the country. They sometimes converted whole regiments
                    at a time, and these were then led by their officers in a body to the altar.</p>

                <p>The worship of the Virgin developed in a way it had never done before. Belief in
                    Mary underwent the same change that belief in Christ had done in ancient days, <pb n="280"/> only more quickly. She was gradually transformed from a human into a divine
                    being.</p>

                <p>Let us for a moment follow the course of the religious reaction beyond the period
                    under consideration, and we shall see that this movement has progressed with
                    giant steps. The dogma of Mary's immaculate conception, from which, in the
                    twelfth century, the Middle Ages shrank, has been finally accepted and
                    sanctioned. Mary imperceptibly supplants Christ and becomes the deity of France,
                    as she already was of Italy and Spain. In one of the manuals used in the
                    education of Catholic priests<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom"><emph>Manuel de piété à l'usage des seminaries</emph>, 7 éd. Paris, 1835.</note> we read: »The blessed Virgin is to be honoured
                    as the spouse of God the Father, because with her and in her he begot our Lord
                    and Saviour Jesus Christ; in her we honour all the divine and adorable
                    perfections with which God has endowed her by communicating to her in abundant
                    measure his fertility, his wisdom, his holiness, and his divine fulness of
                    life.« In a work on the immaculate conception written by Archbishop Malou, Mary
                    is represented as being at one and the same time the daughter of God, the spouse
                    of God, and the mother of God; so involved are his explanations of the
                    relationships of the Trinity that one of the conclusions we arrive at is that
                    she is the daughter of her own son. In a book by the Abbé Guillon, <emph>Le Mois de
                    Marie</emph>, she is represented as a kind of chief divinity, to whom consequently it
                    is safest of all to pray. »To be the mother of God means to have a kind of power
                    over God, to retain, if it is permissible to use the expression, a kind of
                    <emph>authority</emph> over him.« Authority thus culminates in the Madonna.</p>

                <p>The Mariolaters, in the manner of the schoolmen of the Middle Ages, set about
                    collecting proofs of the immaculate conception from the writings of the Fathers.
                    One ecclesiastic, Passaglia by name, collected 8000. Archbishop Malou declared
                    himself able to produce not fewer than 800,000 proofs of it. One's head begins
                    to swim. On Mariolatry followed, about the middle of the century, the
                    recrudescence of the worship of relics; for the relics which had stopped working
                    miracles at the time of the Revolution, began to work them <pb n="281"/> again for the
                    generation educated by the Jesuits. In 1844 Bishop Arnoldi of Treves began to
                    exhibit the coat of our Saviour, a seamless linen garment which is mentioned in
                    a falsified clause introduced (as is convincingly demonstrated by two German
                    historians, J. Gildemeister and H. von Sybel) between 1106 and 1124 into a
                    proclamation of Pope Sylvester (327) as having been given by the Empress Helena
                    to the Cathedral of Treves. It is affirmed to be the garment mentioned in the
                    19th chapter of the Gospel of St. John as worn by Jesus before his crucifixion.
                    But besides the sacred coat at Treves, there are some twenty more in other parts
                    of the world, all claiming to be equally genuine. The one in Galatia is much
                    older than the one at Treves. The genuineness of several of them is attested by
                    papal briefs. In 1843 Gregory XVI. ratified the genuineness of the coat at
                    Argenteuil; but Leo X. had already, in 1514, acknowledged the claim of the
                    Treves coat, and its champions would not bow to the new decree; the consequence
                    was that pilgrimages were made to both. Görres, in his <emph>Historisch-politische
                    Blätter</emph>, rejoices at the success of the great pilgrimage to the sacred coat of
                    Treves.</p>

                <p>The religious reaction reaches its climax in the famous Encyclical of Pius IX.,
                    which pronounces free thought to be the delirium of liberty, anathematises civil
                    marriage, separation of church and state, liberty of religion, liberty of the
                    press, liberty of speech, and the erroneous idea that the church ought to make
                    its peace with progress, liberalism, and modern civilisation. But even more
                    severely consistent than the Encyclical are the apologies for it, the German
                    Bishop Kettler's <emph>Die falsche und die wahre Freiheit</emph> and the French Bishop
                    Dupanloup's <emph>La convention du 15 Septembre et l'Encyclique du 8 Décembre</emph>, which
                    explain and justify the Pope's determined stand against »the insolent
                    repudiation of all the great truths which form the foundation of human society.«
                    Let no one, however, imagine that these pamphlets are either very sensational in
                    tone or very full of glaring absurdities. Both in manner and matter they have a
                    strong resemblance to moderate articles in a Danish Liberal newspaper.</p>

                <p>To such results did the Neo-Catholic movement lead. <pb n="282"/> But it is to be noted that
                    these results belong entirely to the domain of political history, and in no way
                    concern literature. <emph>Every movement continues to affect the course of general
                    history long after it has ceased influencing the history of literature</emph>. It
                    affects the latter as long as it has, not only monarchs, nobles, and bishops,
                    but men of distinguished intellect and talent in its service. After 1830 this is
                    no longer the case with the religious reaction in France. The difference between
                    the reaction in 1820 and the reaction with which exhausted and unhappy France
                    was visited after the defeats and the Commune of 1870-71, is that the former
                    vigorous crusade against light had almost every Frenchman of intellect and
                    talent in its service, in its army, whilst the latter could not boast of a
                    single supporter with any literary pretensions.</p>

                <p>We have now to see how that first reaction came to an end. It was, in the first
                    place, attacked from without. The daily press began to declaim against the
                    spirit of antagonism to enlightenment; Béranger sang his songs on the subject;
                    one enterprising publisher, Touquet by name, brought out between the years 1817
                    and 1824 thirty-one thousand copies of the works of Voltaire (1,598,000 vols.)
                    and twenty-four thousand five hundred copies of the works of Rousseau. He was
                    punished and the sale of his books was prohibited; but this aroused such
                    exasperation that the <emph>Globe</emph> prophesied a general apostasy from Catholicism,
                    whereupon the country was again inundated with the Touquet editions.</p>

                <p>The government next wreaked its vengeance on a master of language, the rustic
                    simplicity of whose satiric pamphlets proved an effective offensive weapon.</p>

                <p>Paul Louis Courier, born in Paris in 1773, was one of the cleverest writers of
                    the age. From his father, a rich bourgeois who in his youth had narrowly escaped
                    being murdered because he had had an amour with a lady of rank, he inherited a
                    burning hatred of the indolent and haughty aristocracy. At the age of twenty he
                    entered an artillery regiment and served in the campaigns of the Revolution, but
                    they only gave him a loathing of war. <pb n="283"/> From his earliest youth literature had had
                    a strong attraction for him, especially ancient literature, which he studied as
                    a philologist. In 1795 he left his regiment, which was then besieging Mainz,
                    without permission, and occupied himself with translating Latin authors. In 1798
                    we find him again in the army, in Italy; presently he is studying in Paris; then
                    he returns to Italy in command of a squadron of artillery. He keeps quiet during
                    the Empire, and after its fall lives the life of an agriculturist and Hellenist
                    on his farm in Touraine.</p>

                <p>It was the persecution by the victorious clerical party of every countryman,
                    however insignificant, in whom they detected an enemy, which induced Paul Louis
                    Courier to appear before the public as an author. In 1816 he wrote a <emph>Petition
                    to the Two Chambers</emph>, employing for the first time that plain, shrewd rustic
                    style which, with the purest Greek models in view, he was so successful in
                    acquiring. In simple, clear, always moderate language he tells of the injuries
                    inflicted by clerically disposed provincial tyrants upon unfortunate peasants
                    guilty of not having taken off their hats to a priest or of having »spoken ill
                    of the government.« He confesses that there is probably a good foundation for
                    the accusations, since in his part of the country the priests are not popular,
                    and very few people know what the <emph>government</emph> is. Then he shows how
                    imprisonment for six months without a proper trial, and misery, sickness, and
                    death brought upon the children and other relatives of the prisoners, are the
                    punishment for perfectly trifling offences. Forty gendarmes are sent to a
                    village directly it falls under the suspicion of »Bonapartism«; the suspected
                    persons are taken naked from their beds and fettered like criminals. »They are
                    carried off; their relations, their children would have followed them, if it had
                    been permitted by authority. <emph>Authority</emph>, Messieurs! that is the great word in
                    France.... Everywhere we see inscribed: <emph>Not reasons, authority</emph>. It is true
                    that this authority is not the authority of the councils or of the fathers of
                    the church, much less of the law; but it is the authority of the gendarmes, and
                    that is as good as any other.«</p>

                <p><pb n="284"/> Courier did not write books, or even what we generally call pamphlets. He
                    produced his effect with tracts of a few pages. In these, with apparent naïve
                    downrightness, in reality with consummate satiric art, he kept up an agitation
                    against the rule of the hereditary monarchy until his assassination in 1825.</p>

                <p>A gem of satiric humour is his <emph>Pétition pour les villageois que l'on empêche de
                    danser</emph>. Its occasion was the prohibition by hypocritical magistrates and
                    priests of dancing in the village market-places. He unveils the hypocrisy which
                    lies at the root of the new holy-day regulations, and the harm which they do. He
                    is perfectly aware of the fact that these holy-days were originally ordained for
                    the good of the serfs and bondmen–but there are no serfs and bondmen in France
                    now. Once their taxes are paid, the peasants now work for themselves, and to
                    <emph>compel</emph> them to be idle is ridiculous; it is worse even than the old imposts;
                    those at least benefited the courtiers, but idleness benefits no one. He
                    describes the hot-headed young village priests, who fulminate against dancing
                    and all other pleasures, and compares them with the aged curé of Véretz, who is
                    beloved by his flock for his gentle goodness, but who is hated and persecuted by
                    the authorities because of his having sworn allegiance to the constitution at
                    the time of the Revolution. In a later tract Courier tells of the assassination
                    of this good old man. He writes of everything without resentment, simply
                    ejaculating with a sigh that comes from the heart: »Thy will, O Lord, be done!«
                    He cannot, however, resist adding: »Who could have predicted this in the days of
                    Austerlitz?«</p>

                <p>He grants that the rural population is much more settled and much happier now
                    than it was before the Revolution, but he maintains that it is also much less
                    religious. »The curé of Azai, who wished last Easter to have his canopy carried
                    by four male communicants, could not find four such in the village. The peasant
                    is so happy in possession of the land of which he has so lately become owner
                    (the confiscated lands of the nobility and the church) that he is entirely
                    absorbed in its cultivation, and forgets religion and <pb n="285"/> everything else.« Courier
                    allows that Lamennais is right in reproaching the people with indifference in
                    the matter of religion. »We do not belong to the number of the lukewarm whom the
                    Lord, as Holy Scripture tells us, spews out of his mouth; we are worse; we are
                    cold.«</p>

                <p>Nowhere do we find more graphic descriptions than in Courier's writings of the
                    state of society throughout France during the latter years of Louis XVIII's
                    reign.</p>

                <p>He was again and again imprisoned for his pamphlets; but he did not allow this to
                    intimidate him. In his <emph>Réponse aux anonymes qui ont écrit des lettres</emph> he
                    writes: »It is not my cleverness, but my stupidity which has landed me in
                    prison. I have put faith in the Charter (<emph>la Charte</emph>); I confess it to my
                    shame.... If it had not been for the Charter I should never have dreamt of
                    talking to the public of the things that occupy my thoughts. Robespierre,
                    Barras, and the great Napoleon had taught me for twenty years to hold my
                    tongue.... But then came the Charter, and people said to me: 'Speak, you are a
                    free man; write away, print; the liberty of the press is secured along with
                    every other liberty. What are you afraid of?' ... So I said, with my hat in my
                    hand: 'Will you graciously grant us leave to dance in our market-place on
                    Sunday?'.... 'Gendarmes–off with him to the lock-up. The longest possible term
                    of imprisonment, a fine besides,' &amp;c, &amp;c.«</p>

                <p>In another letter he writes with perfect calmness, and yet with biting severity,
                    of the consequences of the celibacy of the priesthood. One of the priests who
                    had inveighed most fiercely against the harmless peasant dances is discovered to
                    be a seducer and murderer. Some years back he had murdered a woman who had been
                    his mistress. In this case his fellow-priests attempted to throw the blame of
                    the murder on her husband. Since then he has murdered and cut in pieces a young
                    girl whom he had seduced. His superiors have sent him, unpunished, across the
                    frontier, so that he is now an honoured preacher of the Gospel in Savoy. Courier
                    shows what crimes, born of superstition and covetousness, are committed in
                    districts where the inhabitants are so orthodox that nothing would induce them
                    to eat meat on <pb n="286"/> Friday; he says: »This is the true faith–honest, childlike,
                    without suspicion of hypocrisy,« and adds laconically: »They say that morality
                    is founded upon this.«</p>

                <p>The little satire entitled <emph>Pièce diplomatique</emph> he was obliged to publish
                    privately. It is a letter supposed to be written by King Louis to his cousin,
                    Ferdinand of Spain, in 1823, after the war undertaken by France to restore that
                    depraved Bourbon to his throne had been brought to a successful conclusion. In
                    it Courier satirises Louis's attitude to the constitution. His cousin will not
                    hear of a constitution, but Louis maintains that, far from being burdensome, it
                    is agreeable and advantageous to the king.</p>

                <p>Extremely witty is the pamphlet <emph>Simple Discours</emph>, in which Courier ventured to
                    express his disapprobation of the proposal made by the court party to raise a
                    national subscription for the purpose of purchasing the property and castle of
                    Chambord for the heir to the throne. The delicate little Duke of Bordeaux,
                    afterwards Comte de Chambord, was born so long after his father's death that his
                    birth was regarded as a miracle. Lamartine, Victor Hugo, and De Musset all sang
                    of this wonderful event, Lamartine and Hugo comparing the child to Joash. The
                    proposal to raise the national subscription was, thus, made at a time when an
                    enthusiastic feeling prevailed in loyalist circles; but Courier, true to his
                    principles, opposed it from his peasant standpoint.</p>

                <p>Soon all the historians, with the exception of Michaud, began to write in a
                    spirit ominous of danger to the restored monarchy. In 1823 Thiers published the
                    first part of his history, which produced much the same effect as Béranger's
                    songs.</p>

                <p>The government of France had always been in the habit of supporting literature.
                    All the rulers of France had done so, with the exception of Napoleon, and the
                    Bourbons were expected to follow the example of their ancestors. But they gave
                    sparingly, in spite of the enthusiastic welcome and homage which they received
                    from both poets and prose writers. On the few disaffected authors they revenged
                    themselves to the best of their ability; to punish Béranger, his <pb n="287"/> rival,
                    Désaugiers, was made a court favourite; Delavigne was punished with the loss of
                    his post as librarian.</p>

                <p>But more dangerous than the attacks from without were the germs of dissolution
                    which appeared within the school of authority itself. The authors, both prose
                    writers and poets, who formed the Immanuelist or Legitimist group, felt their
                    principles wavering.</p>

                <p>We have already seen that Lamennais was on the verge of defection. And his plight
                    was the plight of all the others; the germs of the new were stirring within them
                    in spite of their sincere desire to defend the old.</p>

                <p>This is particularly observable in the case of Alfred de Vigny, who belongs to a
                    generation a little younger than Lamartine, a little older than Victor Hugo. His
                    family, as we have seen, was royalist. His father, who had been an officer and a
                    brilliant courtier in the days of Louis XV., lost all his property at the time
                    of the Revolution. After the fall of the Empire, Alfred, then sixteen, was
                    equipped at his father's expense and enrolled in the gendarme corps of the
                    guards. When the Hundred Days came, he attended the king on the first stages of
                    his flight; when they were over, he was made a lieutenant in the royal
                    foot-guards. But the time of active service was past, and nothing remained but
                    the tedium of garrison life; the young man sought compensation in unremitted
                    intellectual activity.</p>

                <p>In his boyhood everything had been done to keep his thoughts from turning to
                    Napoleon and all that concerned him. Hence almost before his schooldays were
                    over he donned the white cockade and entered the guard of the Bourbons. But the
                    ungrateful Bourbons, ungrateful because they believed that people owed
                    everything to them, kept him waiting nine years for promotion, when he became
                    captain by seniority.</p>

                <p>When he began to write, his books gave dissatisfaction at the stupid court;
                    though their whole tendency was royalist, they were regarded as seditious. He
                    was accused of liberalism because he exalted Richelieu at the expense of Louis
                    XIII. His father's early inculcations of devotion to the house of Bourbon proved
                    of no avail; he now <pb n="288"/> began to see what that devotion really was–»superstition,
                    political superstition, a groundless, childish old belief in the fealty
                    incumbent on men of noble birth, a kind of vassalage.«<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom"><emph>Journal d'un poète</emph>, 47.</note></p>

                <p>Chivalry might, and did, induce him to preserve the outward appearance of a
                    royalist; he would, for instance, have defended the monarchy during the
                    Revolution of July if his services as an old officer had been required; but at
                    heart he was no longer a monarchist–though this by no means implied that he was
                    a democrat. »The world,« he writes in his diary, »is vacillating between two
                    absurdities, monarchy by the grace of God and the sovereignty of the
                    people.«</p>

                <p>In the matter of religious faith he fell away even earlier. In spite of all the
                    angels and archangels, principalities and powers of his youthful poems, he was
                    suited for anything rather than a champion of the faith. By nature he was
                    melancholy and sceptical, so melancholy that no ray of hope or momentary
                    happiness seems ever to have penetrated into his heart, so sceptical in regard
                    to the creed which he confessed with his lips that he nourished a kind of
                    personal animosity to the idea of God and of the immortality of the soul.</p>

                <p>As early as 1824 we find him giving expression (in his diary) to his conception
                    of life in the following parable: »I see a crowd of men, women, and children,
                    all sound asleep. They awake in a prison. They become reconciled to their prison
                    and make little gardens in its yard. By degrees they begin to notice that one
                    after the other of them is taken away, never to return. They neither know why
                    they are in prison nor where they are taken to afterwards, and they know that
                    they will never know it. Nevertheless, some among them tell the others what
                    becomes of them after their period of imprisonment–tell without knowing. Are
                    they not mad? It is plain that the lord of the prison, the governor, could, if
                    such had been his will, have let us know the charge on which we have been
                    arrested and all the particulars of our case. Since he has not done it, and <pb n="289"/> never will do it, let us be content to thank him for the more or less
                    comfortable quarters he has given us....«</p>

                <p>There is much contempt in this for the theologians, with their pretensions to
                    knowledge, and much acrimony beneath the gratitude to »the lord of the prison.«
                    He adds in the same tone: »How good God is, what an adorable jailer, to sow so
                    many flowers in our prison yard!... How explain this wonderful, consoling pity,
                    which makes our punishment so mild? For no one has ever doubted that we are
                    punished–we only do not know for what.«</p>

                <p>Six years later, employing the same parable, he writes: »I feel myself bowed
                    down, O Lord, by the weight of a punishment which causes me constant suffering;
                    but as I neither know my crime nor the accusation brought against me, I
                    reconcile myself to my prison. <emph>I plait straw</emph> in order sometimes to forget it.
                    For this is what human work amounts to. I am prepared for all possible evils,
                    and I thank Thee, O Lord, for every day which has passed without any
                    calamity!«</p>

                <p>But two years after this he speaks out plainly: »The world revolts at the
                    injustices entailed by its creation; dread of eternity prevents it from speaking
                    openly; but its heart is full of hatred of the God who created evil and death.
                    When a defier of the gods, like Ajax the son of Oileus, appears, the world
                    approves him and loves him. Such another is Satan, such Orestes, such Don Juan.
                    All who have combated the injustice of heaven have been admired and secretly
                    loved by men.«</p>

                <p>De Vigny's diary shows that down to the very last days of the hereditary monarchy
                    the connection between the literary, merely theoretical principle of authority
                    and the practical, working principle was perfectly well understood. Germinating
                    Romanticism was not less ardently opposed by the political opposition (who saw
                    in the young school a support of ecclesiasticism) than by the men who from
                    principle adhered to old tradition. De Vigny tells that he asked Benjamin
                    Constant during the winter of 1819 what was the cause of the extreme disfavour
                    shown by the Left to the poetry of the day. The answer was that the party
                    <emph>wished to avoid <pb n="290"/> the appearance of breaking every chain</emph>, and therefore retained
                    the least irksome, the literary.</p>

                <p>When the Revolution of July came, and put an end to the reign of the Bourbons,
                    Vigny's attachment to the ideas of the restoration came to an end too. He
                    writes: »I feel happy that I have left the army; after thirteen years of
                    ill-rewarded service I may regard myself as quits with the Bourbons.... I have
                    done for ever with burdensome political superstition.«</p>

                <p>Lamartine, too, at this time showed signs of an intellectual development of a
                    suspicious nature. He continued to sing his pious hymns, but the orthodox
                    Genevan pastor, Vinet, discovered that this piety was Christianity only in
                    appearance, and that a most unorthodox pantheism lay concealed beneath the
                    Christian phraseology.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">See Vinet's interesting essays on modern French lyric poetry.</note></p>

                <p>And Victor Hugo, whom one would have taken, judging by his début, to be more
                    reliable, soon showed himself, not only by the style of his poems, but by their
                    tone, to be a doubtful acquisition. In 1822, in the ode entitled <emph>Buonaparte</emph>,
                    he had pronounced Napoleon to be a false god, an emissary of hell; and even as
                    late as June 1825, in <emph>Les Deux Îles</emph> (Corsica and St. Helena), he had caused
                    the nations to shout in chorus to the fallen Emperor: »Honte! Opprobre! Malheur!
                    Anathême! Vengeance!« and the curses of the dead, as the echo of his fatal
                    glory, to roll like thunder from the Volga, the Tiber, and the Seine, from the
                    walls of the Alhambra, from the grave at Vincennes (Enghien's), from Jaffa, from
                    the Kremlin which he had tried to destroy, from all his bloody battle-fields.
                    Now, a year and a half later, Hugo suddenly strikes a different chord. In the
                    first ode <emph>À la Colonne de la Place Vendôme</emph>, written in February 1827,
                    Buonaparte has become Napoleon, and his glory the glory of France. The occasion
                    of the ode was this. At the conclusion of peace in 1814, Austria had demanded
                    that the Frenchmen to whom Napoleon had given titles which conveyed the idea of
                    supremacy over any Austrian town or province should cease to bear these titles.
                    This was all that was required, no objection being raised to titles which merely <pb n="291"/> recalled the French victories in Austria. The French government had persuaded
                    Austria to refrain from making the agreement arrived at public, and the Austrian
                    ambassador contrived to avoid wounding French susceptibility by placing himself
                    on his reception evenings so near the door that it was not necessary to announce
                    the guests. But in the beginning of 1827 this ambassador was recalled, and his
                    successor was ordered by the Austrian government to decide the matter finally.
                    Consequently, on one of his reception evenings, Marshal Oudinot, Duke of Reggio,
                    and Marshal Soult, Duke of Dalmatia, were simply announced by their military
                    titles and their family names. They immediately withdrew, and the affair aroused
                    a great sensation and considerable animosity. As the two officers in question
                    were in high favour with the royal family, the royalist party took up their
                    cause and made it the cause of France. Victor Hugo, who was created to give
                    expression to every prevailing sentiment, and who was conscious before any one
                    else of that movement in men's minds which in the course of a few years was to
                    transform Napoleon into a legendary and national hero, made himself for the
                    first time, in his ode <emph>À la Colonne de la Place Vendôme</emph>, the organ of the cult
                    of the great memories of the Empire. The column, cast of the metal of conquered
                    cannon, which roared as it was melted in the furnace, speaks to the poet in the
                    silent watches of the night, in its character of last remnant of the great
                    empire and the great army. He hears a murmur from the bronze battalions on its
                    sides, hears the sound of names: <emph>Tarentum, Reggio, Dalmatia, Treviso</emph>, sees the
                    eagles on the pedestal whetting their beaks, and feels that the immortal shades
                    are awakening. Who dare think of wiping out this history of France written in
                    blood with the points of swords! Who dare dispute the right of the old generals
                    to the inheritance of Napoleon's glory! Who dare strike at the trophies of
                    France! Every spark struck from the column is a flash of lightning. With
                    magnificent eloquence and ardent enthusiasm Napoleon's history is evolved into a
                    heroic poem, and any sagacious reader of that poem might have foreseen that in
                    the course of a year Hugo (in his poem <pb n="292"/> »Bounaberdi,« in <emph>Les Orientales</emph>, the
                    motto of which is: »Grand comme le monde«) would go over to the veritable cult
                    of Napoleon. And since Bonapartism and Liberalism, in those days shaded off into
                    each other–<emph>vide</emph> Béranger, Armand Carrel, and Heinrich Heine–it would also
                    have been easy to foresee the possibility of his defining Romanticism a few
                    years later (in the preface to <emph>Hernani</emph>) as »liberalism in literature.«</p>

                <p>But what did more than anything else to forward the dissolution of the school of
                    authority was the great and crowning piece of folly, as regards literature,
                    committed by the Bourbons in 1824. Chateaubriand was dismissed in the most
                    contemptuous manner from the Villèle ministry, and that at the moment when he
                    had just added to the reputation of the name of Bourbon by the successful
                    Spanish war, which he himself called his political <emph>René</emph>, that is to say, his
                    political masterpiece. Chateaubriand, the man to whom in a manner everything was
                    due, the man who had laid the foundation stone of the whole building that had
                    been erected, was contemptuously set aside.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">For particulars of this dismissal see Chateaubriand, <emph>Congrès de Vérone</emph>, ii,
                        502, &amp;c; and Guizot, <emph>Mémoires pour servir à l'histoire de mon temps</emph>.</note> And the ingratitude of his
                    colleagues was as glaring as that of the court, for it was he who had made
                    ministers of Villèle and Corbière.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom"><emph>Mémoires d'outre-tombe</emph>, vii. 269, &amp;c.</note></p>

                <p>His popularity amongst the royalists was at this time at its height, and with
                    reason; for the war in Spain, which he had succeeded in carrying through in
                    spite of all manner of opposition in Europe and the disinclination of France
                    itself, was well calculated to do service to the cause of the monarchy by the
                    grace of God, then in considerable disrepute.</p>

                <p>Not that Chateaubriand himself was simple enough to have any respect whatever for
                    that Ferdinand of Spain for whom French troops were to shed their blood, in
                    order that he might be restored to a throne which his own people considered him
                    unfit to occupy. He calls him a promise-breaker and a traitor, calls him a
                    tyrant who allowed <pb n="294"/> himself to be influenced by the evil passions of his female
                    relations, one of those cowardly tyrants who have no peace until they have done
                    some high-handed deed, and who sit and tremble when they have done it.</p>

                <p>Chateaubriand's reason for making war was this. He knew that France was
                    undermined by Bonapartist and Republican plots, which were widely spread even in
                    the army; he knew that discontent with the restored monarchical government was
                    universal; therefore, trusting to the friendship of the Emperor Alexander, he
                    determined, in spite of Canning's protests and Metternich's dissuasions, to
                    stake everything on one card. Victory, which he considered probable, meant the
                    suppression of the plots, the union under the white flag of all the different
                    parties, and the firm establishment of the Bourbons on the family thrones of
                    Spain and France. In the case of victory, which the inward disunion of Spain
                    might even make easy (as it actually did), the French nation would behold the
                    spectacle of the tricoloured flag lowered to the white, and would, for the first
                    time since Napoleon's palmy days, hear tidings of victories won by the arms of
                    France, and that in a country which the great Emperor himself had not been able
                    thoroughly to subdue. All this meant »new laurels for the race of St. Louis,« as
                    Chateaubriand says, and–new laurels for its minister of foreign affairs, a fact
                    which he did not forget to take into account.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Chateaubriand, <emph>Congrès de Vérone</emph>, i. 20, 41; ii. 528.</note></p>

                <p>As we all know, the French army under the command of the Duke of Angoulème, the
                    heir-apparent, succeeded, almost without bloodshed, in liberating Ferdinand at
                    Cadiz, and conducting him back to Madrid. Ferdinand immediately wrote a letter
                    of thanks to Louis XVIII. The answer to this was written for Louis by
                    Chateaubriand; it is amusing to compare it with Paul Louis Courier's imaginary
                    letter from Louis to Ferdinand. Chateaubriand exhorts the Spanish monarch to
                    refrain from high-handedness, »which, instead of strengthening the power of the
                    king, only weakens it«–a piece of good advice to which Ferdinand paid
                    uncommonly little attention.</p>

                <p><pb n="295"/> In its giddy elation over this Spanish triumph the court entirely neglected the
                    man to whom the success was originally due. Chateaubriand was no favourite. The
                    Duchess of Angoulème did not address a word to him when he came, on receiving
                    the news of Ferdinand's liberation, to offer his congratulations on her
                    husband's success. Villèle and Corbière were envious of him, and feared that he
                    might wish to take their places; such an idea had never occurred to him, but
                    they were too deeply in his debt not to bear him a grudge.</p>

                <p>The court and the cabinet plotted to bring about his downfall. On the 5th of June
                    1824 Corbière interrupted him in the middle of a speech in the Chamber, to
                    prevent his enjoying a triumph as an orator immediately before his disgrace. On
                    the following morning, when Chateaubriand, still suspecting no evil, presented
                    himself at the Tuileries to pay his respects to the King's brother, he learned
                    his fate from the manner in which an aide-de-camp said to him: »Monsieur le
                    Comte, I did not expect to see you here. Have you not received anything?«
                    Shortly afterwards his secretary brought him his formal dismissal by the King in
                    the shape of a curt »ordonnance« of a dozen lines. It was little wonder that he
                    felt himself irreparably insulted by the tone of the letter and the manner of
                    his dismissal.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom"><emph>Congrès de Vérone</emph>, ii. 508-528.</note> In mentioning Villèle's attempt to excuse himself by pleading
                    an accidental delay in the delivery of the letter, but for which the humiliating
                    incident at the Tuileries would not have occurred, Chateaubriand justifiably
                    remarks »that it is hardly the thing to address to a man of position a letter
                    which one would be ashamed to write to a footman who was to be turned out of the
                    house.«</p>

                <p>Christian humility was not the leading feature in Chateaubriand's character; he
                    did not turn the right cheek when he was struck on the left. He writes very
                    characteristically: »And yet my long and faithful attachment did perhaps deserve
                    some little consideration. It was impossible for me entirely to ignore what I
                    perhaps after all really was worth, or entirely to forget that I was <emph>the
                    restorer of religion</emph>, the author of <emph>The Spirit of Christianity</emph>.«</p>

                <p><pb n="296"/> The restorer of religion did not feel obliged to act in the spirit of
                    Christianity. He naïvely says: »It would have been better if I had displayed a
                    humbler, more cast-down, more Christian spirit. Unfortunately I am not
                    faultless, have not attained to the perfection recommended in the Gospel. If my
                    enemy gave me a box on the ear I should not turn round and present the other
                    cheek. If he were a subject I should have his life, or he should take mine; if
                    he were the King ...«</p>

                <p>The sentence does not end, because Chateaubriand's behaviour made any end
                    superfluous. He went over openly to the opposition, and it is to be noted that
                    it was to the thorough-going opposition, which had always seemed to him to be
                    the only sensible thing under a representative government, anything less being
                    impotent. The day after his fall he met with a warm reception from the whole
                    party then in antagonism to the government. An article by Bertin in the <emph>Journal
                    des Débats</emph> announced that he had become the leader of the party, and he was
                    soon also practically the editor of that newspaper.</p>

                <p>The whole Seraphic school, of which he was the founder, soon followed him.
                    Lafayette sent him a laurel leaf. Constant flattered him. He began to fraternise
                    with Béranger, who afterwards addressed a poem to him. Two of its verses
                    run:</p>

                <p>Victor Hugo addressed a eulogistic and consolatory ode to him (livre iii. ode 2)
                    containing such sentiments as: Was a court the place for you? and: What can be
                    more beautiful than a laurel scathed by lightning?</p>

                <p>Chateaubriand's defection was a fatal blow to the monarchy by the grace of God.
                    As long as the illusions <pb n="297"/> of the restoration lasted, the poets of France were
                    <emph>Immanuelistic</emph> and saw a guardian angel beside every cradle and every bier.
                    With Chateaubriand's illusions vanished the illusions of all the rest, and the
                    Immanuelistic school was succeeded by one to which Southey gave the name of
                    <emph>Satanic</emph>, a name which it accepted–a school with a keen eye for all that is
                    evil and terrible, a gloomy view of life, and a tendency to rebellion.</p>

                <p>But while the minds of Frenchmen were still occupied with this unexpected and
                    momentous event, there occurred a more momentous event, which stirred the whole
                    world, namely, Byron's death in Greece.</p>

                <p>The news of Byron's death raised the enthusiasm for the first war of liberation
                    that had been fought since the Revolution to fever heat. A new ideal was
                    conceived by the human mind. With Napoleon the glory of energy had passed away,
                    and the heroes of action had for a time disappeared from the earth. Human
                    enthusiasm was, as has been said, in the plight of a pedestal from which the
                    statue has been removed. Byron took possession of the vacant place with his
                    fantastically magnificent heroes. Napoleon had supplanted Werther, René, and
                    Faust; Byron's Promethean and despairing heroes supplanted Napoleon. Byron was
                    in marvellous accord with the spirit and the cravings of the age. Orthodox
                    dogmas had in the early years of the century overcome revolutionary and
                    free-thinking principles; now orthodoxy was in its turn undermined and obsolete.
                    There was at this moment no future for either thorough-going unbelief or
                    thorough-going piety. There remained doubt, as doubt–<emph>poetic</emph> Radicalism, the
                    thousand painful and agitating questions concerning the goal and the worth of
                    human life. These were the questions which Byron asked.</p>

                <p>But he did not ask indifferently. It was the spirit of rebellion which asked with
                    his voice, and which through his voice made of the young generation in all lands
                    one cosmopolitan society. They united their voices with his in the cry:</p>

                
                <cit><quote><lg>
                    <l>… Revolution</l>
                    <l>Alone can save the world from hell's pollution.</l>
                </lg></quote></cit>


                <p><pb n="298"/> His death did far more to advance the cause of liberty in general than his life.
                    Under the restored monarchy by the grace of God society had been reduced to an
                    extreme of believing subjection to authority, of slavish subjection to theology,
                    of dutiful subjection to power–to an extreme of supineness and hypocrisy. That
                    monarchy was rotten to the core, but supported outwardly by superstition and
                    bayonets. In England Bentham, the Radical philosopher, ashamed to see the
                    reaction successful even in that most advanced of countries, had tried to
                    undermine it by appealing to men's <emph>interests</emph>. Byron let loose all the
                    <emph>passions</emph>. His attack was not directed at any one point; he aimed at
                    revolutionising men's minds, at awaking them to the sense of tyranny.</p>

                <p>The politicians of the Holy Alliance period believed that they had bound the
                    spirit of the Revolution in everlasting chains, that they had broken, once and
                    for all, the link which united the nineteenth century to the eighteenth. »Then
                    this one man tied the knot again, which a million of soldiers had hewn through.
                    American republicanism, German free-thought, French revolutionism, Anglo-Saxon
                    radicalism–everything seemed combined in this one spirit. After the Revolution
                    had been suppressed, the press gagged, and science induced to submit, the son of
                    imagination, the outlawed poet, stepped into the breach,« and called all
                    vigorous intellects to arms again against the common enemy.[5] The restored
                    monarchy does not really survive him. The principle of authority has never had a
                    more inveterate opponent.</p>

                <p>In literature the French reaction begins in the name of <emph>feeling</emph> with Madame de
                    Staël and the whole group of writers connected with her; in society it begins in
                    the name of <emph>order</emph> with Robespierre and those revolutionists who were his
                    associates. Madame de Staël and Robespierre have this in common, that they are
                    both pupils of Rousseau. After the reaction against Voltaire comes the reaction
                    against Rousseau. On the festival of the Supreme Being follows the great Te Deum
                    in Notre-Dame; on Madame de Staël <pb n="299"/> follows Bonald. The principle of feeling is
                    ousted, or employed, as in the writings of Chateaubriand, to support authority;
                    the principle of order is merged in the principle of authority, which soon
                    controls every domain of life and literature. This principle is, as it were,
                    personified in the first group of reactionaries, led by Joseph de Maistre and
                    Bonald. It has its epic in <emph>Les Martyrs</emph>, and the idea of order reigns in its
                    poets' descriptions of heaven, of hell, and sometimes even of terrestrial
                    scenery. It has its political monument in the Holy Alliance. The supernatural
                    everywhere supplants the natural. We have not only seraphic epic, but also
                    seraphic lyric poetry, seraphic love, pious pilgrimages, and seraphic
                    predictions and visions.</p>

                <p>In no country had the principle of authority in the domain of literary style
                    received such homage and honour as in France. The new school itself begins by
                    acknowledging it. But it unfortunately soon becomes evident that the principle
                    of the newly introduced matter, namely, Christian tradition, is utterly at
                    variance with the traditional principles of literature–and authority begins to
                    totter. Much the same thing happens in another domain. The lady in whose brain
                    the idea of the Holy Alliance originates stands in high favour with the powers
                    as long as her principles seem entirely to coincide with theirs; the moment they
                    discover that it is possible for Christian tradition to unsettle men's minds
                    with regard to authority, they feel obliged to break the tool they have been
                    using; and thenceforward the idea of the brotherhood of humanity is regarded as
                    the source of rebellious feelings and doctrines which undermine authority.
                    Lamennais is the author by whom the principle of authority is most consistently
                    set forth and determinedly upheld during this period; but it soon becomes
                    apparent that beneath his doctrine of the sovereignty of universal reason lies
                    concealed the revolutionary doctrine of the sovereignty of the people; the
                    principle, as it were, puts an end to itself. At this same time the enemies of
                    the liberty of the press are compelled to make use of this liberty for their own
                    purposes, and the enemies of parliamentary government defend parliamentary
                    government in order to bring about the fall of a ministry which <pb n="300"/> keeps them out
                    of power. Soon all the personages whom we have watched appearing on the scene,
                    from Chateaubriand to Madame de Krüdener, from Victor Hugo to Lamennais, are at
                    war with the potentates whose cause they began by championing with such ardour,
                    and at war with that principle of authority which had ruled themselves and the
                    age.</p>

                <p>And the principle falls, never to rise again.</p>
                
                <p>THE END</p>

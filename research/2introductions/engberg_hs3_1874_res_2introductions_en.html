                    <p>“A book for me is an act,” says Brandes in the afterword to <em>The Romantic
                            School in Germany</em> (Brandes 1873:379). No other book in his
                        authorship manages to live up to this declaration as thoroughly as <em>The
                            Emigrant Literature</em>, the first in the series of lectures that
                        constitute <em>Main Currents in 19th Century Literature</em>, which Brandes
                        delivered as a 29-year-old, newly appointed ldoctor at Copenhagen University
                        in November and December of 1871 and published a month later, on February
                        3rd, 1872. <em>Emigrant Literature</em> was, as the literary scholar Paul V.
                        Rubow has put it, “the bravest action” taken by Brandes in his life as a
                        public figure (Rubow 1976:21), but for the same reason the single work that
                        for better or worse came to seal his fate and his ensuing career as literary
                        scholar, critic and intellectual.</p>
                    <p><em>Main Currents</em> is an ambitiously designed comparative history of the
                        major lines of development in 19th century European literature and identity.
                        It chronicles the history of how the worldly ideals of freedom of the French
                        Revolution of 1789 turned into their opposites, thus leading to European
                        Romanticism, Catholic renaissance and empire, and ultimately how reason and
                        freethinking overcame this reaction in a new movement leading onward toward
                        the European revolutions of 1848, which function as the historical turning
                        point. Emigrant Literature is the first movement – the first act – in this
                        historical drama, which played out among the French émigré authors driven
                        into exile by the repercussions of the French Revolution.</p>
                    <p><em>The Emigrant Literature</em> concerns the connections and the exchanges
                        between literature and social development, and as such was innovative and
                        provocative in that it introduced a modern and scientific vision of human
                        beings and of history, inspired by Darwin’s theory of evolution. But in
                        order to understand the “bravery” and the consequences of the act, it is
                        necessary to view the book in the local Danish context in which it was
                        conceived.</p>
                    <p><em>Emigrant Literature</em> was not only literary history, but also a
                        cultural-political intervention, an act of rebellion directed at
                        contemporary Danish literature, which according to Brandes had become mired
                        in Romanticism and thus now found itself in a state of lethargy – forty
                        years behind Europe. But at the same time it was also an attack on the
                        dominant national self-understanding of Denmark itself, more closely defined
                        as the national liberal cultural ideology with its peculiar synthesis of
                        Christianity, conservative sexual morality and love of fatherland. The
                        program of comparative literary study is meant to “correct” established
                        national orientations by promoting an international outlook (Brandes
                        1872a:15), and its famous battle cry that literature should “provoke debate”
                        (Brandes 1872a:15) made Brandes himself the standard bearer of a process of
                        historical development that concerned not only literature, but the entirety
                        of the social order and the modernization of the culture in a broad sense.
                        The overarching plot of <em>Main Currents</em> is the narrative of the
                        individual’s emancipation from the traditional institutions of society and
                        its authorities, such as Christianity, marriage and the nation. This
                        narrative acquired an especially volcanic character by being forwarded in
                        Denmark – a small, culturally homogeneous national state on the cultural and
                        political periphery of Europe, which after its defeat by Prussia in the
                        Schleswig War of 1864 found itself in a kind of spiritual state of
                        shock.</p>
                    <p>The story of <em>Emigrant Literature</em> is at the same time the story of an
                        academic career plan that went awry. The lecture series was conceived as a
                        part of a plan that would make the brilliant Dr. Georg Brandes a professor
                        at University of Copenhagen, but instead it ended up provoking a public
                        scandal that effectively foreclosed a promising academic career. The public
                        lectures became a hot ticket that filled up university auditoria, yet also
                        gave Brandes the reputation of rabble rouser and blasphemer, which was the
                        very reason that a majority of conservative, High Church professors in the
                        faculty of philosophy opposed the appointment of Brandes to the vacant
                        professorship in aesthetics, for which he had otherwise been the obvious
                        candidate (compare Larsen 2016).</p>
                    <p>Brandes thus had to bid farewell to a secure and respectively bourgeois
                        livelihood as a state-appointed professor. The affair was a decisive factor
                        in his career in that it compelled him to stake his living as an independent
                        journalist in the German press, from his base in Berlin, for the period
                        between 1877 and 1883. But through the German language literary market, he
                        was however able to secure, over the following decades, the status of a
                        leading European literary critic and cosmopolitan mediator between European
                        literatures – a “guter Europäer und Cultur-Missionär” [a good European and
                        cultural missionary], as the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche called him in a
                        private letter of 1887 (Brandes 1966:441). <em>Emigrant Literature</em> is
                        thus also the gateway to an expansive contribution to criticism that
                        encompasses not only the six volumes of <em>Main Currents</em> but also a
                        long series of portraits of modern European and Scandinavian authors,
                        politicians and cultural personalities, written for an international
                        readership.</p>
                    <p>That <em>Emigrant Literature</em> acquired its peculiar fate is also
                        attributable to the fact that the man who led the relentless assault on
                        Danish national self-understanding was himself of a mixed cultural
                        background as an assimilated Danish Jew. The Jewish component of Georg
                        Brandes’ thinking has traditionally played a lesser role in interpretations
                        of <em>Emigrant Literature</em>, even though it is certain that the double
                        identity of the author manifests itself in various ways – in both his
                        cosmopolitan perspective on literary history and his profound empathy for
                        the emigrant experience of homelessness and alienation. This openness to the
                        alien is at the same time a part of what makes Brandes’ method of literary
                        and cultural criticism relevant – and controversial – to this day.</p>

                    <h1 id="background">2. Background and Genesis</h1>
                    <p>In the years prior to <em>Emigrant Literature</em>, Brandes had established
                        himself as the new young hope of the academic and literary scene in Denmark.
                        Already as a student, in 1863, he had received the university’s gold medal
                        for a treatise on the idea of fate in Greek tragedy, and a year later he
                        concluded his MA examinations with a thesis on “The Reciprocal Relation
                        Between the Pathetic and the Symbolic” in Shakespeare’s tragedies and
                        Dante’s <em>Divina Commedia</em>. As suggested by these themes and titles,
                        Brandes was versed in the philosophical tradition of German Idealism, which
                        at that point was prevalent in Danish aesthetics and criticism. According to
                        this orientation, works of poetry were viewed as manifestations of eternally
                        valid abstract ideas and principles of form, and it was the task of the
                        critic to evaluate the work of poetry according to how well it was in
                        agreement with these concepts. After acquiring his MA, Brandes intended to
                        depart from his academic exercises within this tradition with a dissertation
                        on “The Theory of the Comic,” but after some years of study he gave up this
                        plan – because among other reasons he made acquaintance with French
                        philosophy and the literary historian Hippolyte Taine (1828-93). The
                        encounter with Taine resulted in a decisive change of course in Brandes’
                        critical work, and the Frenchman ended up as the subject of his dissertation
                        on <em>French Aesthetics in our Age</em> (1870).</p>
                    <p>From the bird’s eye perspective of the history of literary theory, Brandes’
                        education as critic can thus be viewed as a struggle between
                        idealist-metaphysical aesthetics and Taine’s more cultural-historical and
                        secularly grounded literary criticism. In his chief work, <em>Histoire de la
                            littérature anglaise</em> (3 vols., 1863-6), Taine had identified the
                        principles of a new understanding of literature inspired by positivism,
                        which sought to explain literary phenomena from their historical contexts,
                        the life of the author and the composition of the public. For Taine it was
                        not enough to ascertain that a tragedy was a tragedy and that it lived up to
                        the eternal laws of such; he was more interested in getting to know the
                        human being who stood behind the work, and the culture and civilization that
                        rounded it out. Taine thus accentuated the existence of the human factor in
                        literature, while at the same time asserting that the creative abilities of
                        the human being were conditioned by a series of external cultural,
                        climactic, social, and historical factors. In his introduction to his
                        history of English literature he summarized these as three fundamental
                        forces (“forces primordiales”) of history, “<em>le race, le milieu, le
                            moment</em>” (Taine 1866:XXIII), which can be translated as <em>the
                            nation, the surroundings and the age</em>.”</p>
                    <p>In his dissertation Brandes faithfully subscribed to the principle elements
                        of Taine’s methodology – and thus also the idea and the ideal of the
                        literary critic as a “natural scientist of the soul” (Brandes 1870a:72), who
                        just as much as in natural science should explain the causal relation
                        between the emergence of the work of poetry and the aforementioned
                        fundamental forces – or “main forces,” as they might be designated with a
                        term that points directly forward to the “main currents.” At the same time,
                        however, Brandes also took the opportunity to register some objections
                        against the deterministic and reductive character of his mentor’s
                        explanatory models, which he argued had a tendency to reduce poets and
                        poetical works to a summation of the spirit of an age or of a people. In his
                        criticism of Taine, Brandes found considerable support from another French
                        critic, Charles-Augustin Sainte-Beuve (1804-69), specifically his more
                        personalized psychological and historical form of literary criticism.
                        Sainte-Beuve’s portraits of the French Romantic authors, collected in his
                            <em>Critiques et portraits</em>, thus also functioned as a model for
                        Brandes – thus after completing his dissertation he published a series of
                        his reviews and authorial portraits in a volume entitled <em>Criticism and
                            Portraits</em>.</p>
                    <p>The essence of Brandes’ critique of Taine can be boiled down to a sense that
                        Taine’s theory does not to a sufficient degree contain space for the
                        individual and the creative genius, and thereby not at all for the kind of
                            <em>hero worship</em> that over time became a steadily more prominent
                        component of Brandes’ critical method. But this disagreement also points to
                        a second important difference between Brandes and Taine, regarding their
                        respective conceptions of history itself. Whereas Taine is especially
                        interested in the long, almost unchanging lines of the development of nation
                        and identity, Brandes’ more combative temperament oriented him toward the
                        radical break and renewal in history. If the key words in Taine were nation
                        and civilization, in Brandes they were rupture and revolution.</p>
                    <p>On this point Brandes remained a disciple of G.W.F. Hegel’s dialectical
                        philosophy of history, developed in the German philosopher’s lectures on the
                        subject (<em>Vorlesungen über die Geschichte der Philosophie</em>, 1819-32,
                        published 1833-6). Hegel had imagined world history as a forward moving
                        narrative of progress, in which human reason and freedom gradually manifest
                        in the world through the continual movement of ideas (theses), which
                        encounter their opposites (antitheses) that then are sublated into a higher
                        synthesis. It is this dialectic and scheme of the philosophy of history that
                        forms the foundation of the literary historical drama of <em>Main
                            Currents</em>, which is staged as a struggle between principles of
                        revolution and reaction.</p>
                    <p>Thus we have outlined the theoretical and academic background of <em>Emigrant
                            Literature</em>, but in order to understand the rebellious and
                        provocative form of the lectures, it is necessary to supplement this
                        description with certain biographical factors. After the defense of his
                        dissertation, Brandes departed in April 1870 on a European grand tour that
                        came to last sixteen months, bringing him to France, England, Switzerland,
                        and Italy. The tour was a landmark in Brandes’ development, in that along
                        the way he made the acquaintance of a series of personalities each of which
                        in his own manner came to influence, inspire and stir up the young doctor
                        toward his immense confrontation with Danish national liberal culture in
                        November 1871. Brandes was, as Henning Fenger puts it, “a brilliant
                        traveler,” who by virtue of his social skills and talent for conversation
                        quickly established networks of personal contacts in the places he visited
                        (Fenger 1957:169). Through his expansive, almost daily correspondence with
                        associates back home, which functions like a kind of combined intellectual
                        diary and archive of impressions for his later literary reworking, we can
                        follow his doings during the journey and also locate the first sketches of
                        that which after his return would become <em>Emigrant Literature</em>.</p>
                    <p>The first destination was Paris, in which Brandes was received like a son by
                        the Taine family, but where he was also disappointed by the political
                        conservatism then prominent in French intellectual circles. Also in Paris,
                        Brandes made contact with the elderly literary historian, librarian and
                        professor of English and German at the Collège de France, Philarète Chasles
                        (1798-1873), who enchanted Brandes with his anecdotes and stories of scandal
                        of the French Romantics. But his time with the affable Chasles was also
                        decisive for Brandes in that it turned him on to the idea of viewing the
                        main lines of 19th century French literature as an interplay between the
                        regimes of reason and feeling, between the spirit of Voltaire and the spirit
                        of Rousseau. Thus it was also after a visit with Chasles that Brandes, in a
                        letter to his family dated June 20th, 1870, first committed to paper an
                        outline of a literary historical presentation of “the great currents in
                        recent French literature” (Brandes 1978,I:249), which in raw form contains
                        the fundamental idea and plan for the three “French” volumes of <em>Main
                            Currents</em>.</p>
                    <p>Yet most important for Brandes’ intellectual development was without a doubt
                        his encounter with the English philosopher, economist and liberal politician
                        John Stuart Mill (1806-73), whom Brandes met in Paris and later visited in
                        London in July of 1870. In 1869, Brandes had produced a Danish translation
                        of Mill’s <em>The Subjection of Women</em>, which argued for the
                        emancipation of women and the equality of the sexes, but the personal
                        meeting between the two led to an intense philosophical exchange that pushed
                        Brandes further away from the philosophical schooling of his youth. In a
                        letter of July 16th, 1870, Brandes proclaims that his conversations with
                        Mill amount to “a kind of turning point in my inner intellectual history”
                        (Brandes 1978, I:275). As a thinker Mill was a modern representative of the
                        empiricist tradition in English philosophy and social science, which takes
                        its point of departure in the idea that all knowledge and perception must be
                        built upon observation. On this basis, Mill had developed a modern social
                        and moral philosophy, so-called <em>utilitarianism</em>, which proceeded
                        from the principle that every human action must be evaluated based on its
                        sum usefulness to society – and not according to the degree to which it
                        accorded with preordained principles, whether derived from religion or
                        natural rights. Mill’s utilitarianism was critical to Brandes in that it
                        revealed the foundation of a modern ethics founded not in religious but in
                        worldly principles, but at the same time he was also drawn to the practical
                        and pragmatic dimension of Mill’s philosophy, which brought together liberal
                        ideas of freedom and the social and political reform movements of the
                        age.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately through his conversations with Mill, Brandes came to a third
                        important realization that concerned the surprising ignorance of the various
                        European nations of each other’s cultures and intellectual traditions. Just
                        as he had been surprised in Paris by Taine’s ignorance of Germany, in
                        England he was able to discern Mill’s equally striking lack of knowledge of
                        Hegel’s philosophy. This experience made it clear to Brandes that there was
                        a need for a cosmopolitan mediator between the European traditions and
                        intellectual orientations, e.g. the role he would make his own with <em>Main
                            Currents</em>.</p>
                    <p>At the end of July – just as the Franco-Prussian war broke out – Brandes
                        continued his travels southward over the Alps to Geneva and from there on to
                        Italy. The natural descriptions of the areas around Rousseau’s birthplace
                        and the equally ecstatic descriptions of Italian landscapes, art and
                        architecture that constitute some of the literary highpoints of <em>Emigrant
                            Literature</em> (chapters I and XVI) can be traced to this part of the
                        journey. Brandes’ enthusiasm for Italy was first and foremost the result of
                        his encounter with the architectural and artistic treasures of Florence,
                        Rome, Naples, and Pompey. But his fascination was also possessed of a more
                        concrete political dimension, tied to the modern Italian democratic
                        movements for freedom and independence and to the recent dissolution of the
                        Papal States in central Italy – an event that awakened Brandes’
                        revolutionary instincts.</p>
                    <p>During his stay in Italy, Brandes’ thoughts on these themes were stimulated
                        by his acquaintance and interaction with two quite distinctive
                        personalities: the law professor and later politician Giuseppe Saredo
                        (1832-1902) of Rome, ten years his elder, and the 24-year-old French art
                        connoisseur and aesthete Georges Noufflard (1846-1897).</p>
                    <p>Saredo was an impassioned patriot, a supporter of the young independent Italy
                        and a dedicated advocate of J.S. Mill’s philosophical and political thought.
                        When, in November of 1870, Brandes was taken with a typhus infection, which
                        nearly cost him his life and consequently confined him to four months of
                        bedrest, it was Saredo who was his daily conversation partner through the
                        winter, helping to keeping his nose to the grindstone with hours long
                        exegeses on liberal progress in the modern world.</p>
                    <p>Noufflard was Saredo’s diametrical opposite; a distinguished aesthete who
                        settled in Rome in 1871 to begin studies for a never realized book on the
                        monuments and artworks of the city. Brandes and Noufflard met at the
                        Scandinavian Club in Rome at the beginning of April 1871, just as Brandes
                        had risen from the sickbed, and the two spent a few intense months together,
                        with excursions to art museums and churches in Rome, Sorrento and Naples
                        that became decisive in the development of his understanding of art.</p>
                    <p>If it was Noufflard who taught Brandes something important about the
                        aesthetic perception of art, then it could be said that it was Saredo who
                        taught Brandes to politicize and to polemicize art. For Saredo the future of
                        Italy and Europe was to be determined by politics, and to the degree he was
                        interested in aesthetic questions, he was in the pattern of Mill in favor of
                        a firm utilitarian point of view, which both provoked and incited Brandes
                        the aesthete:</p>
                    <blockquote>He endorses and adores all tendentiousness. He says: for you a book
                        is a work, or rather a work of art; for me it is an act. The idea of
                        literary immortality no longer has any meaning, a book only sticks around
                        until a better one comes along, no measure of artistic perfection will save
                        it from being swallowed up by what comes after. Let it be an act, a weapon.
                        In all worthy books there is a hidden polemic, and it is the polemic that
                        makes them worthy. (Brandes 1978, II:182-3) </blockquote>
                    <p>That Brandes in 1873, in the afterword to <em>The Romantic School in
                            Germany</em>, could summarize his understanding of the literary work as
                        an act points directly back to Saredo, and it is tempting to see the Italian
                        ideologue as the last stop on the process of intellectual radicalization
                        that was his European <em>Bildungsreise</em>. In summarizing the various
                        impulses Brandes absorbed during the journey, it can be said that they had
                        more to do with his <em>Weltanschauung</em> and “the education of the heart”
                        than with academic learning. “I cannot take pride in a direct scientific
                        output,” he confesses in a May 23rd, 1871 letter to his academic mentor, the
                        philosophy professor Hans Brøchner (Brandes, Georg and Edvard 1939-42,
                        I:148). But his encounter with Italian art and folk culture, which for
                        Brandes amounted to a continuation of the heathen and natural ideal of
                        humanity of antiquity, had in combination with Saredo’s political reform
                        ideas implanted a rebellious and anti-clerical attitude in the young doctor,
                        which came to expression in the famous and oft-cited letter to his family
                        written upon his departure from Italy on July 9th, 1871:</p>
                    <blockquote>What is generally not expressed too loudly, I express here: the
                        liveliest hatred of Christianity; from my very heart I shall always strike
                        up Voltaire’s “Écrasons l’infâme.” I hate Christianity in my gut and in my
                        bones. (Brandes 1978, II:431).</blockquote>
                    <p>The grand tour was brought to an end in July of 1871, as Brandes was to
                        return home and find his place within the society and culture that, because
                        of his impressions of Italy, he found utterly barren, hostile to art and
                        humanity. After his return and in consultation with Brøchner, he planned the
                        series of lectures that was meant to position him for the soon to be vacant
                        professorship in aesthetics at Copenhagen University. Brandes initially
                        thought that the lecture series should concern modern French drama – a theme
                        he knew thoroughly and on which he could have lectured without problems. Yet
                        here a second surprising and fateful incident took place in Brandes’
                        intellectual biography, for it was actually Brøchner who recommended that
                        Brandes embark on the grand project of six related series of lectures on the
                        three major European literatures of the first half of the 19th century
                        (Fenger 1957:211-12). It was also on Brøchner’s recommendation that the
                        project was titled “Main Currents.”</p>

                    <div>
                        <h2>a. An Expedited Work</h2>
                        <p>When evaluating the result of his labors, <em>Emigrant Literature</em>
                            (1872), it must first be kept in mind that the work process itself was
                            expedited. And when we account for how little Brandes knew about the
                            literature that should constitute the theme of the first lecture series,
                            its choice can perhaps best be described as a hazardous experiment. The
                            aspiring professor’s knowledge of early 19th century French so-called
                            emigrant literature was in reality limited to a quite small handful of
                            books, the majority of which he knew only second hand or in any case did
                            not have time to reread before the twelve lectures that were delivered
                            twice weekly between November 3rd and December 16th, 1871.</p>
                        <p>As a kind of literary and intellectual historical prologue to the theme,
                            Brandes treated J.J. Rousseau’s epistolary novel <em>Julie ou La
                                Nouvelle Héloïse</em> (1761) and Goethe’s debut novel <em>Die Leiden
                                jungen Werthers</em> (1774). Thereafter the literature of the French
                            émigrés is illuminated by reducing it to five works: Chateaubriand’s
                            little autobiographical novel <em>René</em> (1802), Senancour’s related
                            hermetic novel <em>Obermann</em> (1804), Constant’s love novel
                                <em>Adolphe</em> (1816), and two novels of Madame de Staël,
                                <em>Delphine</em> (1802) and <em>Corinne ou l’Italie</em> (1807). As
                            laconically noted by Henning Fenger, this was “by no means an impressive
                            list for a seeker of a university chair in the scientific study of
                            poetic art” (Fenger 1955:390). Added to this is the fact that time did
                            not at all permit Brandes to conduct a deeper or independent reading of
                            the five works, which is why his characterizations rely heavily on
                            observations from other, namely Sainte-Beuve’s, literary portraits of
                            the French Romantics.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h2>b. A Hegelian Drama</h2>
                        <p>But Brandes compensated for his lack of knowledge of his theme through
                            his grandiose oratorical framing of the project. The introductory
                            lecture itself is a rhetorical demonstration of power – a hybrid of
                            political manifesto and theatrical stage setting that demanded attention
                            not only because of its impertinent and flagrantly unnuanced attack on
                            Danish Romanticism and Golden Age literature, but also because of its
                            self-confident presentation of the revolutionary main current in 19th
                            century European literature as an inescapably Hegelian process that
                            sooner or later would reach and overwhelm the sleepy little peripheral
                            nation. Without a quiver in his voice, Brandes cast his plan for the
                            coming six lecture series as a “grand drama” in six acts (Brandes
                            1872a:12-13) about the realization of human freethinking and its
                            ultimate triumph in history – with 1848, the year of revolutions, as the
                            historical turning point.</p>
                        <p>The introductory lecture, like <em>Emigrant Literature</em> as a whole,
                            is speckled with pregnant images and emphatic assertions – such as for
                            example Brandes’ comparison of Danish literature to a small chapel in a
                            grand church that has its main alter elsewhere (Brandes 1872a:10), or
                            his employment of Aesop’s fable of the fox and the stork, who
                            respectively serve each other delicacies on a flat plate and in a tall,
                            narrow-necked vase (Brandes 1872a:8-9), as an image of the lack of
                            communication between European literatures and thus the need for the
                            comparative approach that constitutes the literary critical program of
                            the lectures.</p>
                        <p>The starting point for this is the Taine-inspired view of literature as a
                            historical-psychological document: “when a people’s literature is fully
                            developed, it represents the entire history of that population’s
                            thoughts and feelings” (Brandes 1872a:9). Thus Brandes introduces his
                            task in <em>Emigrant Literature</em> as an investigation of the
                            historical types in literature that incarnate the great intellectual and
                            literary historical epochal change from Voltaire and the rational
                            philosophy of the Enlightenment toward the breakthrough of feeling and
                            passion in Rousseau and his descendants in European Early Romanticism.
                            “What I seek to portray for you is the spiritual state, at once powerful
                            yet unhealthy, the peculiar upsurge and the peculiar sickness of soul
                            that characterized the beginning of our century” (Brandes 1872a:74).</p>
                        <p>The main event or the Hegelian “action” that sets in motion this
                            development is the “great revolution in the human spirit” (Brandes
                            1872a:74), which Brandes views as a two-pronged movement: “the
                            individual is emancipated . . . and thought is liberated” (Brandes
                            1872a:74, 76). Brandes conceives of the revolution as the psychological
                            and emotional process that came into being as the human being freed
                            himself from traditional societal authorities and seized the power that
                            previously had been the preserve of gods and kings. Yet in the same
                            manner that the French Revolution resulted first in the Terror and then
                            in the reconsolidation of the empire, the emancipation of the individual
                            led to new sicknesses of soul and anomalies. The individual asserted
                            himself and the right to freethinking, yet the new sense of possibility
                            and consciousness of the self was not coupled with a corresponding
                            power, such that the result became disappointment, melancholy and – in
                            the most extreme cases like Werther – suicide.</p>
                        <p>Yet the fact that it is Werther who functions as the first figure in the
                            literary and intellectual historical typology renders it clear that the
                            revolution and the emancipation under discussion relate not so much to
                            revolution as a social, political and historical phenomenon. It is the
                            emotional aspects of the revolution and the modernization of European
                            society during this period that interests Brandes. The story of
                            Werther’s unhappy love for Lotte is in his view not just the story of
                            the passion of one individual, but the expression of “the passions,
                            longings and agonies of a whole epoch,” more explicitly of “the
                            misrelation between the infinity of the heart and the strictures of
                            society” (Brandes 1872a:51, 55).</p>
                        <p>In order to analyze this problematic, Brandes relies on a typology of
                            figures from 19th century French emigrant literature. In the first place
                            this involves disillusioned young men such as Chateaubriand’s René,
                            Senancour’s Obermann and Constant’s Adolphe, who as disciples of
                            Rousseau and Werther are governed by an excess of dreams, feelings and
                            passions that cannot be realized, which is why they must take flight
                            from the demands of society – out in nature, away from civilization or
                            completely outside this world. In the second place this involves a
                            series of modern and otherwise vigorous female figures in the form of
                            Constant’s Eleonore and Madame de Staël’s Corinne. The story of
                            emancipation that unfolds in <em>Emigrant Literature</em>, in other
                            words, also concerns gender. The French Revolution and the human
                            conception of freedom constitute the overarching historical frame of
                            investigation, but an important secondary motif is the emancipation of
                            women in intellectual and literary history.</p>

                        <h2>c. A Love Story</h2>
                        <p>Thus we are at the same time on the track of the story that constitutes
                            the almost melodramatic plot of the lecture series. As scrupulous as
                                <em>Main Currents</em> is as a whole, <em>Emigrant Literature</em>
                            is also constructed as a drama with a reversal at the midpoint of the
                            story. And just as Brandes in the introductory lecture could point to
                            the hero of freedom Lord Byron as “the one man [who] brings about the
                            reversal in the great drama” (Brandes 1872a:13), so is <em>Emigrant
                                Literature</em> equipped with a hero, here in the form of a heroine,
                            namely Madame de Staël. De Staël appears here in the role of the author
                            who through her modern female figures and her own life example brings
                            forth the epochal change in French and European literature, by
                            introducing a new perspective on love as passion and marriage as social
                            institution.</p>
                        <p>The reversal in <em>Emigrant Literature</em> is heralded by the long and
                            detailed treatment of Benjamin Constant’s autobiographical novella
                                <em>Adolphe</em> (chapters 8-10), based on the unequal and unhappy
                            love relation between the author and Madame de Staël. For Brandes,
                                <em>Adolphe</em> constitutes a revolutionary experiment and new
                            departure in conceptions of love and passion by virtue of its
                            unconventional staging of a love story between a young man and a mature,
                            married woman. Brandes’ reading focuses on the female main character
                            Eleonore, who sacrifices everything in the novel – her home, fortune and
                            bourgeois standing – in favor of her impassioned yet impossible love for
                            Adolphe.</p>
                        <p>What is especially interesting to Brandes is the historical novelty and
                            norm-defying elements of this arrangement. Whereas the traditional
                            portrayal of love relationships in literature presumed the man to be
                            older than the woman, in that the portrayal of the women was tied to the
                            portrayal of the young girl who was herself the incarnation of innocence
                            and chastity, Constant’s experiment proceeds from a new, natural
                            scientific understanding of woman as complex, as a “mixed composition”
                            of variegated feelings and passions (Brandes 1872a:98-9).</p>
                        <p>What Brandes finds to be so historically groundbreaking and so profoundly
                            intriguing about <em>Adolphe</em> is that the novel describes a fleeting
                            and out of wedlock love relationship with passion as its driving force
                            and with the woman as the active instigator. In this reversal of the
                            traditional assignment of roles between the sexes itself, he sees a
                            critical and revolutionary potential that opens up a new mode of
                            thinking about love and passion – outside of bourgeois conventions and
                            free of the traditional literary understanding of womanhood as the
                            incarnation of virtue and innocence.</p>
                        <p>By staging this non-traditional love story, <em>Adolphe</em>, in Brandes’
                            view, does not just open up a new and more objective understanding of
                            the complex psychology of love. The novel was at the same time epochal
                            in that it anticipated a new type in literature: the mature and
                            experienced women – “the women of thirty” (“la femme de trente ans”),
                            who is first mentioned in Balzac’s novel of the same name, written
                            between 1829 and 1842. But it was equally important that the novel
                            appealed to Brandes’ taste for gossip and personal stories, in so far as
                            the fascinating modern female type of Eleonore was based on a real model
                            in the form of Madame de Staël, “that woman who fought the greatest
                            battle ever fought by a woman in all world history using purely
                            intellectual weapons” (Brandes 1872a:125).</p>

                        <h2>d. Madame de Staël</h2>
                        <p>The analysis of <em>Adolphe</em> serves as the bridge to the ensuing
                            lectures, which are devoted to the heroine de Staël. First Brandes
                            offers a focused discussion of the epistolary novel Delphine (1801),
                            which continues the theme of <em>Adolphe</em> by addressing the
                            contradiction between the individual and society and between passionate
                            love and marriage as an institution. The novel concerns two lovers,
                            Delphine and Léonce, who cannot be together because the latter has been
                            tricked into an unhappy and disharmonious marriage with another (of a
                            wholly alien nature) woman, and because the law in a Catholic country
                            like the France in which the novel is set forbids divorce. The book,
                            which was published a year before the later Emperor Napoleon entered
                            into the Concordant with the Pope in Rome, can be read as an attack on
                            indissoluble marriage as a religiously and juridically founded social
                            institution – a theme that fits Brandes’ emancipatory agenda like a
                            glove. But the novel furthermore provides Brandes with the occasion to
                            insert a longer excursus on the status of marriage in the northern
                            European and Protestant societies in which divorce was not forbidden by
                            law but where, according to Brandes, societal morality, public opinion
                            and fear of judgement functions as a guarantee of the inviolability of
                            marriage.</p>
                        <p>It is within this context that Brandes flings his famous grenade in the
                            form of his Taine-inspired analysis of the Danish and Nordic concept of
                            “the home” and its implicit ideal of women as creatures of it. This
                            moral doctrine, he argues, can be traced back to “one singular, cruelly
                            simple, cruelly base climactic necessity,” namely the frigid Nordic
                            climate and “the necessity of artificial heating” (Brandes 1872a:151).
                            Thus the newly returned Italian tourist plays his trump card: “without
                            artificial heating, in the full magnificence of sunlight, all the
                            beautiful ideals, duties and virtues reveal themselves to be – not
                            untrue but relative” (Ibid). This bold statement constituted one of the
                            provocative incendiaries in the lecture series and was one of the
                            reasons why it gave so much offense when the book came out in 1872,
                            which is also why in later editions Brandes chose to remove it.</p>
                        <p>The excursus on the home within the lecture, however, also functions as a
                            part of the argumentation for and demonstration of Brandes’ grand idea,
                            that the comparative view of literature as a manner of reading can lead
                            to national self-critique and to emancipation from national prejudices.
                            This theme is at the same time at the center of the following lecture,
                            which concerns Madame de Staël in her role as critic and cosmopolitan
                            mediator between European cultures – an effort that manifests itself
                            especially in her main work <em>De l’Allemagne</em> (<em>On
                            Germany</em>, 1810, published in London in 1813). In this book de Staël
                            made the case for the bold point of view that France could learn from
                            the recent literary renewal in Germany. While French literature and
                            intellectual life had according to de Staël hardened into barren
                            rationalist philosophy and classicist enslavement to rules, she saw in
                            soulful German “Sturm-und-Drang” poetry and the idealist philosophy of
                            Immanuel Kant a more fruitful model for literary renewal. In Paris,
                            however, de Staël’s effort to import the spirit of German Romanticism
                            was viewed as an attack on the hegemony of French literature in Europe,
                            and the book called down the wrath and the censorship of Napoleon, the
                            very reason why its author had to go into exile at the family château,
                            Coppet, located by Lake Geneva in Switzerland. Brandes here compares de
                            Staël’s role as critical exile author with Voltaire’s struggle for
                            freedom and tolerance from exile in Ferney during the previous
                            century.</p>
                        <p>There is also an element of self-identification on the part of Brandes in
                            the profoundly sympathetic and valorizing description of de Staël as
                            critic and cosmopolitan exile author. In a variation of the basic
                            formula of his reading of <em>Delphine</em>, he summarizes her efforts
                            as “rendering the national poetry of the French relative to the nation”
                            (Brandes 1872a:167-8) – in other words, the same operation Brandes had
                            taken on himself with respect to the relation between Danish literature
                            and national identity.</p>

                        <h2>e.<em>Corinne ou l’Italie</em> – or the Conquest of the Autonomy of
                            Art</h2>
                        <p>The high point of <em>Emigrant Literature</em> is Brandes’ gripping
                            commentary on de Staël’s novel Corinne ou l’Italie (1807). Again the
                            starting point is a love novel about to two lovers who cannot be
                            together, because moral and cultural norms raise obstacles between them.
                            It is the story of the young poetess Corinne, a modern type of mixed
                            nationality, half Italian and half English. She loves the young
                            Englishman Oswald, and this love is reciprocated, but in the end the
                            connection cannot come to anything, because Oswald cannot fit the
                            independent and impassioned Italian into his image of womanhood. Brandes
                            calls <em>Corinne</em> “a poem on national prejudices” (Brandes
                            1872a:199), first and foremost here Oswald’s protestant sexual morality
                            and patriarchal view of womanhood. But Oswald’s attitude to life also
                            reveals itself in another manner that acquires a decisive significance
                            in the novel, namely his total lack of receptiveness to art and the role
                            of the aesthetic in existence, which makes him unable to understand
                            Corinne. </p>
                        <p>The novel takes place in Rome, where Corinne tries in vain to open
                            Oswald’s eyes to the joys of the senses and the aesthetic experience of
                            art. Brandes’ reading of the novel proceeds like a pleasure walk around
                            the cultural and architectural sites of the city, which he supplements
                            with memories of his own Italian travels. The lecture is not only
                            noteworthy for its personal and subjective quality, but also and perhaps
                            especially by virtue of its surprising embrace and celebration of “the
                            liberal relationship between Catholicism and art” (Brandes 1872a:219),
                            which Brandes sees manifested in Italian Renaissance art and
                            architecture. With this inclination toward Catholicism, Brandes almost
                            seems to set aside his anti-clerical agenda in the service of a higher
                            cause. But of what cause?</p>
                        <p>For Brandes, the great artistic and architectural works of the Italian
                            Renaissance such as Michelangelo’s frescoes in the Sistine Chapel and
                            St. Peter’s Church in Rome and St. Mark’s Basilica in Venice, are
                            monuments to an aesthetic sensibility and emancipated humanity that
                            constitute a total contrast to Nordic asceticism, which is inherently
                            hostile to art. Yet at the same time he attempts to argue for a
                            connection or a historical parallel between the 15th and 16th century
                            Italian Renaissance and German Romanticism at the dawn of the 19th
                            century, which turned away from the strict faith in reason of the
                            Enlightenment and once again reoriented itself toward Catholicism. In de
                            Staël’s novel it is Corinne who promotes this Catholic orientation for
                            its generosity, moral tolerance and aesthetic liberality. Brandes sees
                            this openness to the aesthetic culture of Catholicism as an expression
                            of the influences on de Staël of the brothers Schlegel and of Immanuel
                            Kant’s aesthetics, which conceived of art as an independent and
                            self-contained domain of human cognition that should not be subordinated
                            to moral or social demands. His reading of <em>Corinne</em> thus at the
                            same time develops into an object lesson in the aesthetic observation of
                            art.</p>
                        <p>In the novel, de Staël has Oswald express moral outrage over the physical
                            nakedness and sensuality in Michelangelo’s images of god and the
                            prophets in the Sistine Chapel, just as it incenses the protestant
                            northerner that the Italian Renaissance artists could attempt to adorn
                            Christian buildings with figures from the heathen pantheon of antiquity.
                            Yet Brandes sees a significant sign of the dawning of modernity
                            precisely in the free painterly treatment of religious motifs and the
                            liberal intercourse with different pictorial traditions. At another
                            place in the novel Corinne leads Oswald into the Colosseum, in which the
                            moralistic Englishman can feel nothing other than indignation at the
                            thought of all the Christian blood that has been spilled upon the place.
                            This scene is also construed by Brandes as an example of how
                            Protestantism lacks a sensibility for art. He paraphrases Kant’s
                            division of human cognition into three separate spheres or domains, the
                            practical-moral, the theoretical and the aesthetic, and can thus
                            conclude that Oswald is a man who lacks an aesthetic disposition: “he
                            has no eyes, his reason and his morality has deprived his senses of
                            vitality. Thus he cannot manage to forget content in favor of form”
                            (Brandes 1872a:209).</p>
                        <p>The forgetting of content in favor of form becomes in this manner the
                            surprising farewell salute of <em>Emigrant Literature</em> – surprising
                            not the least in light of the opening lecture’s demand to submit content
                            and “problems” to debate. Brandes’ enthusiasm for the aesthetic culture
                            of Catholicism can be seen as a facet of his revolt against the
                            Protestantism of his homeland, which had been nourished by the
                            impressions gathered from his stay in Italy. Even the idol of Brandes’
                            youth, Søren Kierkegaard, must now account for his lack of “artistic
                            cultivation” (Brandes 1872a:212). Yet the aesthetic disposition and the
                            ability to evaluate art as art becomes for Brandes at the same time a
                            litmus test of modernity. When at the end he shall illustrate his idea
                            of Catholic liberality in relation to art, he relies on his own
                            observations of St. Mark’s Basilica in Venice, which is depicted as a
                            veritable bombardment of the senses, a “painterly” architecture in
                            colored marble and gilded ornaments. Playing his trump card by
                            emphasizing the point about how artistic form has here freed itself from
                            religious content and the function of the building, he compares the
                            church to a woman of a harem, “a lovely, harem beauty in repose, heavily
                            loaded with gold, pearls and shimmering diamonds, with the richest
                            brocade covering her Moorish sofa” (Brandes 1872a:221). And he finds
                            support for this interpretation by citing from the Church’s Latin
                            inscription, in which according to Brandes the two architects, Francisco
                            and Valerio Zuccato, challenge us to view the church as a work of
                            art.</p>
                        <p>Quite surprisingly, <em>Emigrant Literature</em> thus concludes as an
                            apologia for the autonomy of art and for the aesthetic legacy of German
                            Early Romanticism. It amounts to an impassioned defense of a kind of
                            “l’art pour l’art” (Brandes 1872a210) that Brandes believes to have
                            located in the artistic freedom from religious dogma characteristic of
                            Catholic Renaissance art, and which he saw as reemerging on the doorstep
                            of the 19th century in the insistence of Kant and the German Early
                            Romantics of the Athenaeum circle that art and aesthetic taste
                            constitute a distinct domain of human cognition, with its own peculiar
                            laws.</p>
                        <p>In the big picture it is worth dwelling on the overwhelmingly positive
                            view of Romanticism that marks <em>Emigrant Literature</em> and that
                            stands in stark contrast to the perspective of the following volumes of
                                <em>Main Currents</em>, which adopt a much more combative attitude
                            toward Romanticism in its later manifestations in Germany and France.
                            The literature of the French émigrés was for Brandes the “healthy” part
                            of the reaction to the 18th century, “a form of Romanticism before
                            Romanticism” (Brandes 1872a:227), e.g. before Romanticism subjected
                            itself to the old authorities in the form of the church and the monarchy
                            and before it devolved into hegemonic schools in the various national
                            vintages.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h2>f. Comparatism and the Meeting of Cultures</h2>
                        <p><em>Emigrant Literature</em> thus interprets Early Romanticism as a
                            cosmopolitan enterprise – a blended European culture that emerged from
                            the meeting of peoples, nationalities and cultures after the French
                            Revolution. Employing a concept from late 20th century postcolonial
                            literary criticism, it can be said that Brandes emphasizes the inherent
                            “hybridity” of the cultural poetics of Romanticism, which comes to
                            expression in the paradox that in France it was viewed as too German and
                            in Germany it was seen overly “French.” It is according to this
                            perspective that Madame de Staël, the cosmopolite and the first lady of
                            the revolution’s intellectuals, can be assigned the role of the great
                            literary historical mediator and reformer, whose historical mission was
                            to foster a dialogue and synthesis between the apparently irreconcilable
                            European cultural and intellectual traditions – between South and North,
                            between Catholicism and Protestantism and between the 18th century faith
                            in reason and the new aesthetic sensibility of the 19th century. </p>
                        <p>To render national poetics relative to the nation. Brandes summarizes the
                            impact of de Staël with a formulation that could in reality be applied
                            to his own project. With his comparative view of literature and his
                            insistence on treating the major European literatures as a complex
                            whole, Brandes thereby made a pioneering contribution to the
                            establishment of modern comparative literary studies, which in the
                            following decades would develop into an autonomous discipline with its
                            own journals, professorships and scientific standards – free of the
                            national philologies that had contributed to the emergence of 19th
                            century European national states. Yet when Brandes is referred to as the
                            “père du comparatisme” (Madsen 2004:65), it is also important to keep in
                            mind a critical difference between his methodology and that of later
                            comparativists. The form of comparative literature that would be
                            practiced and institutionalized as an academic discipline in the
                            following decades was first and foremost a method of investigating and
                            demonstrating influences between European literatures – a mode of
                            perceiving that plays no role in Brandes, for whom the comparative
                            perspective always serves a different purpose. Lars Peter Rømhild has
                            summarized the distinction in this manner: “He [Brandes] made
                            comparisons to stimulate thinking and sometimes to <em>produce</em>
                            influences, but in most cases not to show former influences and explain
                            them genetically” (Rømhild 1980:286).</p>
                        <p>In other words, Brandes’ comparatism was subordinated to his essentially
                            extrinsic approach to literary criticism, to his interest in literary
                            texts as psychological documents of the thoughts and feelings of
                            changing epochs. Toward the end of <em>Emigrant Literature</em> he
                            summarizes his programmatic point of view with a polemical address
                            directed at the Hegelian conception of aesthetics: “it was believed that
                            poetic forms and works of poetry grew out of each other like the
                            branches of a tree, instead of studying their connection to culture, to
                            the whole of life” (Brandes 1872a:269). Brandes’ conception of the
                            comparative view of literature was possessed of a vision that literature
                            and literary criticism could function as a kind of medium for cultural
                            diplomacy and for the exchange of ideas between peoples and nations. But
                            as we shall see, the focus of the reception of the work by the Danish
                            public in 1872 was not on that of a peaceful and reconciliatory message.
                            On the contrary, it was the most polemical, most negative and most
                            combative aspects of Brandes’ gambit that the Danish public would seize
                            upon.</p>

                        <h2>a. Contemporary Reception</h2>
                        <p>The twelve public lectures in November and December 1871 became a hot
                            ticket that filled up the auditorium of Copenhagen University, making
                            Brandes the leading subject of conversation around the city. In a
                            November 17th letter to Georges Noufflard he is able to report
                            triumphantly on the tumultuous scenes at the fourth lecture, at which
                            nearly 400 people – according to Brandes around 150 of them women – had
                            to press themselves in close, many finding a place on the stairs or in
                            the snow on Vor Frue Plads outside the auditorium during the waiting
                            period before they were allowed inside (Brandes 1952:39). Rumors swirled
                            in the press about the young rebel who from his perch at the university
                            lectern launched his volcanic attacks on the social order, the nation,
                            Christianity, and marriage.</p>
                        <p>As Brandes rather more humbly writes in the brief foreword to the first
                            edition of <em>Emigrant Literature</em>, it was in order to avoid “the
                            misunderstandings, distortions and exaggerations” (Brandes 1872a:5) then
                            in circulation that he chose to publish the lectures. But if he had
                            desired to dampen the mood and thus put a lid on the scandal by
                            publishing them, he had to think again. The publication of the lectures
                            instead became a media event that mobilized the tone-setting segment of
                            the Danish intelligentsia to engage in a purposeful campaign against
                            Brandes, who was subjected to charges of indecency, unscientific
                            practice and socialism. The campaign destroyed his chances of
                            appointment to the expected professorship in aesthetics and further
                            resulted in a years-long virtual <em>Berufsverbot</em> in a majority of
                            Copenhagen newspapers and journals, in which he had previously earned a
                            living as literary critic and theater reviewer.</p>
                        <p>As Beth Juncker has demonstrated, the critique of and debates about
                                <em>Emigrant Literature</em> can be categorized into three
                            internally related themes: the literary, the moral-religious and the
                            social (Juncker 1980). The first concerned <em>Emigrant Literature</em>
                            as a work of scholarship, e.g. the scientific quality (or lack thereof)
                            of Brandes’ methodology. The moral-religious critique took up Brandes’
                            atheism and agitation for “freethinking” as well as his rejection of
                            Christianity as the ultimate authority of existence. The social critique
                            concerned especially the socially destructive element in Brandes’
                            program as well as its affinities to contemporary socialism.</p>
                        <p>That a literary treatise by a liberal freethinker such as Brandes could
                            at all be likened to socialism says a little about the nervous and
                            perplexed attitude predominate in Denmark in the aftermath of the Paris
                            Commune of May 1871. In the summer of 1871, Copenhagen had witnessed its
                            first tender suggestion of socialism with Louis Pio’s founding of
                            Denmark’s first worker’s newspaper, <em>Socialisten</em>, and with the
                            organization of the country’s first strike, on the Burmeister &amp; Wain
                            shipyard in September. Fate would also have it that the Danish chapter
                            of the First International would come into being only the month before
                            Brandes began his lecture series. The proximity of these events explains
                            why socialism became the political context in which <em>Emigrant
                                Literature</em> was read – though the deliberate efforts of Brandes’
                            opponents to lead the public astray should not be underestimated.</p>
                        <p>The campaign was led by the two national liberal newspapers,
                                <em>Fædrelandet</em> and <em>Dagbladet</em>, as well as by the
                            Grundtvigian organ <em>Hejmdal</em>. <em>Fædrelandet</em>, the flagship
                            of national liberalism, devoted no less than nine long articles (of
                            which seven were on the front page) to the matter, while
                                <em>Hejmdal</em> issued a series of five front page articles,
                            indicating the seriousness of the Brandes “problem.”</p>
                        <p>The first reaction came from <em>Fædrelandet</em>, and it is conspicuous
                            that the national liberal camp viewed Brandes as a turncoat who had gone
                            to war with the national liberal education that had fostered him. It is
                            likewise clear that the debate over Emigrant Literature was to a high
                            degree a political debate, which is also evident in the fact that two of
                            the most articulate voices of the critique belonged to two of the
                            period’s highest-profile national liberal politicians and personalities,
                            the poet and <em>Fædrelandet</em> editor Carl Ploug (1813-94) and the
                            theologian, Bishop D.G. Monrad (1811-87), who as Council President in
                            1863 and 1864 had borne the chief responsibility for Danish politics
                            during the war of 1864.</p>
                        <p>Carl Ploug set the tone in a February 17th editorial in which he
                            discussed Brandes as an “ill-mannered fool” and as a “petroleuse” – the
                            term employed during the Paris Commune for the female terrorists who
                            used petroleum as a means of setting fires. The accusation that Brandes
                            was in league with socialism came in the form of the following chain of
                            associations: first Ploug took exception to Brandes’ imprudent
                            discussion of suicide (in the case of Senancourt’s <em>Obermann</em>) as
                            the ultimate form of the emancipation of the self from Christian ethics;
                            then he turned on Brandes’ irreverent dissection of the concept of
                            “home,” which he saw as disdainful of family life and thereby of one of
                            the loadbearing pillars of the national liberal cultural synthesis.
                            Hereafter Ploug discusses Brandes’ recurring figure of the individual’s
                            struggle against society, which he asserted acquires a peculiar meaning
                            when it is proclaimed “in cold blood” from the university lectern “to a
                            mass of impressionable and easily roused young people” and “at a point
                            in time when disruptive forces had begun to stir.” It is clear from this
                            that it was the timing itself of Brandes’ lectures that made them
                            controversial. The fact itself that a group, especially of young people,
                            had been gathered to hear a series of lectures with the character of an
                            agitation was enough to associate Brandes with socialism. Ploug
                            concluded his intervention by calling the young firebrand to order with
                            a reminder of his Jewish ancestry, challenging him to proceed with
                            greater gratitude toward “the society that had provided his forefathers
                            with hospitable shelter.”</p>
                        <p>Brandes attempted to respond to Ploug’s accusations and anti-Semitic
                            attack on his right to express himself, but was now subjected to the
                            bitter experience that the newspapers and journals in which he had
                            earlier published his literary criticism and theater reviews were now
                            closed to him, such that it was necessary for him to publish his
                            response to Ploug as a paid insert in <em>Dagbladet</em> (Feb 22). In
                            the meantime, <em>Fædrelandet</em> continued its campaign, as the author
                            and critic Rudolf Schmidt raked him over the coals in two front page
                            articles (Mar 9 &amp; 11), which criticized his subjectivity and lack of
                            scholarly originality as well as, once again, repeating the accusations
                            of socialism. “Behind Hr. Brandes’ showcasing of aesthetic bric-a-brac,”
                            concludes Schmidt, “there lurks a fundamental dismay with societal
                            organization as a whole, a fanatical desire to reorder it from the
                            ground up” (<em>Fædrelandet</em> Mar 11).</p>
                        <p>Another important point of attack in the national liberal critique was
                            Brandes’ critical methodology itself, which consisted of asserting that
                                <em>Emigrant Literature</em> was neither aesthetics nor science, but
                            on the contrary agitation – “a socially tendentious intervention.” The
                            critic Peter Hansen registered this objection in his <em>Dagbladet</em>
                            review (Mar 27), and D.G. Monrad repeated it in a series of articles on
                            “Freethinking and Dr. Georg Brandes’ Lectures” (<em>Fædrelandet</em>
                            April 4-6). Monrad rejects Brandes’ call for a literature that debates
                            social problems by virtue of a principle of the autonomy of art:
                            “naturally art has its own problems, but they are purely artistic”
                                (<em>Fædrelandet</em> Apr 4). Like Peter Hansen and Rudolf Schmidt
                            he calls for aesthetic evaluations of the works treated by Brandes. In
                            other words, <em>Emigrant Literature</em> is evaluated according to the
                            speculative Hegelian aesthetics Brandes had abandoned in favor of
                            Taine’s positivism.</p>
                        <p>The Grundtvigian opposition to Brandes was registered by the author and
                            lawyer Carl Rosenberg, who in a series of articles entitled
                            “’Freethinking’ and Danish Intellectual Life in the 19th Century”
                                (<em>Hejmdal</em> Mar 11-15) responded to Brandes’ assertion of the
                            decline of Danish literature. This was not the case, argued Rosenberg,
                            who instead set himself to showing how Danish literature in the 19th
                            century had experienced a productive period of flourishing on the basis
                            of the Grundtvigian trinity of the Nordic, the popular and the
                            Christian. Danish literature had no need of seeking “foreign”
                            nourishment from Europe. For the same reason Rosenberg found it not at
                            all necessary to provide a closer description of the theme of
                                <em>Emigrant Literature</em>, “the insane asylum into which the
                            author leads us” (<em>Hejmdal</em> Mar 11).</p>
                        <p>Den nationalliberale-grundtvigianske koalition mod Brandes blotlagde på
                            den måde en vis xenofobi i datidens danske kulturelite, som Brandes også
                            sidenhen i sin karriere skulle få at føle. Henry J. Gibbons har
                            opsummeret elementerne i den nationale modstand mod Brandes på følgende
                            måde: ”Brandesianism was Jewish, <em>udansk</em>, foreign, European,
                            Asiatic, oriental, or – perhaps worst of all – French.” (Gibbons
                            1980:64). Mest direkte kom den antisemitiske tendens til syne i den
                            nationalliberale kritik, hos Ploug og Rudolf Schmidt, som ikke vidste
                            pænere at sige om Brandes’ veltalenhed og stilistiske brillans som
                            skribent, end at denne egenskab ”snarest er at betragte som en Arvelod,
                            der overalt følger den semitiske Stamme” (Fædrelandet 9.3.1872). I en
                            anonymt udgivet pjece om <em>Den ny sensualistiske Lære og Dr.
                                Brandes</em> mente Dr. Schleisner tilsvarende, at Brandes’ æstetiske
                            vurderinger ubevidst bar med sig et ”Stænk af Orientalisme” (Schleisner
                            1872:16), som gjorde ham ude af stand til at forstå den nationale danske
                            kunst og litteratur.</p>
                        <p>By more or less vulgar means the campaign against <em>Emigrant
                                Literature</em> thus managed to create an image of Brandes as
                            persona non grata, an enemy of established society who for the same
                            reason was unsuited to hold an office as a servant of the state.</p>

                        <h2>b. Reception in Germany</h2>
                        <p>The opposition that marked the Danish reception of <em>Emigrant
                                Literature</em> is set in relief when it is compared to the
                            reception of the work in neighboring countries. Swedish and Norwegian
                            reviewers were otherwise positively inclined toward the work, which was
                            praised for its originality and its lively and engaged manner of
                            presentation. The contrast is still stronger when we look at the
                            reception of <em>Emigrant Literature</em> in Germany, where the book was
                            published in September in 1872. Here Brandes had a fine advocate in the
                            translator Adolf Strodtmann, who in his favorably disposed introduction
                            to the German edition and his somewhat valorizing discussion of Brandes
                            in his book <em>Das geistige Leben in Dänemark</em> (1873) insured that
                            Brandes received the best possible entré to the German literary market
                            (compare Bruns 1977). Brandes was therefore received in Germany as the
                            daring young freethinker who had challenged Danish orthodoxy and had
                            been cut down by reactionary public opinion. The German reception was in
                            a sense no less political than the Danish, but the tendency and the
                            evaluation of the work was the opposite, in that Brandes was received
                            with open arms by liberal German critics and reviewers.</p>
                        <p>It is clearly evident, from the quite positive and receptive reviews and
                            discussions of <em>Emigrant Literature</em> in the German media, that
                            the German reviewers were well informed of the work’s fate in Denmark.
                            In <em>Das Magazin für die Literatur des Auslandes</em> (no. 49,
                            1872:640), Theodor Storm loyally refers to Brandes’ revolt against “die
                            Versumpfung” [quagmire] of Scandinavian intellectual life, and foresees
                            that <em>Emigrant Literature</em> will acquire an epochal significance
                            for the diffusion of European ideas of freedom and progress in the
                            Nordic Countries – “Eine bittere Medizin zwar, aber hoffentlich von
                            heilsamen Folgen” [a bitter medicine, but hopefully with healing
                            effects] (Ibid). At the same time, the reviewer notes with satisfaction
                            that Brandes’ literary historical drama will reach its climax in the
                            young, liberal Germany.</p>
                        <p>The anonymous reviewer in <em>Literarisches Centralblatt</em> similarly
                            lauds Brandes for his uncompromising attack on Danish self-absorption
                            and self-satisfaction. The review focuses especially on Brandes as
                            rhetorician and agitator – “Ein literarischer Gambetta proclamiert
                            Brandes darin die geistige Revolution” [Like a literary Gambetta,
                            Brandes proclaims the intellectual revolution in Denmark] (Anon.
                            1873:820). The lectures are praised for their intellectual riches and
                            elegant art of characterization, and Brandes is likened to a physician
                            who enters a closed up and foul smelling sickroom, peeling back the
                            shutters and opening the windows so that air and sunlight can enter. The
                            reviewer takes exception to the reliance on simplified oppositions in
                                <em>Emigrant Literature</em>, yet at the same time praises the work
                            for its penetrating analogies between different cultural traditions.
                            Brandes’ reform program has our fullest sympathies, concludes the
                            review.</p>
                        <p>Robert Waldmüller (the pseudonym of the author and painter Charles
                            Edouard Duboc), in <em>Blätter für literarische Unterhaltung</em>
                            (Waldmüller 1874:92-3), lauds Brandes as a lone fighter for freedom and
                            modern science in the Scandinavian countries, yet notes also that “Er
                            hat bei diesem Kampfe die liberalen Elemente aller Nationen auf seiner
                            Seite” [in these struggles he has the liberal elements in all nations on
                            his side] (Waldmüller 1874:93). Brandes is again praised for his
                            refreshing and lively form of presentation, and Waldmüller deems
                                <em>Emigrant Literature</em> as a work of interest to all
                            Europe.</p>
                        <p>These three examples show how unlike in Denmark there were favorable
                            conditions in Germany for a liberal and cosmopolitan critic and mediator
                            like Brandes, and this measure of positive interest was influential in
                            Brandes’ decision to pursue a career in Germany in the years following.
                            Thanks to Strodtmann, the subsequent volumes of <em>Main Currents</em>
                            were published almost simultaneously in German editions (Brandes 1873,
                            1874, 1876), and in 1874 Brandes was retained as staff writer for Julius
                            Rodenberg’s newly founded liberal journal <em>Deutsche Rundschau</em>,
                            for which over the course of the next fifteen years he produced a series
                            of important treatises on European authors and cultural personalities,
                            culminating with the long treatment of Friedrich Nietzsche in 1890.</p>
                        <p>The same year that Brandes became affiliated with <em>Deutsche
                                Rundschau</em>, a review of the first three volumes by Friedrich
                            Kreyssig appeared in the October-November issue. Kreyssig also
                            celebrates the cosmopolitan ambition of the work, praising Brandes as a
                            progressive advocate of freedom and modern science, yet additionally
                            points to the disciplinary innovation in Brandes’ methodology. <em>Main
                                Currents</em> is not literary history in the traditional sense,
                            neither biographical-genetic author portraits nor bibliographic annals
                            nor aesthetic art criticism. “Wer also das Buch zur Hand nähme, um etwa
                            auf eine Prüfung über Literaturgeschichte sich vorzubereiten, der ginge
                            gewiss an die falsche Adresse” [Thus he who would take the book in hand
                            to prepare for an exam in literary history would get lost in the trees].
                            In contrast, what Brandes illuminates is the mental labor of literature
                            and the great transformations in the “psychology” of German and French
                            society during the period (Kreyssig 1874:140). At the same time Kreyssig
                            notes that Brandes does not shrink from slogans and anecdotes, but that
                            this trait also constitutes an example of his originality and degree of
                            his emancipation from the Hegelian school of aesthetics.</p>
                        <p>When <em>Emigrant Literature</em> was issued in 1882 as a revised German
                            second edition (Brandes 1882), there followed still another quite
                            favorable review in Blätter für literarische Unterhaltung by Otto
                            Weddingen, who focuses on Brandes’ work as a pioneering contribution to
                            comparative literary studies. Weddingen further identifies Brandes’
                            cultural historical and psychological view of literature as the great
                            merit of the work: “Es ist kein Buch in dem gewöhnlichen Sinne unserer
                            Literaturgeschichten, es ist kein Sammelsurium von Namen und Daten,
                            sondern ein Erzeugnis, welches die Literaturen vom psychologischen
                            Standpunkt aus betrachtet” [it is not a literary history in the
                            conventional sense, not a medley of names and dates, but in contrast a
                            product of the psychological observation of the literatures] (Weddingen
                            1882:750).</p>
                        <p>These last reviews give witness to Brandes’ rising reputation in Germany
                            as literary critic and cosmopolitan mediator – a good European and
                            cultural missionary, as Friedrich Nietzsche summarized his role in the
                            aforementioned private letter of 1887 (Brandes 1966:441). During this
                            same period Brandes also came to play a main role in the introduction of
                            modern Scandinavian literature, for example Henrik Ibsen and
                            Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, to Germany. The status and prestige enjoyed by
                            Brandes in the young radical literary milieu of Germany is apparent in
                            the following character sketch by the theater critic, dramatist and
                            founder of the Berlin-based Naturalist theater Freie Bühne, Otto Brahm,
                            published in <em>Frankfurter Zeitung</em> on March 3rd, 1884, on the
                            occasion of a staging of Ibsen’s <em>Ghosts</em>:</p>
                        <blockquote>We Germans cannot look on the development of Nordic poetry
                            without envy . . . a cohesive literary movement . . . which aims at the
                            liberation of the mind from the depths of darkness . . . It is with a
                            “golden recklessness” that Ibsen and Bjørnson and the youth of
                            Scandinavia, who have a leader in Georg Brandes, fight against the
                            medieval oppression that burdens the minds of these bishop ruled
                            countries . . . When Georg Brandes some fifteen years ago awakened his
                            countrymen by telling of the “main currents” of modern literature, a new
                            epoch broke out; just as the classical period in our literature emanated
                            from Lessing and Herder, this breakthrough occurred at the urging of a
                            purely critical intellect (Brahm 1913:74).</blockquote>
                        <p>Riding the Scandinavian wave and the fame of Brandes in Germany, a series
                            of new collected editions of <em>Main Currents</em> were published in
                            the 1890s, and thus a new round of reviews followed, in which the
                            continued acknowledgment of Brandes as the leading figure of the Modern
                            Breakthrough in Scandinavian literatures was blended with new critical
                            voices. An example of the new engagement is Franz Mehring’s review of
                            the collected edition of <em>Main Currents</em> in <em>Die neue
                                Zeit</em>, in which Brandes meets with criticism for his bourgeois
                            and idealistic conception of history: “Als bürgerlicher Schriftsteller
                            bewegt sich Brandes immer auf idealistischem Boden; er behauptet zwar
                            gelegentlich überall ins Leben zurückzugreifen, aber die Erkenntnis,
                            dass sich die literarische Bewegung in letzter Instanz aus der
                            ökonomischen Entwicklung erklärt, ist ihm fremd” [As a bourgeois author
                            Brandes treads always upon idealistic ground; sure enough he
                            occasionally asserts that he reaches back toward life in all areas, yet
                            the awareness that the literary movement in the end is a mirroring of
                            economic development is alien to him]. Yet Mehring concludes by praising
                            Brandes for his lively and intellectually abundant style, which
                            “schmeckt wie feuriger Wein, verglichen mit der faden Limonade der
                            preussischen Literaturgeschichte” [tastes like a fiery wine when
                            compared to the flavorless lemonade of Prussian literary history”
                            (Mehring 1893-4:311).</p>

                        <h2>c. Reception in France</h2>
                        <p>The favorable German reception of <em>Emigrant Literature</em> can be
                            compared to the book’s fate in France. That such a comparison is of
                            particular interest is due not only to the fact that the book was about
                            French literature, but also because France at the time enjoyed status as
                            the first nation of the world literary republic. Paris was the cultural
                            center for artistic and literary innovation in Europe and the world –
                            the place from which new literary and artistic movements emanated and in
                            which the respective criteria of literary quality and modernity were
                            set. For these reasons the French market, for Brandes and successive
                            generations of Scandinavian authors, constituted the promised land, the
                            place where more than any other it was desired to have one’s texts
                            published and evaluated. Yet as we shall see, France was the place in
                            Europe in which Brandes had the greatest difficulty in establishing a
                            name for himself, because national arrogance and resistance to literary
                            influence from abroad was so much stronger there than elsewhere.</p>
                        <p><em>Emigrant Literature</em> was otherwise substantially introduced
                            already in 1873, in the form of a more than thirty-page article by Henri
                            Blaze de Bury in the November issue of the leading cosmopolitan journal
                            of the age, <em>Revue des deux mondes</em>. The article contains no
                            critical evaluation of the work, instead consisting of a congenial and
                            gripping summary of the main ideas of <em>Emigrant Literature</em>
                            (based on the Strodtmann’s German translation from 1872), supplemented
                            by a series of original French citations from Chateaubriand and Madame
                            de Staël. The Francophone world thus had an early opportunity to become
                            acquainted with Brandes’ comparative understanding of literature and his
                            principal literary historical thesis on the main current in 19th century
                            European literature as an interplay between the spirit of Voltaire and
                            the spirit of Rousseau.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, ten years would pass before the French public would again
                            here of Brandes, this time in the form of a critical profile by Arvède
                            Barine (the pseudonym of Madame Charles Vincens) in <em>La Revue
                                Blanche</em> (Barine 1883). This article is of particular interest
                            in that it contains a morally and ideologically grounded critique of
                            Brandes’ vision of humanity and society in <em>Emigrant Literature</em>.
                            Barine characterizes Brandes as a “sectarian” disciple of Rousseau,
                            asserting that his temperament was carried away by his passionate
                            struggle for natural rights and individual freedom at the expense of
                            “civilization” and social morality. As a counter argument, she argues
                            that the laws of society and moral rules of conduct in a modern
                            civilized society also and especially serve the function of protecting
                            people against infringement. Barine thus contests the democratic
                            starting point of Brandes’ radicalism, in that she suggests that the
                            consequence of his struggle for the emancipation of the individual in
                            reality would lead to a legitimization of the right of the stronger.</p>
                        <p>Despite these and other more literary historical objections, Barine
                            concludes however by expressing her fervent acknowledgment of Brandes’
                            bold attempt to present a synthesis of this chaotic chapter in French
                            literary history from the opposition between Voltaire and Rousseau,
                            predicting a grand career for Brandes in the future. At the conclusion
                            of the review it is evident that Brandes’ work appeals to a certain form
                            of national sentiment among French critics, which is underscored by
                            their gratitude toward the Dane’s immense service in having demonstrated
                            how the main currents of 19th century European literature originated in
                            France. “We are no longer pampered by these kinds of complements,” the
                            review concludes (Barine 1883:764).</p>
                        <p>This concluding formulation provides a little glimpse of the national
                            attitude of defeatism that marked the cultural climate of France after
                            defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. This defeatist attitude is at
                            the same time an important aspect of the relative insularity of the
                            French literary market of the time – in comparison to developments in
                            the contemporary German book market, which among other things was
                            characterized by a burst of translation activity, not only of
                            Scandinavian literature. There were thus also historical and structural
                            reasons that the diffusion of <em>Main Currents</em> proceeded
                            sluggishly in France, where only one of the six volumes, namely the
                            fifth, <em>The Romantic School in France</em>, managed to be published
                            in French translation at the time.</p>
                        <p>Just as Brandes during his Berlin exile (1877-83) had established for
                            himself a position as a European literary critic in Germany, it was his
                            great disappointment that there was minimal interest for his works in
                            France. His disappointment palpably comes to expression in a letter to
                            his friend Noufflard, dated January 26th, 1888. The concrete background
                            for this was the ironic twist that two English journals, <em>The
                                Spectator</em> and <em>Saturday Review</em>, had discussed the
                                <em>German</em> Georg Brandes as “the greatest living critic,” which
                            provided Brandes the opportunity to offer a few observations regarding
                            power relations in the world literary republic:</p>
                        <blockquote>Je lis toujours beaucoup de Français. J’aime votre littérature
                            plus que toute autre. J’ai écrit plus de livres sur la France que sur
                            tout autre pays et pourtant je suis parfaitement inconnu en France.
                            Quand j’avais écrit un seul article sur les Flamands on était prêt à
                            m’ériger des statues en Flandre; tout les poètes m’envoyaient leurs
                            œuvres, tous les journaux parlaient de moi. Quand j’ai écrit deux petits
                            articles sur les écrivains Russes sans même savoir leur langue, on a été
                            tellement touché de mes connaissances qu’on m’a loué, m’a traduit, m’a
                            fait venir. Sur la France j’ai écrit plus de volumes que je n’ai écrit
                            d’articles sur la Russie, et on sait à peine que j’existe. Un certain
                            Charles Simond veut me traduire; depuis deux ans il cherche en vain un
                            éditeur, bien que Paul Bourget m’ait offert d’écrire une introduction.
                            Cela m’attriste un peu, car une réputation n’est pas consacrée aussi
                            longtemps que la France n’a pas dit son mot.</blockquote>

                            knowing the language, they were so moved by knowledge of them that I was
                            praised, translated and invited to visit. I have written more books on
                            France than I have articles on Russia, and still the French hardly know

                            the measure of an author has not been established as long as France has
                            withheld its judgement]. (Brandes 1952:131-2).</blockquote>
                        <p>In the meantime the judgement of France arrived in 1893 in the form of a
                            new twenty page critical article in <em>Revue de deux mondes</em>, in
                            which the critic Jean Thorel critically examined the <em>Main
                                Currents</em> on the occasion of the newly published, collected
                            German edition of <em>Die Litteratur des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts in
                                ihren Hauptströmningen</em>, issued by the Leipzig house Veit &amp;
                            Co. (1882-92).</p>
                        <p>Thorel begins by affirming Brandes’ rising reputation as European
                            literary critic in Germany and by contesting the view of German critics
                            that French national chauvinism is a reason that his work has been
                            ignored in France. According to Thorel, this lack of acknowledgement in
                            France is due more to the fact that Brandes is not a literary critic at
                            all, but first and foremost a polemicist whose chief cause from the
                            beginning had been to fight against and ultimately destroy every form of
                            religion. Brandes’ anti-clerical agenda was however of less relevance in
                            the French context, and what the Danish critic had to say about French
                            literature in <em>Emigrant Literature</em> did not impress the French
                            critic. Brandes’ tiny selection of authors and works from the period was
                            “wholly insufficient” and all too selective to fulfill the ambition of
                            portraying the main currents of 19th psychology (Thorel 1893:343).
                            Thorel further opposed the abstract Hegelian scheme itself that
                            undergirded Brandes’ dramatic arrangement of 19th century European
                            literary history as an interplay and a synthesis between the spirit of
                            Voltaire and the spirit of Rousseau, in that he could not comprehend
                            what kind of common “liberal” spirit could be attributed to the
                            intellectual essences of Voltaire, Rousseau, Lessing, and Schiller.</p>
                        <p>At the same time Thorel pointed out an internal contradiction in Brandes’
                            methodology and program for the comparative view of literature, which
                            consisted on the one hand of affirming the prior lack of exchange
                            between European national literatures, and on the other, the assertion
                            that the literary works and types in the different literatures were
                            casually connected and determinative of one another. If one was really
                            to study the deeper and lasting influences between the literatures, then
                            according to Thorel one must abandon the politicizing contemporary
                            perspective on literature, instead going to the sources themselves.
                            Evident in this objection is the influence of contemporary comparative
                            literary studies, which had set new scientific standards for literary
                            criticism according to which a positivistic interest in
                                <em>influences</em> between works and authors had supplanted the
                            older literary historical romantic-idealistic doctrine of a universal
                            spirit in history. From this perspective Thorel also criticizes the
                            construction of the six volumes of <em>Main Currents</em>, arguing that
                            the book on German Romanticism should have come before the volume on
                            French emigrant literature. De Staël continued the work of the German
                            Romantics, not vice versa. Again the problem was the politicizing
                            Hegelian scheme that placed the abstract main currents and the
                            oppositions between action and reaction over and above literary
                            historical fact and chronology, thus leading to an artificial division
                            on the literature of the period.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of the review the French critic marshals all of his
                            weapons in order to deprive Brandes of any claim to legitimacy or
                            originality as literary historian. Brandes’ work was nothing other than
                            “a long, confused and indirect defense [plaidoyer]” of political ideas
                            that were alien to literature and as such would have demanded a wholly
                            different approach than that pursued in the work. From the point of view
                            of literary history, Brandes’ efforts amounted to nothing other than
                            ephemeral compilation: </p>
                        <blockquote>[…] quelque bruit qui ait été fait autour de son nom et de ses
                            livres, on s’aperçoit, le premier moment d’étonnement passé, qu’il n’y a
                            là rien qui mérite d’arrêter l’attention plus qu’il ne convient de le
                            faire pour une compilation, momentanement utile à cause de la masse des
                            materiaux qui y sont rassemblés, mais que demain le premier compilateur
                            venu pourra refaire avec plus de méthode et de clarté, ce qui rendra
                            tout de suite inutile, – même comme compilation, – toute l’œuvre de M.
                            Brandes.</blockquote>
                        <blockquote>[regardless of all the hubbub surrounding his name and his
                            books, as soon as the initial bemusement has passed, one discovers that
                            there is nothing in his work that deserves attention other than that it
                            is passable as a kind of compilation, which at the moment is useful
                            because of the great mass of material collected within it, but which
                            tomorrow will be able to be reworked with more methodological skill and
                            greater clarity than the initial compiler has exhibited, which will
                            immediately render Mr. Brandes’ entire work obsolete, even as a
                            compilation]. (Thorel 1893:358)</blockquote>
                        <p>Thorel’s violent dismissal of Brandes is part of a debate in 1890s
                            literary France that revolved around how one should relate to the new
                            and foreign literary expressions and influences that had been introduced
                            to the country during the period. Just as in Germany, France was also
                            witness to a Scandinavian wave that manifested itself in translations
                            and in Paris productions of modern Scandinavian dramatists such as
                            Ibsen, Bjørnson and Strindberg. Yet at the same time the French literary
                            public was also capable of exhibiting an equally fervent opposition to
                            the present “Scandophilia” or “Nordomania,” articulated by nationally
                            oriented literati and theater critics who desired to protect France’s
                            national poetics and its hegemony in the world literary republic against
                            foreign influence. Thorel’s attempt to deprive Brandes of his status as
                            leading European literary critic also follows this pattern.</p>
                        <p>In relation to the positive reception of Brandes in Germany, it is
                            interesting that it was in republican and secular France that Brandes’
                            work encountered the most engaged moral and ideological opposing voices.
                            It is further interesting to note that a majority of the objections to
                            Brandes in French criticism (such as the charges of politicizing art and
                            disavowing religion) were the same as those he had encountered in the
                            national liberal Danish public of 1872 – but with the important
                            difference that French critics understood the difference between
                            liberalism and socialism. In the same manner as in Denmark after the
                            defeat of 1864, France’s defeat in the Franco-Prussian War in 1871 had
                            rendered political and literary opinion in the country more national and
                            thereby less receptive to a cosmopolitan critic like Brandes.</p>
                        <p>Taken together these examples demonstrate how political conditions both
                            at home and abroad impacted the reception of <em>Emigrant
                                Literature</em>.</p>

                        <h2>d. Later Scholarship</h2>
                        <p>Paul V. Rubow is correctly viewed as the founder of scientific Brandes
                            scholarship, by virtue of his treatise “Georg Brandes’ Forhold til
                            Hippolyte Taine og C.A. Sainte Beuve” (published in <em>Edda</em> VI
                            1916 and <em>Litterære Studier</em>, 1928), which outlines how Brandes’
                            earliest practice as literary critic took form under the influence of
                            the two French models. Rubow thereby set the direction for early Brandes
                            scholarship, which was first and foremost comparatively oriented, e.g.
                            seeking to show the decisive literary, philosophical and theoretical
                            influences that shaped Brandes as critic. In <em>Georg Brandes’
                                Briller</em> (1928), Rubow accentuates his relationship to the
                            philosopher Søren Kierkegaard as critical to the development of Brandes’
                            combative personality.</p>
                        <p>A necessary supplement to Rubow is Gunnar Ahlström’s dissertation
                                <em>Georg Brandes’ Hovedstrømninger</em> (1937), which examines the
                            influence of Hegel and German post-Hegelianism as the essential
                            ideological and historical philosophical inspiration for <em>Main
                                Currents</em>.</p>
                        <p>Henning Fenger’s dissertation <em>Georg Brandes’ Læreår</em> (1955)
                            outlines the entirety of Brandes’ literary and scientific education up
                            to the breakthrough with <em>Emigrant Literature</em>, with special
                            emphasis on the inspiration he took from French Romanticism. A main
                            point in the dissertation is expressed in the pregnant characterization
                            of Brandes as “a Romantic who spent his life fighting against
                            Romanticism” (Fenger 1955:407).</p>
                        <p>In <em>Den unge Brandes. Miljø. Venner. Rejser. Kriser.</em> (1957) – the
                            follow up to his dissertation – Fenger proposes an alternative
                            background for <em>Emigrant Literature</em>, which blew up the
                            comparative approach by seeking the cause of Brandes’ combativeness and
                            critique of marriage in biographical circumstances: Brandes’ impossible,
                            yet no less impassioned love affair with the (unhappily) married
                            Caroline David, twelve years his senior. “We cannot understand much of
                            Brandes in the years 1867-72 if we are not aware of this relationship,
                            which functions as the secret code of his critical writings, not the
                            least the lectures of 1871 and 1872” (Fenger 1957:119-20). </p>
                        <p>The biographical approach to Brandes is followed to its fullest extent by
                            Jørgen Knudsen in <em>Georg Brandes. Frigørelsens vej. 1842-77</em>
                            (1985), which constitutes the first of the eight volumes of his grand
                            Brandes biography (1985-2004).</p>
                        <p>Bertil Nolin’s monograph <em>Den gode europén</em> (1965), subtitled
                                <em>Studier i Georg Brandes’ idéutvekling. 1871-1893</em>, follows
                            up where Rubow and Fenger leave off, in that it analyzes Brandes’
                            activity and development as critic during the twenty-year period in
                            which <em>Main Currents</em> was produced. The treatise takes its title
                            from Nietzsche’s previously mentioned famous characterization of Brandes
                            as “the good European and cultural missionary,” and outlines how Brandes
                            wrote his to way to this status through his broad orientation in
                            contemporary German, English, Slavic, and French literature. Nolin is
                            also the author of the best all-around guide to Brandes’ authorship in
                            the form of the English-language introduction <em>Georg Brandes</em>
                            (1976), which includes a short and precise analysis of the course of the
                            affair of <em>Emigrant Literature</em>.</p>
                        <p>In continuation of the comparative tradition within Brandes scholarship,
                            which had focused on Brandes as literary critic, a central direction
                            within scholarship since the 1970s has focused on the political and
                            activist dimension of Brandes’ work. On the hundredth anniversary of
                            Brandes’ lectures on emigrant literature, Copenhagen University hosted a
                            series of lectures published in 1973 under the title <em>Den politiske
                                Georg Brandes</em>, edited by Hans Hertel and Sven Møller
                            Kristensen. In 1978, Hertel and Kristensen further organized an
                            international symposium with around thirty participants from eleven
                            countries, which in 1980 resulted in <em>The Activist Critic. A
                                Symposium on the Political Ideas, Literary Methods and International
                                Reception of Georg Brandes</em>, which constitutes a milestone in
                            modern Brandes scholarship, both by analyzing Brandes’ efforts as a
                            liberal and activist critic and by tracing the reception of his works
                            across Europe and the rest of the world.</p>
                        <p>The role, status and reach of Brandes as international literary critic
                            and intellectual was again in 2008 the object of an international
                            conference, held in Nancy in France. The conference resulted in the 2010
                            publication of the book <em>Grands courants d’échanges Intellectuels:
                                Georg Brandes et la France, L’Allemagne, L’Angleterre</em>
                            (Bourguignon et al., eds., 2010), which likewise contains a series of
                            interesting contributions illuminating the international historical
                            impact of Brandes.</p>
                        <p>Three doctoral dissertations containing analyses of Emigrant Literature
                            have been published in Denmark in the last decade. Svend Skriver’s
                                <em>Europæere i 1800-tallets danske litteratur: Om Jens Baggesen,
                                P.L. Møller og Georg Brandes</em> (2007) contains a literary
                            historiographical analysis of the narrative devices and “strategies of
                            internationalization” in <em>Emigrant Literature</em>, without however
                            addressing Brandes’ strategies of international publication and the

                                1870-1920</em> (2016) provides a detailed sociological investigation
                            of the course of events surrounding the denial of the professorship in
                            aesthetics at Copenhagen University to Brandes after 1872. The
                            dissertation outlines how moral and religious concerns, rather than
                            scientific arguments, were the reason that a majority of the professors
                            on the faculty opposed Brandes..</p>
                        <p>Finally, Georg Brandes’ conflicted relation to Judaism has been made the
                            object of an independent investigation by Søren Blak Hjortshøj,
                                <em>Georg Brandes’ Representation of Jewishness</em> (2017). His
                            thesis is that even though Brandes often distanced himself Judaism, it
                            can at the same time be observed how throughout his whole authorship he
                            is interested in the role of the Jew in history and the Jewish
                            contribution to the development of Western civilization. Hjortshøj thus
                            argues for a point of view that has also been expressed above, that
                            there is a connection between Brandes’ cosmopolitan vision of literary
                            history and his own particular experiences as a Jew. Through an analysis
                            of the topos of exile in Brandes’ early authorship, Hjortshøj
                            demonstrates how Brandes saw the modern European Jew as a historical
                            type that, precisely by virtue of his homelessness and lack of anchoring
                            in a national tradition, was especially disposed to play the role of
                            cosmopolitan bridge builder and pioneer of Europe’s cultural and
                            political modernization (Hjortshøj 2017:43-77).</p>

                        <h2>e. Concluding Perspective</h2>
                        <p>Thus we arrive back at the question of Brandes relevance to the 21st
                            century. As suggested many times along the way, both Brandes’
                            cosmopolitan vision of European literature and his profound sympathy
                            with emigrant experience can be brought into dialogue with the views of
                            late 20th and early 20th century postcolonial literary criticism, which
                            shares an interest in the connection between Western modernity, mobility
                            and migration. A fundamental idea in postcolonial literary criticism is
                            that modern Western identity is decisively shaped by European nations’
                            past as colonial powers and the various long term effects of such. Thus
                            postcolonial criticism accentuates European and Western culture and
                            identity as a phenomenon that has come into being through the encounter
                            with the alien and which has the experience and the homelessness and
                            foreignness of emigrants built into it – which is simultaneously a
                            traumatic yet necessary and unavoidable experience and a part of
                            itself.</p>
                        <p>As the Palestinian-American professor of literature Edward W. Said has
                            emphasized, modern Western culture is to a wide extent a product of the
                            exiled, the emigrant, the refugee. In the same place Said stresses how
                            exile and emigrant literature can articulate “a contrapuntal
                            consciousness” (Said 2008:148), e.g. an awareness of difference and
                            openness to the alien that renders us able to consort with people and
                            cultural forms of expression that are different from our own. Another
                            central voice of postcolonial theory, the Indian-English scholar Homi K.
                            Bhabha, has with his concept of “hybridity” identified the mixing of
                            races and the meeting of cultures as the very space of creativity and
                            innovation in a globalized culture (Bhabha 1994).</p>
                        <p>Such ways of thinking can almost sound like the Romantic music of the
                            past in light of our age of the global movement of refugees and migrants
                            and reawakened nationalism, but they also provide the opportunity to
                            reassess the contemporary relevance of Brandes’ comparative and cultural
                            critical methodology.</p>

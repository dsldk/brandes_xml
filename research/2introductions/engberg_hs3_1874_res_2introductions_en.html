            <h1 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
            <p>Of the six volumes that constitute <em>Main Currents in 19th Century Literature</em>,
                    <em>The Reaction in France</em> is the least literary and most historically
                oriented. Nevertheless, it occupies a central position within Brandes’ peculiar form
                of literary history. The reactionary currents of the Empire (1804-14) and the
                Restoration (1814-30) mark the negative pole in his portrait of the intellectual and
                emotional life of the first half of the 19th century. The first two volumes trace
                the steadily rising reaction against 18th century ideals of freedom, first in the
                literature of French emigres and then in German Romanticism. Now Brandes describes
                the triumph of the reaction. History winds its way from Voltaire’s Kingdom of Reason
                through Rousseau’s Kingdom of Feeling, only to end up in a delta of conservative,
                nationalistic and repressive attitudes. This delta Brandes subsumes under the term
                “the principal of authority.”</p>
            <p>In his presentation of this historical development, especially in the first half of
                the volume, aesthetic literary criticism fades somewhat into the background in favor
                of a focus on historical fact and on the history of ideas as they are expressed in
                the form of philosophical and social treatises. Yet this apparent shift in
                perspective points toward something more fundamental in his larger project. Brandes
                writes at precisely the moment at which comparative literature is about to establish
                itself as an independent discipline in Europe and the United States. He has often
                been identified as a central figure in the development of comparative literary
                studies, or even more strongly as its principal founder. But how does Brandes
                understand what he refers to as a “comparative literary perspective” (Brandes
                1872:8), and what role do “the currents” play in it?</p>
            <p>The theoretical frame of <em>Main Currents</em> is a peculiar construction blending
                together quite distinct theoretical positions. The influence of French aesthetic
                theory is palpable, particularly Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve and Hippolyte Taine,
                whom Brandes had discussed in his 1870 dissertation. But Brandes supplements French
                aesthetic theory with a Hegelian frame, albeit in a modified form. Whereas Hegel had
                defined the motor of (literary) history as metaphysics, Brandes replaces this with
                an alloy of ideas, feelings, and moods. It is this alloy that constitutes the
                essence of Brandes’ “currents,” these elements that determine history and whose
                character and development can be extrapolated from literature.</p>
            <p>This composite theoretical construction manifests itself throughout on the plane of
                metaphor. Alongside concepts from the empirical sciences, primarily botany and
                zoology, Brandes employs a recurring metaphorics of water: ideas surge forth in
                torrents, moods ferment in the morass, feelings are dammed up by dykes but soon
                flood the banks. Brandes develops a kind of hydraulic literary theory to represent
                the ebb and flow of the main literary currents, for the task of the comparatist is,
                according to Brandes, to describe through literature the development and the
                movement of the ideas, feelings and moods of a given historical period, and to
                channel their energies into the present. </p>
            <p><em>The Reaction in France</em> (and <em>Main Currents</em> as such), in its
                comparative methodology, and its peculiar metaphorics, thus amounts at the same time
                to a history of ideas, a literary history and a history of feelings of the first
                half of the 19th century.</p>

            <h1 id="background">2. Background and Genesis</h1>
            <p>1873 was a productive year for Brandes. In February and March he delivered twelve
                lectures on the German Romantic school, which were quickly published as the second
                volume of <em>Main Currents</em> on May 3rd. Now it was time to prepare for the next
                volume on the reaction in France.</p>
            <p>In June Brandes left Denmark for Germany, where he remained for the next four months.
                Aside from shorter excursions to Dresden and Leipzig he was chiefly in Berlin and in
                Munich, where he wrote the first four lectures at the library. Since his student
                years Brandes’ social life had vacillated between a gregarious desire for dialogue
                and debate and a contemplative hermetic existence. That Janus-faced tendency
                revealed itself again during his sojourn in Germany. When he was not sequestered in
                the Munich library he often found himself in the company of the poet Paul Heyse,
                with whom he maintained a long written correspondence. Heyse’s cheerful and
                optimistic disposition lifted Brandes’ spirits, who, as he notes himself, had been
                in the habit of seeing only “how damned awful everything really was” (Brandes
                1907:133).</p>
            <p>Heyse and Brandes also had their intellectual differences. This became clear, for
                example, in their discussions of the relation between literature and the age in
                which it was written. As is evident from the first two volumes of <em>Main
                    Currents</em>, Brandes subscribed to a strong historical determinism. No author
                existed outside historical circumstances, and literary works were directly
                conditioned by them. Heyse’s response, that the laws which govern intellectual
                development are far more indeterminate and capricious than those that govern nature,
                began to weaken Brandes’ fundamental understanding of the relation between the
                particular and the universal and thus the status of the literary work in relation to
                broader historical developments. While this change was yet to manifest itself in the
                design of the third volume, Brandes did revel in the lavish praise Heyse had for
                    <em>The Romantic School in Germany</em>, which had been subjected to harsh
                treatment in Denmark (Brandes 1907:127-33).</p>
            <p>In Berlin Brandes vacillated between an almost ascetic existence and its opposite.
                “There is not much to report on my part,” he wrote to his brother Edvard.</p>
            <blockquote> Nothing terrible has happened to me. No one has the slightest thought of
                such. Moreover I have not visited anyone, which has been made all the easier, since
                all my acquaintances are away from Berlin such that no one knows I am here again. I
                read almost the entire day in preparation for my book (Edvard and Georg Brandes
                1972:83).</blockquote>
            <p> His German translator Adolf Strodtmann and his wife Henriette, however, also lived
                in the Steglitz district where Brandes was staying.</p>
            <p>Their interactions during the summer develop into a stormy affair between Brandes and
                Henny, as Brandes calls her. A certain ambivalence is present on his part,
                nevertheless Brandes writes to Heyse down in Munich: “I could well do without that
                person. But were I to succeed in breaking it off, I would lose all faith in anything
                solid here in the world” (Brandes 1966:67) [Ich konnte wol [sic] dieses Wesen
                entbehren. Aber gelang es mir den Faden zu zerreissen, dann hätte ich allen Glauben
                an irgend etwas Festes in der Welt verloren]. Brandes initially tries to compel
                Henny to divorce, but she is reluctant. It is a precarious situation, hardly eased
                by the fact that Strodtmann has yet to finish translating <em>Main Currents</em>,
                seeing that Brandes himself has yet to complete the project. They decide not to
                reveal their relationship until Brandes has finished the work and Strodtmann has
                translated it. But in the end the lovers cannot wait that long. Already a year later
                the affair is revealed, and two years after Henriette Strodtmann becomes Gerda
                Brandes (Knudsen 1985:327-40). In the meantime Brandes leaves Germany alone on
                September 30th, returning to Copenhagen to complete the lectures. He delivers the
                first of the these on October 28th, and <em>The Reaction in France</em> is published
                on February 13th, 1874.</p>
            <p>From the very beginning any reader will be struck by the tone of the work. in <em>The
                    Reaction in France</em> Brandes’ usual confrontational style reaches its apex;
                he himself referred to it as “the most polemical of all my writings” (Brandes
                1907:143). This is due not only to the theme – the powerful conservative forces he
                describes – but also to the political conditions of his own time as well as his
                personal situation. The reactionary assault on Brandes by a segment of the Danish
                press, the dismissal of his application for a lectureship, and the monarchical and
                religious political tendencies present especially in France are distilled into a
                more combative attitude:</p>
            <blockquote>I labored strenuously, plagued by dismay, poverty, and the hostility of my
                surroundings. This part of the work was according to the plan the most negative, in
                that it was the most fruitful opportunity to give voice to the bitterness that had
                accumulated in my mind, to my hatred of those who would lobotomize humanity and of
                the very air breathed by the oppressors. I was thinking of the reaction in
                contemporary France while I wrote about the reaction of the past. (Brandes 1907:151) </blockquote>
            <p>The dismissal the previous year of his application for an interim lectureship in
                aesthetics or general literary history has also contributed to his bad mood,
                especially because no one on the selection committee doubted his scientific
                qualifications. The objection was to Brandes’ progressive views with respect to
                established institutions such as society, the family and religion. In his two-page
                opinion, the Slavicist C.W. Smith, the only member of the committee to have attended
                his lectures, wrote that while no one could require Brandes to be a Christian, “one
                can demand of a Danish man of conscience that he not desire to undermine the respect
                for the institutions considered holy by the nation among an impressionable youth
                (the majority of which are of the other sex)” (Larsen 2016:90). </p>
            <p>Brandes was thus completely surrounded by reactionary forces, including those present
                in contemporary European politics, the newspapers and the Danish university as well
                as by the reactionary nature of the literary and historical material with which he
                was occupied. Together these forces incited the inner polemicist in Brandes,
                sharpening his pen into barbed, uncompromising and often remarkably well-written
                attacks on the authority principle and its advocates. <em>The Reaction in
                    France</em> is therefore shaped by the dismay and bitterness that the present
                age had inculcated in Brandes, which he tried to transform into a combative polemic
                against reaction and ignorance. In the afterword to the second volume, written to
                his teacher Hans Brøchner, Brandes had been very clear: “a book for me is an act”
                (Brandes 1873:379). This statement could serve as the epigraph of the third volume.
                With rhetorical excess and polemical sting, Brandes battles against the reaction not
                only in history, but also in his own time, on the political stage, in the
                newspapers, and at the University of Copenhagen.</p>

                <h1 id="methodology">3. What is a “Current?” Brandes’ Methodology</h1>
                <div>
                    <h2>a. Brandes as Historian of Ideas</h2>
                    <p>Literature seems to play a secondary role in <em>The Reaction in France</em>.
                        In large sections of the volume literary works are most notable for their
                        absence in Brandes’ portrayal of the development, triumph and fall of an
                        idea – the idea he calls the authority principle. He dives deep into the
                        Empire and Restoration in order to identify manifestations of the principle
                        in the historical circumstances of the Concordat of 1801, that is the
                        acknowledgment and privileging of the Catholic Church by the French state,
                        and in the conservative social-philosophical treatises of Joseph de Maistre
                        and Louis de Bonald on matters such as religion and marriage. The authority
                        principle has taken such a hold that it now constitutes the reigning idea of
                        the era. For Brandes the Church is the central core of the principle, for in
                        his words this was “the golden age of the priests” (Brandes 1874:337). Thus
                        in the first part of <em>The Reaction in France</em> Brandes interrogates
                        the political and social ideas about religion, state and marriage
                        represented by the Church, as well as decisive historical events such as
                        Napoleon’s effort to employ a restored Church as a central power player.
                        Only later does he concern himself with the literary works of the period.
                        From these works he extrapolates the emergence of conservative ideas, after
                        which he rounds out the volume with the overcoming of the authority
                        principle both on the formal plane of literature and on the concrete plane
                        of politics and society.</p>
                    <p>That Brandes is less occupied with literature in the third volume reveals a
                        fundamental characteristic of <em>Main Currents</em> as a whole. Brandes is
                        interested in large ideas – freedom, emancipation, enlightenment – and in
                        the zigzagging progress of these ideas in the struggle against their
                        opposites – authority, reaction, ignorance. Already in the introductory
                        lecture of 1871 he declares this clearly: “the central subject of these
                        lectures is the reaction in the initial decades of the 19th century against
                        the literature of the 18th century, and the overcoming of that reaction”
                        (Brandes 1872:7-8).</p>
                    <p>Brandes’ literary analyses in <em>The Reaction in France</em> follow along in
                        the slipstream of his account of the history of ideas. In this manner the
                        status of literature as empirical material in the scientific project is made
                        apparent. One of Brandes’ central perspectives on literature is to view it
                        as a symptom, a surface phenomenon from which one can extrapolate the more
                        deeply rooted movement of the history of ideas. Because the idea “stamps”
                        all literary genres, “the epic, the novel, the poem, the ode, even the
                        theater, with its distinguishing mark” (Brandes 1874:122), Brandes can say
                        of his approach to Victor Hugo:</p>
                    <blockquote>In these initial odes of Hugo let us study less the poet than the
                        age in which he came into existence. They go through the whole of France’s
                        history from 1789 onward to 1825 and contain the entirety of the
                        Restoration’s official system of views. (Brandes 1874:276)</blockquote>
                    <p>We might say that Brandes writes literary history in the service of the
                        history of ideas. When he holds up a literary text to the light, it is the
                        silhouettes of the ideas of the age that appear to his analytical gaze.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>b. Brandes as Historian of Feelings</h2>
                    <p>However prominently ideas feature in the third volume of <em>Main
                            Currents</em>, Brandes is not exclusively a historian of ideas.
                        Literature also represents a different and more fundamental phenomenon. The
                        works of Chateaubriand, Alfred de Vigny and Victor Hugo are not just
                        symptomatic of a series of clearly defined ideas, but also of more obscure
                        and more formless feelings and moods. As Brandes repeatedly notes throughout
                        the six volumes, his primary task is “to provide an outline of the
                        psychology of the first half of the 19th century” (Brandes 1890:570). By
                        reading “literary history as psychologically as possible,” Brandes believes
                        that he can “grasp the movements of the soul, which farthest back, deepest
                        down and in every case, <em>prepar</em>e and <em>bring forth</em> literature
                        into existence [italics mine]” (Brandes 1873:4). Brandes is once again
                        reading literature symptomatically, but as empirical material it has
                        precedence over the philosophical treatises and commentaries of Louis de
                        Bonald, Joseph de Maistre and Félicité de Lammenais. Whereas they provide
                        access to the ideas, literature can provide insight into the changing moods
                        and feelings of the period. Already in his dissertation on <em>Contemporary
                            French Aesthetics</em>, Brandes asserts the privileged status of
                        literature when he writes that “a superb poem, a good novel, the confession
                        of a great man, all these are more instructive than letters of state or
                        political treatises” (Brandes 1903, 13:247).</p>
                    <p>The aesthetic theory underpinning this conception of literature is the
                        critical praxis of C.A. Sainte-Beuve. In a revolt against philosophical
                        criticism, which had isolated the work from history and from the author just
                        as the New Criticism of the 20th century would do once again, Sainte-Beuve
                        practiced a psychological criticism that traced the work back to the
                        personality and the character of the author. For Brandes this constituted a
                        wholly decisive shift that asserted the precedence of literature over
                        ordinary historical inquiry. </p>
                    <blockquote>Thus Sainte-Beauve’s reforms have made literary history, which
                        before had been an adjunct to actual historical studies, into its
                        trailblazer, the most soulful, most lively form of history, because
                        literature constitutes altogether the most interesting and richest material
                        with which the historian can grapple. (Brandes 1882:494-5)</blockquote>
                    <p>Only in literature can we get a sense of the enthusiasm, the hatred, the
                        erotic spark or the seraphic-platonic coldness, the languor or the downcast
                        self-ironic attitude that an author has felt at any given point. Yet
                        Sainte-Beauve’s pointillist form of criticism of individual authors did not
                        permit larger syntheses. Brandes takes the further step of expanding the
                        psychological approach from the individual to the period. From the animating
                        feelings of the individual work he infers the feelings of the author, from
                        which he then infers a group of feelings, which together constitute the soul
                        of the period (Brandes 1873:20). In <em>The Reaction in France</em> the
                        poetic-religious spirit of the Restoration is incarnated in figures such as
                        Chateaubriand and de Vigny, but especially in Madame de Krüdener, since as
                        Brandes asserts “if as a rule the spirit of an age is typically mirrored in
                        its most prominent figures, then it is doubly so with respect to those whose
                        character is defined by being a convert to that spirit, especially if this
                        personality is a woman” (Brandes 1874:203). In gathering together the
                        isolated literary expressions of the era, Brandes is able to form the whole
                        he seeks – a psychology of the first half of the 19th century. The fact that
                        Brandes found the Restoration authors mediocre and regarded the social
                        commentators of the period as nothing short of criminals is in this context
                        of secondary importance. They have all, in a mediocre and criminal manner,
                        articulated the reigning ideas and feelings of the age. They must therefore
                        be included, for otherwise Brandes’ grand account of the psychology of
                        European humanity would contain a lacuna. </p>

                    <h2>c. From Voltaire to Rousseau</h2>
                    <p>On the one side ideas, on the other feelings and moods. These are the twin
                        components of Brandes’ system. In <em>Main Currents</em> they appear as two
                        historical principles that feed into one another. The two principles are
                        also baptized: Voltaire and Rousseau.</p>
                    <p>Employing his usual sense for synthesis and mediation, the intellectual life
                        of the 18th century is boiled down to “the principle of freedom or of
                        brotherhood” represented respectively by Voltaire’s rationalism and
                        Rousseau’s feeling. In <em>Emigrant Literature</em> the reaction began with
                        Madame de Staël’s shift from Voltaire to Rousseau, with the reaction of
                        feeling against reason (Brandes 1872:167). In <em>The Reaction in
                            France</em> the development is completed with the Church’s reaction
                        against feeling. History thus winds its way through the Kingdom or Reason
                        through the Kingdom of Feeling toward the authority principle (Brandes
                        1874:101). </p>
                    <p>It is important to take notice of the linear development of thought. The
                        authority principle does not merely assert power and submission in the world
                        of ideas, but just as much in the domain of feeling. The whole of the
                        reaction is an attempt to contain an intense feeling, that of revolutionary
                        enthusiasm: </p>
                    <blockquote>And now it is as if all that which the heroes of the intellect have
                        thought and for which they have suffered martyrdom should be able to be
                        shoved aside as useless and futile! As if that which had stirred up the
                        noblest of hearts, that which had infused them with courage on the
                        battlefield and on the scaffold, all that enthusiasm should now be able to
                        be bottled up anew like the genie in the bottle of the fairytale, and that
                        the bottle could be permanently sealed by an Emperor and a Pope! (Brandes
                        1874:87)</blockquote>
                    <p>The denial of the freedom to think by the Empire and the Restoration is just
                        as much a denial of the freedom to feel. In Chateaubriand, Alfred de Vigny
                        and Madame de Krüdener eroticism, for Brandes the most important literary
                        sentiment, withers into a pale and prudish Platonism, or it is
                        moralistically repressed and manifests itself as sin and shame – Eros
                        becomes Satan himself (Brandes 1874:260). In Brandes’ view the renewed
                        Catholic tendency either distorts the emotional experiential world of human
                        beings into religious spiritualism or represses it entirely in the assertion
                        of the authority principle. Whether it is in the form of active enthusiasm
                        and warm-blooded eroticism or the hatred and sin of the reaction, the
                        spectrum of feeling is as important as the spectrum of ideas.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>d. The Emotional-Ideological Basis of History</h2>
                    <p>In Brandes’ evolutionary history, ideas and feelings thus follow one another
                        only to be suppressed by the authority principle. But the historical
                        perspective does not stand alone. As already suggested ideas and feelings
                        constitute the two fundamental components of Brandes’ system, fundamental
                        components that together form a permanent matrix for historical development.
                        Even when feelings are suppressed by the reaction they constitute an
                        essential object of study, in that they represent that which is distorted,
                        garbled and subjugated. Conversely, Brandes criticizes German Romanticism
                        for its moonshine mood and its wallowing in emotion (Brandes 1873:309,215).
                        He thus simultaneously seeks “the concealed feeling and the abstract idea
                        underlying everything” (Brandes 1873:4). Here there is no suggestion of
                        transmission from the one to the other, but of the simultaneous existence of
                        two modes of human psychology. </p>
                    <p> It is easy to read Brandes exclusively as a historian of ideas. The ideas
                        have sharp contours. As a rule they have a clear origin that can be
                        identified and their development can relatively easily be traced. Feelings
                        on the contrary are diffuse and frayed at the edges, and imperceptibly they
                        morph into formless moods that cannot so easily be identified, localized or
                        traced. Here for example is the mood that reigned during the French
                        reaction: “thus the mood of the period, worn out but complex, full of
                        disappointments, expectations and an impulse toward personal reveries, is
                        not a mood conducive to action, but to mediation and contemplation” (Brandes
                        1874:243). Despite its complex and fluid character, however, the emotional
                        element has a decisive explanatory potential, for as Brandes continues: “it
                        is this popular mood that <em>explains</em> how Lamartine’s “Meditations”
                        could become the most beloved poems of the age [italics mine]” (Brandes
                        1874:243). But the moods do not just explain the literary preferences of the
                        period. They are often described as the actual subject of history. An author
                        like Ludwig Börne, for example, is merely a passive medium through which a
                        more foundational emotional energy is channeled: “Börne is here only an
                        organ for a feeling that had seized the largest part of the many in Germany
                        who were receptive to enthusiasm” (Brandes 190:35).</p>
                    <p>In this manner feelings and moods constitute the intangible yet effective raw
                        material of history. Not at all was it the soldiers who drove Napoleon out
                        of Germany in 1813. It was “national feeling” (Brandes 1890:21). And when
                        Brandes describes how Napoleon reestablished the Concordat in 1801, he does
                        not first and foremost point to historical events. He seeks rather a
                        psychological explanation:</p>
                    <blockquote>A change in external circumstances is always prepared by a change in
                        moods and further brings forth still more moods that correspond to the new
                        circumstances. The moods and ideas that prepared the ground for the
                        Concordat were, when it was established, granted full freedom to speak and
                        to call forth similar moods. And since these moods and ideas now expressed
                        themselves in literature, a new literary movement emerged that corresponded
                        to the Concordat, translating it, so to speak, into the language of
                        literature. (Brandes 1874:93-4).</blockquote>
                    <p>Both history and literature are surface phenomena that emerge out of deeper
                        sources – the moods of the period. Brandes often speaks of moods, feelings
                        and ideas in the same sentence, but what is their internal relationship?
                        They are almost always closely entangled with one another. A mood can be a
                        symptom of a pantheistic mindset (Brandes 1875:62), but ideas can also be
                        the product of feelings. Brandes cites the famous assertion by the English
                        poet William Wordsworth that the “influxes of feelings are modified and
                        directed by our thoughts, which are indeed the representations of all our
                        past feelings” (Brandes 1875:72). Here moods exist at a deeper level in the
                        chain of causation, for vague moods gradually take on form and become “more
                        defined moods,” which again crystallize in still clearer “ideas,” which
                        together constitute the conditions for the emergence of the Concordat.
                        However fluid and vague feelings and moods might be, the alloy of emotions
                        and ideas comes to bear a heavy explanatory burden as the ultimate ground of
                        both history and literary hermeneutics. Taken together, moods, feelings and
                        ideas <em>create</em> history and <em>explain</em> literature. What, then,
                        does Brandes call this alloy of emotions and ideas, this psychological force
                        that shapes history and structures his entire work of literary history? He
                        calls them currents.</p>

                    <h2>e. Streams, Rivers, Channels</h2>
                    <p>The original title of the lecture series was <em>Fundamental Currents in 19th
                            Century Literature</em>. Because Brandes’ teacher Hans Brøchner did not
                        care for this title, Brandes replaced “fundamental currents” with the now
                        well-known “main currents” (Fenger 1957:211-12). Brandes did not just
                        maintain the metaphor, he also expanded its semantic field to a larger
                        complex of metaphors. Moods, feelings and ideas flow along in broad streams
                        through rivers and thousands of channels, they break down into vortexes,
                        ferment in swamps, divide themselves into surface and undercurrents, they
                        burst the dikes of the reaction or determine its countercurrent. Brandes
                        speaks of “the revolutionary current” (Brandes 1872:14), “the mental current
                        of the age” (Brandes 1882:448) and “the course of the intellectual currents”
                        (Brandes 1882:50). Together the multitude of currents make up the fluid
                        material that binds together Brandes’ analyses and permits him to postulate
                        connections between a series of often loosely related authors and
                        events.</p>
                    <p>In the introduction to the second volume, <em>The Romantic School in
                            Germany</em>, he explicitly formulates the premise and the approach of
                        the work: “The method consists, as is known to the reader, in
                        psychologically tracing the deeper movements in literature from country to
                        country, showing how now and then the fluid material is compressed,
                        crystallizing in one or another clearly defined type” (Brandes 1873:19).
                        Here Brandes articulates a hydraulic literary theory, in which literature
                        and its characters are manifestations in more stable form of the moods,
                        feelings and ideas that flow across national boundaries. Thus he writes of
                        Chateaubriand’s German-influenced 1802 short story <em>René</em>: “again the
                        thoughts and feelings flow back over the borders of France, and on French
                        ground this river is called René” (Brandes 1872:38). Furthermore, the
                        central object of Brandes’ research, the literary schools, are themselves
                        products of such aquatic convergences. The Romantic school in France, for
                        example, emerges from the efforts of a number of authors “to exchange with
                        youthful haste their ideas, inform each other of their hatreds, their
                        sympathies and antipathies. And this profusion of feelings flows together in
                        brooks that form a river” (Brandes 1882:22). The task of the comparatist –
                        the new possibility offered by the comparative analysis of literature – is
                        precisely to describe, through the crystals that make up literature and its
                        schools, the currents that lie beneath them and that give them form and
                        clarity.</p>
                    <p>So moods, feelings and ideas flow. They flow together and form schools, they
                        flow geographically back and forth between the European countries, but they
                        also flow through time. The many intricate water metaphors are organized by
                        an overriding historical-dialectical schema of Hegelian appearance. The
                        question is are how Hegel’s philosophy of history coheres with the French
                        aesthetics of Sainte-Beuve and Taine, and with the ontology inherent in
                        Brandes’ pervasive water metaphorics.</p>

                    <p>It is unsurprising that <em>Main Currents</em> has many Hegelian traits.
                        Hegelianism predominated at the University of Copenhagen in the 1860s, and
                        Brandes’ teacher Hans Brøchner was himself strongly influenced by it. The

                        was shaped by Hegelian ideas is most clearly apparent from a note in his
                        diary on October 4th, 1861, written after his first reading of Hegel’s
                            <em>Encyclopedia</em> (1817): “Blessed beyond compare to study this, to
                        kiss this book, altogether intoxicated by it” (Dagbog 1861-3:119). His
                        enthusiasm cooled over the years, yet the historical-dialectical manner of
                        thinking, in which actions lead to reactions and further to new actions and
                        thereby drive forward the idea of freedom slowly but surely, is indeed
                        employed by Brandes as the frame of <em>Main Currents</em>. In the sixth
                        volume he describes Hegelianism as such: “world history was one continuous
                        drama, one great drama of freedom” (Brandes 1890:310). It is precisely as a
                        Hegelian drama of freedom that Brandes stages <em>Main Currents</em> from
                        the very beginning. Actions and reactions contain their own antitheses, and
                        when a movement becomes suitably strong it compels the reversal with the
                        force of “historical necessity” (Brandes 1873:377). </p>
                    <p>As Gunnar Ahlström noticed early on, Brandes adopted the German historian
                        G.G. Gervinus’ <em>Geschichte des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts seit den Weiner
                            Verträgen</em> (1855-66) as a model (Ahlström 1937:46-54). Beyond
                        borrowing the concept of “emigrant literature,” Brandes appropriated –
                        without acknowledgment – Gervinus’ overall account of how the revolutionary
                        potential drowned in reactionary Romanticism, and how these circumstances
                        prevailed until the Byronic reversal. But more than that: He also borrowed
                        Gervinus’ Hegelian scheme of literary historical development along with his
                        metaphorics of water. As Gervinus writes in his introductory volume,
                            <em>Einleitung in die Geschichte des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts</em>,
                        which had appeared a few years prior, the macro-historical perspective
                        provides insight into the fundamental patterns of movement in history:</p>
                    <blockquote>All history, when it is observed in a shorter time span, moves in a
                        uniform manner formed by certain reigning influences. Looked at in longer
                        periods it draws a picture of continuous vacillation between incongruous
                        driving forces that counteract every instance of the predominance of a
                        single idea by virtue of a governing power or movement. When we look at
                        entire centuries, a steady current in a specific direction, the unmistakable
                        progress of a reigning idea, emerges out of this ebb and flow. (Gervinus
                        1853:12) </blockquote>
                    <blockquote> [Alle Geschichte, in kleineren Zeiträumen betrachtet, bewegt sich
                        in einem gleichartigen Charakter, der von bestimmten vorherrschenden
                        Einflüssen gestaltet wird. In grössere Perioden zusammengefasst, gewährt sie
                        das Bild steter Schwankungen zwischen entgegengesetzten Antrieben, die allem
                        Uebergewichte einer einzelnen Idee, einer leitenden Macht oder Bewegung
                        zuwiderwirken. Ganz im grossen Verlaufe der Jahrhunderte überschaut, ist
                        dann wieder in diesem Wechsel von Ebbe and Flut eine stete Strömung nach
                        einer bestimmten Richtung, der Fortschritt einer herrschenden Idee ganz
                        unverkennbar]. </blockquote>
                    <p>There are indeed many ideas and metaphors that have flowed from Gervinus into
                        Brandes’ <em>Main Currents</em>. In Brandes the bodies of water in his many
                        streams, rivers and channels even flow in precisely the same manner; he
                        finds “the norm of the movements” in the “great rhythm of ebb and flow”
                        (Brandes 1890:571).</p>
                    <p>Coupled with the teleological understanding of history as the revelation of
                        the idea of freedom, one could therefore easily be lead to view all the
                        metaphorical water that runs through <em>Main Currents</em> as a
                        metaphysical entity, as Gervinus’ and thereby Brandes’ visualization of the
                        Hegelian Geist (see for example Lundtofte 2003:102). In a later newspaper
                        article Brandes himself makes the link:</p>
                    <blockquote>When I began work on <em>Main Currents</em> in 1871, I was still
                        metaphysically minded in my intellectual orientation. I overlooked the
                        personalities; they were for me only the organs of the ideas. As the title
                        suggested, it was only the currents within the world of ideas that
                        interested me. The individual personalities were carried by the currents,
                        swept along by them; they were mouthpieces for the ideas. Their
                        personalities were not of interest to the author. (Brandes
                        1887)</blockquote>
                    <p> It wasn’t quite that simple. Because of a dispute over the rights to the
                        German edition of <em>Main Currents</em>, it was now in Brandes’ interest to
                        draw the largest possible contrast between Strodtmann’s original translation
                        and his own later translation, in which he had made a number of revisions
                        and toned down the Hegelian vocabulary. Moreover, in his dissertation from
                        1870, Brandes had devoted himself to recent French aesthetics and in
                        particular to Hippolyte Taine’s attempt to replace speculative metaphysics
                        with an empirically based scientific approach to literature. Rather than a
                        manifestation of a metaphysical rationality, literature, according to this
                        understanding, was conceived as the natural product formed by three
                        elements: “race,” “milieu” and “moment.” In other words history was a
                        product of a concrete culture, of the mentality that reigned at a given
                        point in time. Literature, for its part, emerged as a monument to “the
                        manner in which human beings have felt and thought many centuries prior”
                        (Taine 1866:iii) [la façon don’t les hommes avaient senti et pensé il y a
                        plusieurs siècles]. In his dissertation Brandes summarizes Taine’s
                        fundamental insight: “the purpose of literature is to sketch out and to
                        preserve feelings,” and thereby “history is at its base an examination of
                        the soul.” (Brandes 1903:13:247).</p>
                    <p>Brandes had his reservations, yet he was persuaded by Taine’s more worldly
                        approach to literature. Not speculative idealism, but empirical science
                        became Brandes’ model. When in the final volume (Young Germany) he arrives
                        at Hegel, he must demonstrate that Hegel’s system “has collapsed and that
                        the all too delicate instrument of its methodology has broken apart in our
                        hands, such that only a few great fundamental thoughts remain”(Brandes
                        1890:310). In <em>Main Currents</em> Brandes thus modifies the Hegelian
                        frame. On the one hand, he needs the Hegelian dialectic to bind the whole
                        work together; thus the repeated invocations of actions and reactions and
                        the internal necessity of development. On the other hand, Brandes’ currents
                        become steadily less commensurate with Hegel’s ontology and metaphysics as
                        the work progresses.</p>
                    <p>But not even in the first volume of <em>Main Currents</em> do we find a
                        metaphysical rationality driving history forward. When Brandes states
                        directly what the metaphor of the current refers to, he repeatedly points to
                        the reigning moods, feelings and ideas of a given period. In other words he
                        appropriates Hegel’s scheme as a formal concept, as a drama that provides
                        him with a structure and a plot, but he empties it of metaphysical content
                        and replaces it with emotions and concrete social and political ideas. The
                        rhythmic ebb and flow of historical movement certainly recalls Hegel’s
                        dialectic, but in contrast to the metaphysical water in Gervinus the
                        fluctuating bodies of water that flow through <em>Main Currents</em> consist
                        of empirical individuals’ natural psychology.</p>

                <div>
                    <h2>g. Metaphors Without Content</h2>
                    <p>It is a curious theoretical construct: French content in German form, an
                        empirical history of literature, culture and mentalities encased within a
                        historical-dialectical corset. Its complex nature also manifests itself on
                        the metaphorical plane. Other metaphors taken from zoology and botany are
                        quite frequently blended with the currents. Comparing his perspective to
                        that of the “intrepid eye of the natural scientist and the physician,”
                        Brandes botanizes literature, describing the “soil” from which literary
                        works sprout and employing it as a thermometer to measure “the temperature
                        of the whole emotional life of an age” (Brandes 1873:6; 1875:31; 1874:251).
                        Natural science is the model for the concrete praxis of literary analysis.
                        Despite their larger movements, the streams, rivers and channels are thus
                        more important for the frame Brandes erects than for his analyses. As the
                        work progresses, the water metaphorics is employed less and less, and when
                        it does appear, it is typically in the introductions and the concluding
                        summaries. Thus the fourth volume concludes with an exercise in dizzying
                        aquatic acrobatics:</p>
                    <blockquote>European poetry was flowing on like a sluggish, smooth river; those
                        who walked along its banks found little for the eye to rest on. All at once,
                        as a continuation of the stream, appeared this poetry, under which the
                        ground so often gave way that it precipitated itself in cataracts from one
                        level to another – and the eyes of all inevitably turn to that part of a
                        river where its stream becomes a waterfall. In Byron’s poetry the river
                        boiled and foamed, and the roar of its waters made music that mounted up to
                        heaven. In its seething fury it formed whirlpools, tore itself and whatever
                        came in its way, and in the end undermined the very rocks. But, “in the
                        midst of the infernal surge,” sat such an Iris as the poet himself has
                        described in <em>Childe Harold</em> – a glorious rainbow, the emblem of
                        freedom and peace – invisible to many , but clearly seen by all who, with
                        the sun above them in the sky, place themselves in the right position. It
                        presaged better days for Europe. (Brandes 1875:526-7)</blockquote>
                    <p>The reader, who after five hundred pages has forgotten the central metaphor
                        of <em>Main Currents</em>, is here thrown into the river. It soon becomes
                        clear, however, that Brandes is compensating for the absence of the water
                        metaphorics throughout the work. In the literary analyses he is rarely
                        interested in specific influences. When he occasionally points to concrete
                        authors and works as sources of inspiration for the works of other authors,
                        he often dissolves philological accuracy in the abstract concept of the
                        current. The river that acquired the name of Réne in France as noted above,
                        is none other than Goethe’s Werther.</p>
                    <p>Even though the current plays a wholly decisive role for the cohesion of
                        Brandes’ project, it is a category without much analytic value. The works
                        are often analyzed as independent artefacts that may well provide an open
                        window on to the general atmosphere of moods, feelings and ideas, yet their
                        specific referents and concrete connections to literary history rarely form
                        a part of his large gestures. Chateaubriand’s <em>Le genie du
                            christianisme</em> [<em>The Genius of Christianity</em>] from 1802, for
                        example, becomes “the book of the moment” in that it “in the wrappings of
                        sentimentality smuggled in the authority principle that would soon mount the
                        throne” (Brandes 1874:135).</p>
                    <p>But Brandes is not interested in substantiating his assertion of “its
                        colossal success and immense influence” (Brandes 1874:134). Instead he
                        devotes thirty pages to a sarcastic critique of the Christian conservative
                        ideas in Chateaubriand’s epic The Martyrs, or the Triumph of the Christian
                        Religion [Les Martyrs, ou Le triomphe de la religion chrétienne] from 1809,
                        where Brandes acting the engaged and polemic literary critic is truly in his
                        element (Brandes 1874:171-202). Accordingly he viewed traditional philology
                        with a skepticism bordering on arrogance. Through Paul Heyse he encountered
                        the professor of literature Michael Bernays, whose career had been built
                        upon the strictly philological method. It is difficult to miss Brandes’
                        contempt in his characterization of him:</p>
                    <blockquote>He had cleansed Goethe’s Werther of all original as well as later
                        typographical errors, just as Madvig had cleansed Livius of scribal errors.
                        He was the most passionate admirer of Goethe, and since he was equipped with
                        the memory of a mnemonist, he could recite <em>Egmont</em> or
                            <em>Iphigenie</em> by heart from end to end, not to mention the ballads
                        or the lesser poems. He knew exactly where every sentence one might cite was
                        found in Goethe. (Brandes 1907:136)</blockquote>
                    <p>This kind of micrology was for lesser intellects than Brandes. He gladly left
                        to others the arduous work of tracking down concrete connections, influences
                        and developments and documenting them with detailed empirical evidence and
                        philological minutiae. The current is the category of macro-history and
                        broad developments and as such it is best reserved for introductions and
                        conclusions. In between lie the literary works, like well-demarcated islands
                        on which Brandes can botanize. </p>

                    <h2>h. The Current and the Genius</h2>
                    <p>The relationship between the broad currents and the individual authors is
                        therefore precarious. Do the authors exclusively articulate the feelings and
                        the ideas carried along by the currents? Or are they also autonomous
                        individuals who themselves set the course? In other words, how strong is the
                        current in Brandes’ <em>Main Currents</em>? </p>
                    <p>In his correspondence with Heyse Brandes, as mentioned above, had maintained
                        that the currents were more important than the individuals, because every
                        author is conditioned by the age. Yet Heyse’s defense of the individual
                        ultimately shook Brandes’ philosophical determinism, awakening within him a
                        slumbering yet passionate individualism (Brandes 1907:128). This account is
                        found in the second volume of Brandes’ memoirs, and naturally it is written
                        in retrospect. After his engagement with Nietzsche in the late 1880s
                        individual genius becomes much more prominent in his thinking, as evidenced
                        in his later monographs on, for example, Shakespeare, Goethe and Julius
                        Caesar. In <em>Main Currents</em>, however, especially in the first volume,
                        genius is pushed to the side. According to Kant’s definition the genius is
                        the one who breaks an existing rule and thereby sets a new one (Kant
                        2001:193-4). But in Brandes the authors are captive to the currents, which
                        are so strong that “even characters with such a natural inclination to
                        revolt as Ibsen have been submerged in them” (Brandes 1872:25-6). The
                        genius, who exists outside the artistic tradition and does not draw
                        sustenance from it, remains isolated and wastes away. Even though Brandes
                        acknowledges the singular artistic talents of Heinrich von Kleist and Percy
                        Bysshe Shelley, they fall outside the history of ideas and feelings he
                        outlines. Whereas Hegel’s famous thesis of “the cunning of reason” asserted
                        that reason allowed its battles to be fought out by individuals while it
                        itself remained securely in the background, in Brandes it is the underlying
                        currents of ideas and feelings that determine the emotional and ideological
                        manifestations of the concrete literary work. Feelings are first experienced
                        en masse, before they are experienced individually.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, the power of the current is limited. Already in his
                        dissertation Brandes had criticized Taine for “overlooking the remarkable
                        spontaneous power of the individual genius” (Brandes 1870:110). There is
                        therefore a certain weakness in the argumentation of <em>Main Currents</em>
                        when we survey the entire work: the authors articulate the feelings of the
                        period, but the period is possessed of precisely the feelings articulated by
                        the authors. By means of this circular logic the historical
                        representativeness of the literary feelings is simultaneously secured and
                        undermined. Despite his programmatic theoretical proclamations, Brandes
                        often formulates his thoughts ambiguously. Madame de Staël channels the
                        moods and feelings of the period, yet she is also the literary source of the
                        reaction in French intellectual life (Brandes 1874:350). The independent
                        powers of the individual are seen most clearly in the position Brandes
                        attributes to Byron. From the very beginning of the lecture series he
                        functions as the decisive peripety of the grand drama, as Brandes later
                        formulates it: “An Englishman such as Byron was required to single-handedly
                        stem the tide flowing from the Holy Alliance” (Brandes 1875:20). The English
                        poet on the one side, the current of the reaction on the other.</p>
                    <p>That Byron was not just a medium for broader feelings and moods but himself
                        produced them is clear from the analysis. Of all the oeuvres Brandes treats
                        in <em>Main Currents</em>, no other encompasses the spectrum of feelings and
                        the intensity of their articulation than that of Byron. Withdrawn melancholy
                        vacillates with choleric explosions of ire and indignation. Of course Byron
                        writes against the foil of the Greek Revolution, but is by virtue of “the
                        fearsome outburst of revolutionary anger” in his poetry that he inaugurates
                        the counter-reaction that constitutes the turning point (Brandes 1875:515).
                        Rather than being the product of a current, Byron himself sets a river in
                        motion. Brandes compares him to the English philosopher Jeremy Bentham who
                        had tried to undermine the reaction by speaking to human interests. Byron is
                        much more effective. Because he “let loose all the passions” he was able to
                        “revolutionize minds” (Brandes 1874:349). The broad current again reveals
                        its importance, but now it is the result of literature and not the other way
                        around.</p>
                    <p>The Byronic reversal is therefor also a reversal in the relationship between
                        literature and history. As Brandes writes of the reaction in the third
                        volume, its literature could not cope with the powerful feelings the
                        Napoleonic wars had awakened. The greatest <em>Iliad</em> of the age was
                        Napoleon’s series of victories and defeats; the invasion of Russia its
                        greatest tragedy (Brandes 1874:163). In Byron, literature for the first time
                        returns as the source of feelings that can equal and even exceed those of
                        history. The reversal thus marks the high point not only in the larger plot
                        of the unfolding of freedom, but also in the theory that the individual and
                        literature – in other words, the author – is possessed of an independent
                        spontaneous power: that the author and not the current is the true subject
                        of history.</p>

                    <h2>i. Operative Literary History</h2>
                    <p>In <em>Main Currents</em> Brandes is never able to escape the circularity
                        between the authors and the currents, the particular and the universal.
                        Literary works appear both as the encapsulation of the age as well as the
                        source of new moods, feelings and ideas. In different ways, Hegel and Taine
                        had given him the tools that made it possible to erect the scaffolding of a
                        grandiose comparative project, but its execution also reveals Brandes’
                        increasing aversion to his own construction, to the main currents that
                        organized European literature and consigned the literary work and the author
                        to secondary roles as merely well articulated but passive
                        intermediaries.</p>
                    <p>Over time, his understanding of the relative strength of the current and the
                        individual, as previously noted, evolved into “its opposite” (Brandes 1887),
                        thus resulting in efforts to loosen the Hegelian corset. But this unresolved
                        conflict is present already in the early volumes of the 1870s. As he worked
                        on <em>The Reaction in France</em> in 1873, the tension between his
                        philosophical and his political-aesthetic persuasions was palpable. From
                        Munich he wrote home to Hans Brøchner, decrying that it was the lot of human
                        beings to rise or fall on one of the waves of world history, especially if
                        one found oneself atop a wave about to sink (Brandes 1907:143-4). But at the
                        same time Brandes was troubled by the contemporary forces of reaction, and
                        thus attempted to agitate against them in his merciless excoriation of the
                        authority principle. The introductory lecture of <em>Main Currents</em> also
                        makes clear the real aim of the entire project: “the major part of the work
                        will involve opening up a multiplicity of channels through which can flow
                        the streams and currents that have their origin in the revolution and the
                        age of progress, thereby putting a stop to reaction in all those areas in
                        which its task has historically come to an end” (Brandes 1872:28).</p>
                    <p>Brandes’ version of literary history is not descriptive but operative. The
                        role of the critic is not that of describing, but of productively organizing
                        history in order to put it to use. Like the artist who gives form to the
                        material or the engineer who builds dykes and dams, the critic must shape
                        literary history into currents that flow so powerfully that they can break
                        into the present and transform it. Brandes’ hydraulic model now acquires a
                        different function. Hydraulics, as is known, signifies not only a technical
                        discipline that describes the movement and pressure of liquids – as Brandes
                        describes the movements in the energies of the European states of mind. It
                        is also a concrete technical contraption, in which liquids are used to
                        transfer pressure and energy. It is just such a technical contraption
                        Brandes constructs in <em>Main Currents</em>. Despite the deterministic
                        philosophy it is not the main currents in themselves, but the <em>Main
                            Currents</em> as written by Georg Brandes that must stem the tide of
                        reaction.</p>
                    <p><em>The Reaction in France</em> is – like <em>Main Currents</em> on the whole
                        – an incitement to action. The model is precisely the poet who thirty years
                        prior had set the reversal in motion. Just as Byron with his literature had
                        revolutionized minds with indignation and enthusiasm, so Brandes wants to
                        revolutionize his own age with his comparative literary history. And again
                        as with Byron feelings are the means. When Brandes recounts 1848 he does not
                        merely seek to describe “the emotional life and the wealth of moods of the
                        revolutionary years.” He also wants to “place the reader inside them”
                        (Brandes 1890:563). According to an aesthetic theory Brandes sketches rather
                        quickly in the final volume, the value of art rests on</p>
                    <blockquote>the originality and the strength of that inner life and those
                        palpitations of the mind of which the work is an expression, combined with
                        with the capacity of the work to infect us with them (Brandes
                        1890:50).</blockquote>
                    <p>The measure of literature as well as of literary criticism is their capacity
                        to infect the reader with feelings. Thus the metaphor of the drama takes on
                        a different meaning than the purely plot-oriented and structural function.
                        As in Aristotle’s theory of the impact of tragedy on the spectator, the six
                        acts of <em>Main Currents</em> must provoke in the reader a number of
                        feelings, if not fear and pity, then contempt for the reaction and
                        enthusiasm for the idea of revolution and its realization in the present.
                            <em>Main Currents</em> is itself a balancing act between between
                        historical-dialectical teleology and individual autonomy: The work channels
                        the currents of the past into the quagmire of the present, but Brandes must
                        at the same time actively shape history in opposition to the feelings and
                        ideas of his own age, in order to effectuate the revolution of the mind
                            <em>Main Currents</em> is intended to bring about. The reader can
                        already sense the enthusiasm for this revolution toward the conclusion of
                        the third act of Brandes’ drama, for in <em>The Reaction in France</em>
                        Brandes channels the idea and the feeling of freedom safely through the dark
                        years of the emergence, diffusion, fall and dissolution of the authority
                        principle. “Finally this principle falls, never to rise again,” Brandes
                        proclaims in conclusion (Brandes 1874:352). The way was paved for Byron, for
                        English Naturalism and for the great reversal in Europe’s political,
                        emotional and literary currents.</p>

                    <h2>a. Denmark</h2>
                    <p>If Brandes had believed that the publication of <em>The Reaction in
                            France</em> constituted an action that would revolutionize the Danish
                        public, he was disappointed. He did have good reason to expect a certain
                        amount of attention, however. Leading journals in Germany, England and
                        France had discussed the first volume quite positively, and he himself felt
                        that recognition would be forthcoming in his homeland. But when the third
                        volume appears on February 13th, 1874, it is largely greeted with silence.
                        Only two reviews appeared in Denmark. In April the critic at <em>Berlingske
                            Tidende</em> praises the book for its lively presentation, for its
                        wealth of detail and for its review of the literature, but politically he
                        cannot sanction Brandes’ critique of the authority principle. “No state, not
                        even the freest,” according to the reviewer, can “do without authority,” and
                        thus Brandes’ book constitutes an incitement to “anarchy” and “terrorism”
                        (anon. 1874:1-3). Six months later the second and last contemporary Danish
                        review appeared in <em>Fyens Stiftstidende</em>. It follows in the footsteps
                        of the critic at <em>Berlingske</em>, acknowledging Brandes’ immense
                        knowledge, but distancing itself from his, in the opinion of the reviewer,
                        one-sided and superficial characterization of the authority principle.
                        Nearly twenty years pass before Sophus Schandorph attempts to push back
                        against the critical reception with a highly descriptive and hardly
                        insightful, yet at the same time effusive review of the second revised
                        edition in <em>Tilskueren</em>. Schandorph, who “in all essence shares the
                        author’s view of literature,” painstakingly goes through the content of the
                        volume and Brandes’ formulations in an effort, through the power of
                        repetition, to overcome “all the resistance this work has faced” – a
                        resistance he chiefly ascribes to narrow-mindedness “and that sweet Danish
                        preeminent characteristic: envy” (Schandorph 1893:490).</p>

                    <h2>b. Abroad</h2>
                    <p>Once again Brandes draws greater attention outside of Denmark. Whereas the
                        Danish Brandes is jeered for his politicization or passed over in silence,
                        the European Brandes is of a different stature. In Sweden he is praised for
                        his presentation (see anon. 1874, <em>Aftonbladet</em>; anon. 1874, <em>Ny
                            illustrerad Tidning</em>), while in Norway for his method that breaks
                        with speculative criticism and places the work in its historical context
                        (see anon. 1877). The largest measure of attention, however, was in Germany.
                        Despite the painful marital situation Strodtmann is hard at work, and
                        already in April the first three volumes appear in German as a single
                        edition. The journal <em>Deutsche Rundschau</em> is the first to publish a
                        complete review, praising not just the presentation but also Brandes’
                        distinctive method, his wholly original manner of writing literary history.
                        Instead of approaching the works bibliographically or employing philology
                        and genealogy to trace their internal development, the reviewer writes,
                        Brandes focuses on the “restless mental labor” and the main changes in moods
                        and mental currents” that condition the development of literature (Kreyssig
                        1874:140) [“rastlose Gedankenarbeit,” “die maßgebenden Stimmungswechsel und
                        Geistesströmungen”].</p>
                    <p>Despite the accolades there are also critical voices. Overall the German
                        critics praise <em>The Reaction in France</em> at the expense of the
                        previous volume on German Romanticism. Brandes is accused, not entirely
                        incorrectly, of a thinly veiled Francophilia that disfigures his reading of
                        German literature. Moreover, it is noted that he has taken much of his
                        inspiration from other critics and historians, such as Gervinus (see anon.
                        1874; Jung 1877; Kuh 1876).</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>c. Later Reception</h2>
                    <p>A second wave of reviews appears in the 1890s, this time of all six volumes.
                        These reviews are written in retrospect and are just as concerned with the
                        historical impact of <em>Main Currents</em>. There is general agreement on
                        the enormous significance of the work in Germany. It is presented as an
                        epochal work, decisive for the introduction of Taine’s methods in Germany
                        and the best guide to the European literature of the first half of the 19th
                        century (see anon. 1893; anon. 1894; Morgenstern 1894; Sauer 1898).
                        Especially interesting, however, is Franz Mehring’s judgement in <em>Neue
                            Zeit</em> that the overarching construction of the work does not hold up
                        to closer scrutiny (Mehring 1893-4:311). Some years later, the German
                        literary scholar Samuel Lublinski follows up with a devastating critique of
                        Brandes’ methodology. In 1899 and 1900 Lublinski published <em>Literatur und
                            Gesellschaft im 19. Jahrhundert</em> – the first systematic sociological
                        literary history. Having read review that elevated Brandes at the expense of
                        his own work, Lublinski was quick to respond. He levels his accusation in no
                        uncertain terms: “I contend that Georg Brandes doesn’t know the slightest
                        about <em>fundamental</em> currents. What he does know something about is
                        precisely the opposite – <em>superficial</em> currents” (Lublinski 1900:872)
                        [“Ich behaupte, Georg Brandes hat von <em>Grund</em>strömungen keine Ahnung.
                        Was er kennt, ist das Gegenteil davon: die <em>Ober</em>strömung]. In other
                        words, Brandes has only observed the superficial currents as they appear in
                        literary-political salons. The moods of the salon is all he has analyzed. A
                        fundamental sociological literary history like Lublinski’s is on the
                        contrary concerned with mass phenomena. It dives deep into the intellectual
                        mass psychology of the age in all its manifestations. Lublinski asserts that
                        he himself presents empirical material en <em>masse</em>, while Brandes
                        offers close readings of only a handful of authors and then supplements his
                        readings with anecdotes. Brandes’ conception of Romanticism is thus “as if
                        it had been shot out of a pistol” (Lublinski 1900:873) [Freilich ist bei ihm
                        die Romantik wie aus der Pistole herausgeschossen]. Brandes never shows what
                        the currents actually consist of, how they are connected or how they
                        develop. They remain empty postulates and the slogans of an exclusive group
                        of authors tell us nothing about them.</p>

                    <h2>d. Brandes and Comparative Literature</h2>
                    <p>The critique of the current as a concept and thus of Brandes’ methodology
                        points both sideways and forward. The long gestation period of Main Currents
                        between 1871 and 1890 coincided with the institutionalization of comparative
                        literature as an independent discipline. In 1877 in Hungary Hugo Meltzl
                        founded its first journal, “Comparative Literary Journal” (after 1879
                            <em>Acta Comparationis Litterarum Universarum</em>); in 1886 H.M.
                        Posnett’s book <em>Comparative Literature</em> was published; a year later
                        in Germany Max Koch founded <em>Zeitschrift für vergleichende
                            Literaturgeschichte</em>; and in France the first professorship in
                            <em>Littératures Modernes Comparées</em> was established in 1896 in
                        Lyon. On the other side of the Atlantic a professor at Cornell taught
                        “General and Comparative Literature” from 1871, just as Brandes delivered
                        his first lectures in Copenhagen. And in 1890, the same year the sixth and
                        final volume appeared, the first American Department of Comparative
                        Literature was founded at Harvard University. </p>
                    <p>Given the transnational perspective and broad international impact of
                            <em>Main Currents</em>, Brandes was therefore counted among the founders
                        of the discipline, if not downright “le père du comparatisme” – the father
                        of comparative literature (Madsen 2004:65).</p>
                    <p>Yet the ambivalence that characterized the contemporary reception of Brandes’
                        methodology also manifested itself later on. On the one hand, his
                        originality and ingenuity is credited with opening up a wholly new manner of
                        reading literature. On the other, his concept of the current is criticized
                        as empty and incoherent. Upon Brandes’ death in 1927, Fernand Baldensperger
                        wrote that his work is obsolete “because of the superficial level of its
                        information and because of the all too fragile structure.” (Baldensperger
                        1927:370) [par sa superficialité d’information et par la structure trop
                        légère de sa bâtisse]. And in an echo of Lublinski, René Wellek writes in
                        1955 that the sociology of literature did not lose much with the passing of
                        Georg Brandes. He does indeed possess a large measure of psychological
                        insight and “a power of marshalling currents and movements,” yet Wellek’s
                        final verdict is that Brandes is merely “a middleman without originality and
                        substance” (Wellek 1955:368-9,357).</p>
                    <p>Brandes remains an ambiguous figure in the history of comparative literature.
                        However much he was feted internationally in his time, he and his <em>Main
                            Currents</em> quickly vanished into thin air after his death.
                        Nevertheless, Brandes’ method with the current as its central element, at
                        once maligned and admired, demonstrates an aspect that has remained
                        essential to the field: the necessity of methodological experimentation.</p>
                    <p>When Erich Auerbach, upon the publication in 1946 of his <em>Mimesis:
                            Dargestellte Wirklichkeit in der abendländische Literatur</em>, assumed
                        the status of the central figure in the history of comparative literature,
                        it was by virtue of a work that in various ways differs significantly from
                            <em>Main Currents</em>. Auerbach’s focus is stylistics, and he operates
                        neither with a concept of the current nor with an overarching
                        historical-dialectical frame. Yet like Brandes he lifts his gaze from the
                        national state and adopts a European perspective, and in his own way he
                        attempts in a coupling of minute <em>explications de texte</em> with the
                        contextualization of social history and the history of ideas. And as with
                        Brandes, Auerbach’s key concepts, such as mimesis, representation and
                        reality, are vaguely defined, shape-shifting entities. Nevertheless
                            <em>Mimesis</em> remains a standard reference in the history of the
                        discipline. Auerbach managed to transform the problem of method into a
                        hitherto undiscovered opportunity, namely the synthesis of European literary
                        history across language, geography and time. With this ingenious maneuver,
                        he and comparative literature have an important forerunner in Brandes’
                        currents.</p>

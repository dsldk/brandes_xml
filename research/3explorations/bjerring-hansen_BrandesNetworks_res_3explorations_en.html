                illustrations.</p>

            <h4>Aim</h4>
            <p> Who were the protagonists of 19<aup>th</aup> century European literature? And what are the
                promises and pitfalls when it comes to the modelling of the composition and dynamics
                of historiographical works with the means of network analysis? These are the central
                questions to be addressed and displayed in this poster. </p>
            <h4> Data set </h4>
            <p> The text, to which network analysis is applied, is <em>Main Currents of 19<sup>th</sup> Century
                Literature</em> (6 vols. 1872-1890) by the Danish literary critic Georg Brandes. Tracing
                the course of European thought in the first half of the nineteenth century by
                describing the most important movements in French, German, and English literature,
                it was a highly influential handbook with translations to several languages (German,
                English, French, Polish, Russian etc.), whereby Brandes’ somewhat personal and
                idiosyncratic take on the subject to some extent came to represent a common European
                frame for the understanding of the literature of the recent past (Larsen 2012). In
                1927, Thomas Mann, the German author and Nobel Prize winner, labelled the <em>Main
                Currents ...</em>… “the bible of young, intellectual Europe”. </p>
            <h4> Data organization </h4>
            <p> By a thorough, manual TEI-encoding through philologists establishing a digital
                scholarly edition of the some 3,000 pages work, different opportunities of digital
                explorations have been enabled and facilitated, not least, network analysis. All
                some 2000 historical persons featured in the work are tagged and, furthermore,
                identified to unique IDs, all linked to a relational database with metadata (name,
                year of birth/date, nationality, profession etc.). For this investigation we
                automatically construct an edge between two nodes every time the entity occurs in
                the same paragraph of the text. </p>
            <h4> Analysis </h4>
            <p>On the basis of these highly curated and reliable data, the poster aims to show the
                results of our endeavours to analyse and visualise central and, hopefully, new
                aspects of Brandes’ vast and complex work. More specifically, and along the lines of
                modern historiography (White 1973) we want to explore Brandes’ historical writings
                as texts reliant on strategies of narration and emplotment. Firstly, inspired by
                network studies of dominance relations in dramatic works (Fischer et al 2018) we
                want to identify the central characters in Brandes’ display of nineteenth century
                literature. We will investigate the different common measures for centrality
                (degree, closeness, betweenness, eigenvector): Which are the most appropriate for
                our data and why? What can they tell us that we didn't know beforehand? Secondly,
                and tentatively, following the author’s own characterisation of his work as a “drama
                in six parts” (Brandes 1972, p. 7), we want to study the dynamic composition of the
                six volumes with the help of network analysis, by extracting, visualising, analysing
                and comparing networks of each the six volumes comprising the work, whereby the
                problems of intertwining the static character of networks with the sequentiality of
                narrative will be addressed. Already suggested by Moretti 2011 and in recent time
                discussed and put to use in regards to computational methods (e.g. Fischer et al
                2017), the application of network analysis as a tool for quantitative plot analysis
                has hitherto been restricted to works of fiction. Brandes’ essentially narrative
                approach to the writing of literary history as well as the biographical and
                sociological character of his criticism make such a combination of methods highly
                relevant. </p>

                <p>Presented here are experiments on Brandes's <em>Main Currents ...</em> using structured topic
                    models. Structured topic models, an approach pioneered by Margaret Roberts (UCSD) and Edo
                    Airoldi (Temple University), allows the user to include confounding factors in the
                    creation of topics models. Consequently, models can be explored not only as a simple
                    representation of a standard LDA topic model, but also in the context of one or more
                    confounding factors, such as time, gender of author, or some sort of affiliation of
                    various classes of writers or sources.</p>

            <p> Several browsers based on STM are presented <a href="https://rpubs.com/scandotr/" target="_blank"
                >here</a>. The first two browsers use the mention of Goethe in the
                    <em>Hovedstr√∏mninger</em> chunks as a confounding factor. The remaining three
                browsers allow for the exploration of a series of additional models, with k=84 in
                browser three</p>
            <p>All of these browsers rely on the STMBrowser package developed by Roberts
                (<a href="https://github.com/mroberts/stmBrowser/" target="_blank"
                    >https://github.com/mroberts/stmBrowser</a>). The goal of these approaches are to
                understand how topics vary over various confounding factors, be those factors based
                on time, gender, age, affiliations, or any other possible attribute or feature.
                Additional experiments using STM will be posted as our work develops.</p>

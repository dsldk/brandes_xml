                <h1 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
                <p> If one is to tell the story of Georg Brandes’ education as critic up to his
                    breakthrough in 1871-2 with the appearance of his <em>Emigrant Literature</em>,
                    the first act of the six <em>Main Currents</em>, it is tempting to employ the
                    narrative model of the principal genre of 19th century literature, the bourgeois
                        <em>Bildungsroman</em>. The path of the main character toward becoming
                    himself is here normally portrayed as a process in three phases, involving first
                    a departure from “home” in the form of a journey out into the world, a series of
                    formative experiences, and ultimately a return home to find a place in society.
                    According to the Romantic-Idealist conception of <em>Bildung</em> underpinning
                    the genre, becoming oneself is conceived as the same as reconciling with one’s
                    background, ancestry and milieu. The <em>Bildungsroman</em> thus understands the
                    (self-) construction of the individual as a compromise between one’s own
                    internal drives and the external demands of society.</p>

                <p> Brandes’ life up to <em>Emigrant Literature</em> contains a series of
                    foundational elements: growing up in the bourgeois milieu of Copenhagen,
                    successful university studies and a well-grounded academic education within the
                    prevailing philosophical and literary value system of the era, crowned by a
                    doctorate in aesthetics in 1871. This was followed by a European grand tour in
                    1870 and 1871, which took Brandes to Paris, London, Switzerland and a longer
                    stay in Italy. But the journey did not result in a successful reconciliation
                    with society for Brandes – rather it was the opposite. When Brandes left Denmark
                    in April 1870 he was the great young hope of the literary and academic
                    Parnassus, yet when he returned in July of 1871 he had undergone a series of
                    experiences that brought him into opposition with the local national liberal
                    cultural. The lectures on émigré literature, which should have served as a
                    proving ground for his appointment to the soon to be vacant chair as professor
                    in aesthetics, instead ended up as a polemical attack on the national liberal
                    culture and its fundamental pillars: Christianity, love of the fatherland and
                    marriage as a social institution. It resulted in a confrontation that – for
                    better or worse – sealed his fate and defined the rest of his career. </p>

                <p>In the attempt to reconstruct the series of factors, events and influences that
                    led Brandes toward <em>Emigrant Literature</em>, it is striking the degree to
                    which the desire to rebel and to oppose, as well as a certain sense of
                    martyrdom, was evidently written into his intellectual character from the very
                    beginning. As the eldest son of a clothing wholesaler, Georg Morris Cohen grew
                    up in a secular, bourgeois Jewish home in Copenhagen. During his school years he
                    was the teacher’s pet who shined with his extraordinary gifts and insatiable
                    appetite for book learning, yet at the same time his upbringing also seemed to
                    have imparted the young Brandes with a degree of wariness regarding his Jewish
                    origins – the result of an experience of foreignness and of not being
                    acknowledged as a full member of the society into which he was born (compare
                    Gibbons 1980: 55-60; Knudsen 1985:12-16).</p>
                <p>Recent scholarship has emphasized this paradoxical component of Brandes’ cultural
                    baggage, his intellectual habitat. On the one side, as a modern, secular Jew, he
                    purposely kept his distance from Judaism in its most orthodox variants, but on
                    the other he exhibits a lively interest, throughout a large measure of his
                    authorship, in the role of the Jew in history and in the specifically Jewish
                    contribution to the development of Western culture, in that he saw the Jew as
                    especially well disposed to critical, oppositional and cosmopolitan thinking
                    (Hjortshøj 2017).</p>
                <p>Brandes’ upbringing and family history contain all the ingredients of a modern
                        <em>Bildungsroman</em> about the pathways and choices of life in a 19th
                    century bourgeois family, on the social field encompassing the business world,
                    politics and artistic-literary inclinations. Following his father’s wish,
                    Brandes began as a law student at the university, but quickly abandoned the law
                    to pursue his less practical and potentially unprofitable passion for aesthetics
                    and literature. His father’s business went under in 1861, after which Brandes
                    was compelled more often than not to support himself through various forms of
                    teaching, while at the same time his studies and travels were financially
                    supported by his younger brother Ernst (1844-1892).</p>
                <p>In accordance with family tradition, Ernst had trained in business and had
                    already acquired a significant fortune as a stockbroker by the time at a young
                    age he left the business world in order to work as a journalist and publicist –
                    according to his older brother Georg, this was because as a Jew he was denied a
                    career within the official institutions of the banking industry (Brandes
                    1908:378). In 1889 he took over editorial and financial responsibility for the
                    newspaper <em>Kjøbenhavns Børs-Tidende</em>, a business trade publication, which
                    he attempted to transform into an organ for liberal social debate and critique,
                    despite rising opposition from the paper’s traditional readership. The project
                    ended in tragedy, when burdened by financial problems and a defamation suit
                    against the paper, he chose to take his own life in 1892.</p>

                <p> The youngest brother Edvard Brandes (1847-1931) chose a third career path. After
                    a doctorate in Oriental and Semitic linguistics, he first worked as an author
                    and theater critic, but gradually over time embarked on a long and influential
                    career as newspaper publisher and politician. From 1880 to 1897 he served as
                    member of the Folketing for the liberal Venstre party, which served as the
                    driving force for the transition to full parliamentarianism in Denmark. In 1884
                    he helped found the newspaper <em>Politiken</em>, which became the central organ
                    for the radical, urban and cosmopolitan Copenhagen wing of the Venstre. After
                    this faction broke from the Venstre in 1905, forming the new Radikale Venstre
                    party, Edvard Brandes became one of the chief architects of a modern political
                    program that in numerous essential areas set its mark on the social development
                    of Denmark in the 20th century. At the peak of his political career, he twice
                    served as finance minister in the Radical governments of 1909-10 and 1913-20
                    (Hvidt 2005). </p>
                <p>This brief sketch of the family album reveals how closely Georg Brandes’ life was
                    bound up with modern social development and the radical social and political
                    changes undergone by Danish society at the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.
                    At the same time the tragic fate of the brother Ernst is a reminder of the
                    widespread anti-Semitism and xenophobia in the Danish society of the time, which
                    was also a factor in the story of Georg Brandes as critic and intellectual.</p>

                <p>Brandes’ intellectual and academic years of apprenticeship, which are summarized
                    in detail by Henning Fenger (Fenger 1955, 1957), play out on a field between
                    different disciplines and institutions – between the university and the press,
                    between aesthetics and philosophy, between Danish and European literature. As a
                    student of aesthetics and literature he devoted himself to a comprehensive
                    reading program, encompassing both Goethe, Shakespeare, the Greek tragedians,
                    Homer, and Plato as well as the Romantic poetry of the Danish Golden Age, from
                    Baggesen and Staffeldt through Oehlenschläger to Chr. Winther, Fr.
                    Paludan-Møller, Henrik Hertz and J.L. Heiberg. During the same years he
                    experienced an intellectual and religious crisis under the influence of the
                    philosopher Søren Kierkegaard. Paul V. Rubow has argued that his relation to
                    Kierkegaard, more than anything else, shaped Brandes’ personality (Rubow
                    1932:101-65). According to Rubow, it was the passionate idealism of
                    Kierkegaard’s religious existential thought, together with its uncompromising
                    demand of individual self-realization and personal renewal in opposition to
                    lethargic social norms and majority opinion that appealed to and stimulated
                    Brandes. But a series of other philosophical sources of influence also made an
                    impact on him as his intellectual journey gradually unfolded.</p>
                <p>As a student of literature Brandes quickly established a reputation as one of the
                    most intelligent academics of his generation. In the fall of 1862 he was awarded
                    the university’s gold medal for a treatise on the concept of fate in Greek
                    tragedy, and in the winter of 1864 he was well prepared for his MA defense. The
                    title or the problematic of his exam, which was not chosen by Brandes himself
                    but in accordance with the custom of the time was selected by the faculty, was
                    in full: </p>
                <blockquote>Determine the reciprocal relationship between the pathetic and the
                    symbolic in general, in order thereby to illuminate the contrast between
                    Shakespeare’s tragedies and Dante’s Divine Commedia, along with the possible
                    errors that might result from a one-sided over emphasis on one of these two
                    elements.</blockquote>
                <p>In order to pass the exam, Brandes also had to produce three lesser written
                    exercises on the following – likewise related – themes: “To what extent can
                    poetry be called idealized history?,” “Demonstrate in which manner the
                    philosophical orientation of Spinoza and of Fichte may lead to a misconstruing
                    of the concept of beauty,” and “Demonstrate the relationship of the comic to its
                    limits and its various contradictions” (Dahl 1998:9).</p>
                <p>These themes together provide a potent image of the university and the discipline
                    from which Brandes emerged, whose disciplinary norms and criteria he was to
                    honor in his first academic work. They are comfortably situated within the frame
                    of the idealist and speculative Hegelian aesthetics that functioned at the time
                    as the dominate system for all academic work on literature and in art in
                    Northern Europe. According to this orientation, the physical and sensual world
                    and its phenomena were viewed as materializations of eternally valid abstract
                    ideas and principles. The methodology of speculative aesthetics thus
                    concentrated on relating works of art to abstract concepts such as the beautiful
                    and the noble, the tragic and the comic etc., and thereafter evaluating the
                    concrete works on how well they are in agreement with the concepts. In 1866
                    Brandes embarked on an effort to complete his education within this tradition in
                    the form of a planned dissertation on the theme of “the theory of the comic,”
                    but for the first time in his career he found himself in conflict with
                    speculative aesthetics and the Hegelian system of thought, which up to then had
                    shaped his academic training.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, Brandes had also begun supporting himself as the theater
                    reviewer for the Copenhagen newspaper <em>Dagbladet</em> and the weekly <em>Illustreret
                        Tidende</em>. His contact with these journalistic venues meant that Brandes’
                    prior more theoretical or academic orientation was challenged by new, more
                    worldly and socially engaged interests and questions. The experience is also
                    evident in a stylistic change in his manner of writing, in which the abstract
                    Hegelian conceptual prose yields to a more emphatic and polemical approach. It
                    was in his role as polemicist and social debater that Brandes made his literary
                    debut in 1866 with the pamphlet <em>Dualism in Our Recent Philosophy</em></p>
                <p>The pamphlet was a contribution to the great debate of the time, that on the
                    relation between faith and knowledge, which emerged in the wake of the
                    historical and philological critique of the Bible and of Christianity forwarded
                    by Left Hegelians such as Ludwig Feuerbach (<em>Das Wesen des Christentums</em>,
                    1841) and David F. Strauss (<em>Das Leben Jesu kritisch bearbeitet</em>,
                    1842-3). New life was breathed into the debate in the 1860s with the appearance
                    of the French philosopher Ernest Renan’s <em>La Vie de Jésus</em> (1863, Da.
                        <em>Jesu Levnet</em>, 1864), which on the basis of study of historical
                    sources denied the Christian dogma of the divine nature of Jesus. At the same
                    time the Christian worldview was challenged on a second front in the form of
                    rising natural science and natural history: in his <em>Principles of
                        Geology</em> (1830-3), the English geologist Charles Lyell had presented a
                    positivistic and naturalistic explanation of the lifeforms of the Earth, which
                    contradicted the Christian ur-myth that all present species had initially
                    appeared in their finished forms through a divine act of creation a few thousand
                    years prior. Lyell’s geology was the most important inspiration for Charles
                    Darwin’s doctrines of the origin of species and of slow historical evolution
                    through natural selection, as presented in <em>On the Origin of Species by Means
                        of Natural Selection</em> (1859, Da. <em>Arternes oprindelse</em>,
                    1872).</p>
                <p>The formal occasion for Brandes’ intervention in this discussion involved his
                    earlier teacher at the university, the philosophy professor Rasmus Nielsen. In
                    his <em>Grundidéernes Logik</em> (1864-6), Nielsen had attempted to reconcile
                    the rising gulf between religion and science by arguing that faith and knowledge
                    constitute two essentially distinct domains of human cognition, each of which
                    should respect the limits of the other. In his pamphlet, Brandes objected to the
                    dualism and the indolent spinelessness of this point of view, instead arguing
                    that the dogmas and myths of Christianity must be subjected to the challenges
                    and the corrections of modern geology and biology. In other words, Brandes
                    accepted neither Nielsen’s “philosophy of reconciliation” (Brandes 1866:8) nor
                    his declared truce between the worldly and the spiritual regimes. Instead he
                    argued stridently and confidently for an open confrontation between the two.</p>

                <h1 id="taine">4. Encounter with Hippolyte Taine and Dissertation</h1>
                <p>In the winter of 1866-7, at the same time of the publication of <em>Dualism in
                        Our Recent Philosophy</em>, Brandes took took his first extended study trip
                    to Paris, which would prove to be of decisive significance for his intellectual
                    development. Especially important was his encounter with the French philosopher,
                    historian and literary critic Hippolyte Taine (1828-93). Before the journey,
                    Brandes had already acquainted himself with Taine’s chief work, the grand
                        <em>Histoire de la littérature anglaise</em> (3 vols., 1863-4/66, Da.
                    1874-7), which contained a program for a new, positivist-inspired form of
                    literary history that sought to explain literary works and developments from
                    concepts and principles adopted from the modern natural sciences of geology and
                    biology. But the influence of Taine on Brandes increased quite considerably
                    during his stay in Paris, during which he attended the Frenchman’s lectures on
                    aesthetics at the École des Beaux Arts, so much so that Taine ended up as the
                    theme for Brandes’ doctoral dissertation, <em>French Aesthetics in Our Age</em>
                    (1870).</p>
                <p>There is a measure of agreement among Brandes scholars that his acquaintance with
                    the positivist methodology of Taine should be viewed as the landmark event of
                    his education as critic. Bertil Nolin has thus designated the encounter with
                    Taine as a paradigm shift in Brandes’ aesthetics and critical approach (Nolin
                    1980). This shift can be summarized as a movement away from (German) idealism
                    and metaphysics toward (French) positivism, psychology and cultural history. In
                    contrast to the speculative aesthetics in which Brandes had been trained, Taine
                    represented a different historical view of literature that attempted to explain
                    literary phenomena from the life of the author, the composition of the public
                    and the historical context. For Taine it was not sufficient to discern that a
                    tragedy was a tragedy and lived up to the eternal laws of such. He was more
                    interested in getting to know the man who stood behind the work, and the culture
                    or the civilization that shaped it. The central idea was to view literary works
                    as psychological testimonies of human thoughts and feelings.</p>
                <p>Taine thus emphasized human existence in literary history, yet at the same time
                    argued that the creative abilities of human beings were determined by a series
                    of external cultural, climactic, social and historical factors. In the famous
                    programmatic declaration from the introduction to <em>Histoire de la littérature
                        anglaise</em>, he summarizes these factors as the three foundational forces
                    [forces primordiales] of history: “la race, le milieu, le moment” (Taine
                    1866:XXIII), which can be translated as the people, the environment and the
                    age.</p>
                <p>Taine’s philosophy of history further rested upon the theory, first developed in
                    his treatise on the ancient Roman politician and historian Titus Livius
                        (<em>Essai sur Tite-Live</em>, 1854/6), that all the domains of a given
                    culture – its religion, art, philosophy, industry and family life etc. – can be
                    traced back to a collective cause in the form of a predominate characteristic
                    (“faculté maîtresse”) among the given people. As natural scientist of the soul,
                    the task of the literary historian consisted of mapping the human faculties,
                    abilities and feelings that form the basis of literary history and reveal how
                    these are determined by the previously mentioned foundational forces. All
                    things, including human feelings and passions, must be treated and explained
                    historically: “there is a cause for ambition, for courage, for truth, just as
                    there is for digestion, for muscular movement, for animal heat; vice and virtue
                    are products just as much as vitriol and sugar” (Taine 1866: XV). It was this
                    kind of characteristic formulation from the introduction to Taine’s English
                    literary history that Brandes took to heart and employed in his dissertation
                    (Brandes 1870a:182).</p>
                <p>Taine’s literary history represented an early attempt at an objective and
                    positivistic view of literature, yet at the same time it was strongly marked by
                    the prevailing doctrines of his age, including the Romantic conception of the
                    people as the driving force of history. This is particularly evident in Taine’s
                    far-reaching observations on the differences between the Germanic and the
                    Romance peoples, each of which is governed by peculiar psychological
                    characteristics. Taine further subscribed to the erroneous but prevailing
                    doctrine of the age that the acquired characteristics of a human being can be
                    inherited, which resulted in an unclear and otherwise superficial distinction
                    between the traits of an author that can be attributed to “the race” and those
                    which can more accurately be attributed to environmental influences. This lack
                    of clarity was also implanted in Brandes.</p>
                <p>In his doctoral dissertation, Brandes loyally subscribes to the pillars of
                    Taine’s historical methodology, yet along the way also registers a series of
                    objections against the deterministic and reductive character of the Frenchman’s
                    explanatory model, among others a tendency to reduce poets and poetic works to a
                    predominate capacity and to a summation of the spirit of the age and the race.
                    In this critique of Taine’s determinism, Brandes found significant support in
                    the more privately psychological and personally historical literary criticism of
                    the French critic Charles-Augustin Sainte-Beuve (1804-69). Sainte-Beuve’s
                    profiles of the French Romantics in his book <em>Critiques et portraits
                        littéraires</em> (1832-9) were thus also a direct model for Brandes, when
                    after his dissertation he published a series of his own author portraits,
                        <em>Kritiker og Portraiter</em> (1870).</p>
                <p>The essence of Brandes’ critique of Taine more or less comes down his sense that
                    the theoretical architecture of the Frenchman does not to a sufficient degree
                    provide space for the individual and for creative genius, and thereby not at all
                    for the kind of hero worship that over time became a steadily more prominent
                    driving force in Brandes’ own critical methodology. Yet this disagreement also
                    points toward an important difference between the two regarding their
                    conceptions of history itself. Whereas Taine is occupied with the long, nearly
                    unchangeable lines in the formation of national identity – or what the 20th
                    century French Annales school of historical science would come to call the
                    “longue durée” of historical time (Braudel 1997:151-2), Brandes’ more impatient
                    and combative attitude was better oriented toward dramatic rupture and renewal
                    in history. If the key words of Taine were nation and civilization, for Brandes
                    they are rupture and revolution.</p>
                <p>That the Tainean turn in Brandes’ theoretical development has previously been
                    described as a transition from (German) idealism and Hegelianism toward (French)
                    positivism is thus only conditionally true. In his conception of history Brandes
                    remained a child of Hegel’s dialectical method and philosophy of history as
                    developed in the German philosopher’s lectures on the subject (<em>Vorlesungen
                        über die Geschichte der Philosophie</em>, 1819-32, published 1833-6). Hegel
                    here portrays world history as a continuous narrative of the progressive
                    penetration of human reason and freedom into the world through the steady
                    movements of ideas (theses), which encounter their opposites (antitheses) and
                    thereafter are sublated in a higher synthesis. It is this dialectic and this
                    conception of history that forms the ground for the literary historical drama of
                    Main Currents, which is staged as a struggle between the principles of
                    revolution and reaction.</p>

                <h1 id="portraits">5. Portraits of H.C. Andersen and M.A. Goldschmidt. In Search of
                    a Literary Psychology of Race</h1>

                <p>From his theater reviews and literary portraits from the period following his
                    stay in Paris, we can see how Brandes attempts to bring Taine’s concepts into
                    play. Two of the most express examples are the treatments of H.C. Andersen and
                    M.A. Goldschmidt, each a central yet quite distinctive figure from the Late
                    Romantic Danish Golden Age. The two essays can be simultaneously read as a
                    reflection on Brandes’ own ambivalent relation to his double identity as a
                    Danish Jew at a time when fashionable opinion in Denmark moved steadily in a
                    more national direction. In the treatment of the national poet H.C. Andersen,
                    Brandes attempts to explain the secret of his popular tales with reference to
                    the author’s affection and empathy for “childlike imagination and childlike
                    feeling” (Brandes 1870b:323), while identifying the “foundational idyllic tone”
                    in Andersen as particularly Danish (Brandes 1870b:345). Brandes here was on the
                    trail of the poetic “naiveté” and the presence “of childishness in the national
                    character” that later, in the introduction to <em>Emigrant Literature</em>, yet
                    here for the purpose of parody, is identified positively as a peculiarity of
                    Danish culture (Brandes 1872a:17).</p>
                <p>The counterpoint to Andersen is the Jewish author M.A. Goldschmidt, the strange
                    bird of Danish Golden Age literature, who in the manner of Taine is categorized
                    as a “stylist” and an “eclectic” – a predominate characteristic that is
                    explained with reference to the author’s Jewish origins. On the strength of his
                    Jewish characteristics, Goldschmidt had been able to assimilate to Danishness
                    and to contribute to creating a modern Danish prose style, but at the same time,
                    Brandes argues, he maintained an unfortunate inclination toward mysticism and to
                    playing the coquette with his Jewish background. This leads Brandes toward a few
                    general observations regarding the question of “the task of the Jew in modern
                    culture” (Brandes 1870b:399). He notes the strong Jewish presence in
                    contemporary European music and literature, citing – as a counterpoint to
                    Goldschmidt – the German Jewish composer Giacomo Meyerbeer (1791-1854) as an
                    example of an artist who “manifests his Jewish origins in something
                    cosmopolitan, something eclectic, which leads him to reconcile Romance and
                    Germanic peculiarities” (Brandes 1870b:400).</p>
                <p>The citations introduce a recurrent theme in his authorship, namely the
                    connection between Jewish identity and modern cosmopolitanism, as well as the
                    conception of the modern European Jew as a historical type particularly disposed
                    to play the role of mediator between national cultures. For Brandes the modern
                    European Jew was possessed of the immense advantage of not being weighed down or
                    burdened by a “home” and thus by a defined national inheritance and tradition.
                    On the one hand this amounted to a tragic experience, but on the other it
                    simultaneously rendered him especially well disposed to intellectual mobility,
                    cultural renewal and secular freethinking. As Brandes formulated it, the modern
                    Jew was a “son of Spinoza . . . polemically inclined from birth against every
                    form of European narrow-mindedness, oppositional, free born and born for
                    scientific observation and poetic re-presentation” (Brandes 1870b:401). </p>
                <p>As Henry J. Gibbons has proposed, there is also an element of the self-portrait
                    in Brandes’ characterization of the modern Jew as cultural reformer (Gibbons
                    1980:60-1). We rediscover the same figure in the introduction to <em>Emigrant
                        Literature</em>, in which Brandes makes a point of emphasizing that the most
                    progressive poets of Young Germany, Heinrich Heine, Ludwig Börne and Berthold
                    Auerbach (Brandes 1872a:14), were all of Jewish descent. The influence of Taine
                    in this way also made Brandes newly aware of his own identity as a Jew – an
                    ethnic identification that up to then had only played a subordinate role in his
                    self-understanding.</p>

            <div class="chapter">
                <h1 id="paris">6. Grand Tour of 1870-1: Paris</h1>

                <p>In April of 1871 Brandes embarked on a grand tour through France, England,
                    Switzerland and Italy, which came to last 15 months and can be identified as the
                    second decisive event is his education as critic. If Brandes’ intellectual
                    education had up to this point been shaped purely from the books he had read and
                    written about, then his education and the development of his ideas during the
                    journey were more spontaneous and desultory, based as they were on personal
                    encounters and conversations and on observations of art, people, places and
                    landscapes. As Henning Fenger has asserted, Brandes was “an ingenious traveler,”
                    who by virtue of his social skills and talent for conversation quickly
                    established personal contacts and networks in the places he visited (Fenger
                    1957:169). Through his expansive, almost daily correspondence with home, which
                    functioned as kind of combined intellectual diary and archive of impressions and
                    travel memories for later literary reworking, we can follow his doings and also
                    locate the first sketches of what after his return home would become
                        <em>Emigrant Literature</em>.</p>
                <p>The first destination was Paris, where the newly minted doctor of contemporary
                    French aesthetics was received like a son by the Taine family. Through Taine he
                    was able to make contact with Ernest Renan, author of the scandalous biography
                    of the historical Jesus, <em>La Vie de Jésus</em>, who however, and much to
                    Brandes’ surprise, revealed himself to be a man with strongly elitist and
                    anti-democratic views. Brandes was further introduced to the circle around
                    Philarète Chasles (1798-1873), a literary historian, librarian and professor of
                    English at the Collège de France who is less remembered today. By virtue of his
                    surveys of German and English literary history, Chasles is among the early
                    pioneers of comparative literature, but the 72-year-old man of letters was
                    additionally known as a walking encyclopedia of the private lives and scandals
                    of the great French authors of Romantism, whom he had known personally.</p>
                <p>Though Brandes would affectionately refer to Chasles as “the old fuddy duddy” in
                    his correspondence with his family, he did indeed learn a thing or two from him.
                    In a letter written the night of June 15th, 1870, Brandes enthusiastically
                    relates a visit to Chasles the evening before, in which the affable professor
                    had held court with his colorful anecdotes and gossip on 19th century literary
                    life in France. “I sit like a sponge and take it all in. I listen with 24 ears,”
                    Brandes notes: “at last I glimpse behind the scenes of the whole of literary
                    life here” (Brandes 1978, I:238-9).</p>
                <p>It is thus also after one of Chasles’ soirées that Brandes, in a June 20th letter
                    home, commits to paper the first sketch of a literary historical presentation of
                    “the great currents in new French literature” (Brandes 1978, I:249), which in
                    broad strokes contains the central idea and plan of the three “French” volumes
                    of <em>Main Currents</em> (the first, third and fifth volumes), as well as the
                    polemical attack on contemporary Danish literature featured in the introductory
                    lecture. The sketch portrays the evolution of 19th century French literary
                    history from Romantism toward Naturalism as a dialectical interplay between the
                    spirit of Voltaire and the spirit of Rousseau, e.g. between the regimes of
                    reason and nature and passion. Brandes identifies three phases or groups within
                    this process. First is Romantism – the French <em>Sturm-und-Drang</em> –
                    represented by figures such as Alexandre Dumas père, early Victor Hugo and
                    George Sand, who place nature and passion at the center of literary production,
                    thereby constituting a continuation of the spirit of Rousseau. Brandes places
                    the July Revolution of 1830 as the historical ground point of this period.
                    Thereafter follows the sudden shift toward the so-called “L’école de bon sens,”
                    the stolid and temperate school of French theater represented by Neoclassical
                    dramatists such as Eugène Scribe and Émile Augier, with moralism and idealism as
                    common traits. But around 1850 a new rupture opens up a third period, the
                    positivistic and naturalistic “<em>realism</em> with a <em>physiological
                        basis</em>,” represented by Taine, Renan, Dumas fils, the brothers Goncourt,
                    and Flaubert.</p>
                <p>After this literary historical survey of 19th century movements and groups in
                    French literature, Brandes provides a few comparative perspectives on
                    contemporary Danish literature. Oehlenschläger’s position in early Romanticism
                    is likened to that of early Victor Hugo in France, and a “moral” turn is dated
                    to Søren Kierkegaard’s <em>Either-Or</em> (1843). But the analogy can be stretched no
                    further, and thus Brandes reaches the conclusion that would come to function as
                    the polemical <em>fulcrum</em> in the introductory lecture of 1871: “You see
                    that we have still not reached the third period” (Brandes 1978, I:252). Danish
                    literature has thus stalled in moralistic reaction and is therefore outside the
                    main current of European literature.</p>
                <p>With respect to the later programmatic declaration in the introductory lecture,
                    it cannot but be observed that Brandes himself was at least a generation or two
                    behind in his literary points of orientation. His knowledge of modern French
                    Naturalism was at this point severely limited, and in looking forward to his
                    program for the literary debate of social problems and the struggle of the
                    individual against “society” that would function as the provocative component of
                    the introductory lecture of 1871, it is likewise clear that the matrix of this
                    program was not contemporary French Naturalism, but rather the French and
                    English Romanticism from the years around 1830, with the poet and freedom
                    fighter Lord Byron as its symbolic hero. In 1871 Brandes called for a literature
                    that submitted modern problems such as marriage, religion and private property
                    to debate. An early formulation of this call to arms is present in a note from
                    the letter of June 1870 – but here, noticeably, as part of a historical
                    characterization of French Romanticism:</p>
                <blockquote>Convergence in the Revolution of 1830 . . . attack on society, on
                    property (Proudhon), on marriage (A. Dumas’ Anthony, Forward to Victor Hugo’s
                    Angelo. Fourier, St. Simon. George Sand’s initial burst of creativity. The god
                    of Romantism is <em>passion</em>). </blockquote>
                <p>The inclusion of the socialist and anarchist Joseph-Pierre Proudhon (1809-65)
                    must be an error, since his critique of private property (presented in his
                        <em>Qu’est-ce que la propriéte?</em> [<em>What is Property?</em>, 1840]
                    rather belongs to the intellectual basis of the June Days uprising of 1848. But
                    regardless of this and other temporal disparities along the way, the note bears
                    witness to how Brandes attempted to link literary and political developments
                    together and how he saw Romantism not as a purely literary phenomenon, but as a
                    broader, intellectual historical and political current that also encompassed
                    revolutionary utopian and socialist social thinkers such as Henri de Saint-Simon
                    (1760-1825) and Charles Fourier (1772-1837). </p>

                <p>The encounter during the European journey that would undeniably prove to be the
                    most decisive for Brandes’ development was with the British philosopher,
                    economist and liberal politician John Stuart Mill (1806-73). The year before
                    Brandes had produced a Danish translation of Mill’s <em>The Subjection of
                        Women</em>, in which the British philosopher argued for the emancipation of
                    women and the equality of the sexes. In the beginning of July 1870, Mill passed
                    through Paris, taking the opportunity to seek out his Danish translator at his
                    quarters on the Rue Mazarine. This visit, which is lively related in his letters
                    home, marked the beginning of an intense philosophical exchange that clued
                    Brandes in to a new manner of conceiving literature and society. In a letter of
                    July 16th, Brandes proclaims that his conversations with Mill amounted to “a
                    kind of turning point in my inner intellectual history” (Brandes 1978,
                    I:275).</p>
                <p>As thinker Mill belonged to Empiricist tradition in English philosophy and social
                    science, which proceeded from the idea that all knowledge and perception must be
                    built on observation. On this foundation Mill developed a social and moral
                    philosophy, the so-called utilitarianism, which began with the proposition that
                    every human act must be evaluated according to its sum efficacy for society –
                    and not according to the degree to which it cohered with any predetermined
                    principles, whether they be determined by religion or a conception of natural
                    rights. Mill’s utilitarianism was critical to Brandes’ thinking in that it
                    provided a foundation for an ethics founded not in religious but in worldly
                    principles. Just as important for Brandes was the practical and pragmatic
                    dimension of Mill’s philosophy, which blended together conceptions of freedom
                    with the social and political reform movements and the technological and
                    economic developments of the age. “His ideas resemble railroads. Simple, without
                    ornament, useful, grand. He bothers not with roads, but with railroads,” notes
                    Brandes in a letter of July 10<sup>th</sup>, 1870 (Brandes 1978, I:269).</p>
                <p>Brandes’ enthusiasm for the philosophy of Mill was also motivated by a
                    fascination with modern English society as the most progressive in relation to
                    democratic reforms and the relations between the sexes. At the same his visit to
                    England also strengthened the comparative observation he had already made in
                    Paris, not just of the difference in manners and customs between the European
                    countries, but also of the immense ignorance of the European nations’ knowledge
                    of each other’s culture and intellectual life. Just as in Paris he had been
                    surprised by Taine’s ignorance of Germany, so he could in England discern Mill’s
                    equally striking lack of knowledge of Hegel’s philosophy. This experience made
                    it clear to Brandes that there was a need for a cosmopolitan mediator between
                    European literatures.</p>

                <h1 id="italy">8. Grand Tour of 1870-1: Italy.</h1>

                <p>When the Franco-Prussian War broke out in July 1870, Brandes left Paris,
                    travelling southward by train over the Alps to Geneva and then on through Italy,
                    including Turin, Milan, Florence, and Rome. This part of the journey resulted in
                    the nature descriptions of Rousseau’s land of birth around Lake Geneva and the
                    ecstatic depictions of Italian landscapes, art and architecture that constitute
                    some of the literary highpoints of <em>Emigrant Literature</em> (chaps. I and
                    XVI). Brandes’ enthusiasm for Italy was first and foremost awakened by his
                    encounter with the Renaissance and Antique architectural and artistic treasures
                    of Florence, Rome, Naples, and Pompeii. Yet his fascination was also possessed
                    of a more concrete and political dimension, tied to the modern Italian movement
                    for freedom, democracy and independence and to the recent annulment of the Papal
                    State in central Italy – an event that stirred up Brandes’ revolutionary
                    instincts. </p>
                <p>Brandes’ thoughts on these themes during his stay in Italy were stimulated by his
                    acquaintance with two quite distinctive intellects and personalities: the law
                    professor and later politician Giuseppe Saredo (1832-1902) of Rome, ten years
                    his senior, and the 24-year-old French art student Georges Noufflard (1846-97),
                    who like Brandes found himself in Italy as part of long lasting grand tour.</p>
                <p>Saredo was a fiery patriot, an advocate of young, independent Italy and thereby
                    an equally engaged liberal – a fighter for democracy, free trade and modern
                    industry as well as a follower of J.S. Mill’s philosophical and political
                    thought, which he saw as the very foundation of a modern liberal society. When
                    in November of 1870 Brandes was afflicted with typhus, which nearly took his
                    life and consequentially subjected him to four months of bedrest, it was Saredo
                    who for a time served as his daily conversation partner. Again, at this point
                    Brandes’ intellectual journey follows the path of a modern bildungsroman: Much
                    the same as the humanist Settembrini, in Thomas Mann’s <em>The Magic
                        Mountain</em> (1924), entertains the convalescent Hans Castorp with his
                    liberal ideas, it was Saredo who in the winter of 1870-1 held Brandes’ feet to
                    the fire with his hour-long discourses on the connection between humanism and
                    the technical and material progress of the modern world.</p>
                <p>Georges Noufflard was Saredo’s diametrical opposite: a refined and distinguished
                    aesthete, the son of wealthy clothing factory owner in Roubaix, who was in Rome
                    for research on a never realized book on the city’s monuments and artworks.
                    Brandes and Noufflard met in the Scandinavian Club in Rome at the beginning of
                    April 1871, just as Brandes had arisen from his convalescence. The two spent an
                    intense few months as companions, visiting the art museums and churches in Rome,
                    Sorrento and Naples, which exerted a decisive influence on Brandes’ conception
                    of art. More specifically, it was with Noufflard as his guide that Brandes
                    became attuned to the sensual and impassioned depiction of the human body in
                    Italian Renaissance and Baroque art – an experience that led him to look with
                    new and critical eyes on the Danish national icon Thorvaldsen and his more
                    subdued Neoclassicism, which he now declared to be unmodern and passé in a
                    letter home. And it was likewise the bel-esprit Noufflard who inspired Brandes
                    to develop the most provocative assumption in Emigrant Literature, the
                    irreverent takedown of the Danish and Northern European concept of “the home”
                    and its implied ideal of woman as a creature of it. This moralistic doctrine,
                    Brandes argued, could be traced back to “one singular, cruelly simple, cruelly
                    base climactic necessity,” namely the frigid Nordic climate and</p>
                <blockquote>the necessity of artificial heating . . . without artificial heating, in
                    the full magnificence of sunlight, all the beautiful ideals, duties and virtues
                    reveal themselves to be – not untrue but relative (Brandes
                    1872a:151).</blockquote>
                <p>This formulation is emblematic of the radicalization of Brandes’ thinking that
                    took place during his Italian journey. It is evidenced in that it added to the
                    positivist Tainean aesthetics and cultural analysis present in his dissertation
                    a more polemical and cultural critical dimension. It can also be said, in other
                    words, that the Italian journey resulted in the rebirth of Brandes as the
                    “Activist Critic” (Hertel and Kristensen 1980). It would no longer do for
                    Brandes merely to describe and to analyze how literary works and human moral
                    doctrines came into being as results of cultural, climactic and historical
                    conditions. It was now also necessary to reveal the reformative and
                    revolutionary potential of literature, which could be used to criticize and to
                    change the moral doctrines and rules of conduct viewed by a particular culture
                    as given and unchanging.</p>

                <h1 id="home">9. At Home Again, 1871. Confrontation</h1>

                <p>The grand tour was brought to an end in July 1871, as Brandes was to return home
                    to find a place in a society that, through his impressions of Italy, seemed all
                    the more barren and hostile to art and to humanity. His encounters with
                    philosophy of J.S. Mill, Saredo and youthful Italy had made Brandes a political
                    radical, while his friendship with Noufflard had stimulated a more existentially
                    and aesthetically motivated opposition to the Protestant art and culture of his
                    fatherland.</p>
                <p>These insights together explain why the grand tour in the case of Brandes did not
                    lead “homeward” toward a reconciliation, but instead manifested itself in a
                    fateful confrontation with his native national liberal culture, which would have
                    far reaching consequences for the future course of his life. Emigrant Literature
                    destroyed the possibility of an academic career for him in Denmark, but at the
                    same time opened up new pathways, in that it forced him instead to seek a living
                    as an independent writer in the growing German language literary market of
                    Europe, in which in the following years he would make a name for himself as tone
                    setting European literary critic.</p>

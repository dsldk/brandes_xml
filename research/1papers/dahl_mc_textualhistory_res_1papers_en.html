                <h1 id="design">1. Design</h1>
                <p>Georg Brandes’ <em>Main Currents in 19<sup>th</sup> Century Literature</em> was
                    published in six volumes between 1872 and 1890, and later in revised and
                    translated editions. </p>
                <p> His aim with the six volumes was to look at European literature as a unity and
                    to elucidate a series of common traits in German, French and English literature
                    in the period between 1789 and 1848. In so doing he was one of the first
                    European literary historians to establish a <em>comparative</em> point of view,
                    with among other motives the intention to cast light on Danish literature, which
                    according to Brandes was forty years behind Europe in its development. “The
                    comparative study of literature has the double advantage of bringing the foreign
                    closer to us, so that we can understand it, and of distancing us from our own,
                    so that we can see it in context,” Brandes announces in the introductory lecture
                    of November 1871, which also establishes Brandes’ preeminent principles: “the
                    belief in the right to free inquiry and in the eventual victory of free thought”
                    (Brandes 1872a:8, 7).</p>
                <p> Over the years Brandes delivered most of the lectures that form the basis of the
                    six published volumes in his capacity as lecturer at Copenhagen University.
                    Prominent civil servants and politicians denied him the professorship in
                    aesthetics that had been vacated in 1872, so that for the rest of his life he
                    earned his living as an independent writer. Through political maneuvering, he
                    did in 1902 receive the title of professor with a corresponding salary “to
                    support free scientific research,” which although funded by the university
                    budget did not involve a formal post at Copenhagen University (see Pelle Oliver
                    Larsen 2016:141, 386-91). </p>
                <p>Brandes presented his narrative in the form of a drama in six acts, with
                    liberalism as its structuring characteristic. In the foreword to the sixth
                    edition of 1923, Brandes introduces the work by noting that:</p>
                <blockquote><em>Main Currents</em> relates an episode of the history of the European
                    soul, in that the work presents the course of development in the literatures of
                    the major countries throughout the first half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century.
                    The design of the work is political, not literary. (Brandes 1923:3) </blockquote>
                <p> To begin with, he portrays the revolutionary movements of the 18<sup>th</sup>
                    century, culminating in the French Revolution of 1789. After the Revolution,
                    which constitutes the first action, follows the reaction, just as a thesis is
                    followed by an antithesis. With the defeat of Napoleon and the Congress of
                    Vienna of 1814-15, the Church and the state in Catholic Europe came together;
                    orthodoxy and authority became the new pillars of society. Ultimately there
                    followed the overcoming of the reaction, e.g. a renewal of action. This was
                    heralded by the Greek War of Liberation against Ottoman rule (1821-9),
                    specifically the heroic death of Byron in 1824, which in Brandes’ account
                    constitutes the decisive turnabout. After this the liberal movement picks up in
                    the French July Revolution of 1830 on toward its breakthrough in France and
                    Germany in 1848.</p>
                <p> This simple and clear construction is illustrated by the following model, which
                    at the same time demonstrates how culture and politics in Denmark were mired in
                    the traces of the reaction all the way forward to 1870. Brandes saw it as his
                    task to bring this reaction to a close and to bring Danish intellectual life
                    into alignment with the liberal European main current. </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Fig. Brandes' hegelian plot</em>
                    <img src="dahl_en2.png" title="Main Currents and Hegel"/>
                </p>
                <p>The model was inspired by the dialectical philosophy developed by F.W.J.
                    Schelling (1775-1854) and G.W.F. Hegel (1770-1831) at the beginning of the
                        19<sup>th</sup> century, which came to play a powerful role in the
                    Post-Hegelian tradition in which Brandes was schooled at the university. Each
                    concept leads to its own opposite, its negation, but in such a way that the
                    negated concept is sublimated, entering into a greater relation, a synthesis,
                    which forms a new unity of opposites. Brandes explains this in the introductory
                    lecture as such: </p>
                <blockquote>Reaction as such is far from the same thing as regression. Far from it!
                    A true, appropriate, correcting reaction is progress. But such a reaction is
                    powerful and short- lived and does not stagnate. After a time combatting the
                    excesses of a previous period, after bringing to light what it suppressed, the
                    new period takes up the content of the previous one, reconciles itself with it,
                    and continues its movement. </blockquote>

                <p>Hereafter Brandes clarifies the challenge he is issuing, summarizing the
                    reasoning in an image: </p>
                <blockquote> This is not what has happened here. When a stick has been bent in one
                    direction, one straightens it out by bending it in the other direction—but one
                    does not keep doing this. (Brandes 1872a:12). </blockquote>
                <p>The rhetorical presentation of the lectures was brilliant and impactful. Brandes
                    was a splendid, rhetorically conscious lecturer. The very form of his
                    presentation appealed to the passion its content would encourage. The style
                    culminated in images that encapsulated and completed the manner of thinking,
                    supplied the feelings with associations and provided his powers of
                    representation or his imagination with perspective. When the argumentation was
                    forgotten, its central points remained present in the consciousness of the
                    spectators as an image. In the introductory lecture Brandes refers to Aesop’s
                    fable of “The Fox and the Stork,” which illustrates his point about the
                    comparative perspective, and concludes by invoking the motif of the current:</p>
                <blockquote> The major part of the work will entail opening up a multiplicity of
                    channels through which can flow the streams and currents that have their origin
                    in the revolution and the age of progress, thereby putting a stop to reaction in
                    all those areas in which its task has historically come to an end. (Brandes
                    1872a:28). </blockquote>
                <p> The goal of the lectures was to bring Danish intellectual life and politics into
                    agreement with development in Europe. Brandes adopted the contention of the
                    French philosopher and literary historian Hippolyte Taine (1828-93) that a
                    country’s literature reflects “the entire history of its views and feelings”
                    (Brandes 1872a:9); as far as Denmark was concerned, this was a history in bits
                    and pieces, with sizable lacunae and without a great deal of independence, and
                    therefore in a broad sense a history subordinated to influences and impacts from
                    abroad. This takes into account the fact that not all European currents reached
                    Denmark, indeed sometimes only those of the reaction, as was the case, according
                    to Brandes with the restorationist containment of Enlightenment ideals and
                    revolutionary ideas. Now this backlog should be overcome, and literature should
                    express existing life and relate itself to the conditions of the present instead
                    of viewing life through the lens of or relating to the past. To be oneself is to
                    be modern, and that a literature is alive is demonstrated when it “provokes
                    debate” (Brandes 1872a:15). </p>
                <p> This polemical sting in the form of the juxtaposition of the literatures of
                    Europe’s major countries and a stagnate Danish culture was the launching point
                    of <em>Main Currents</em>, particularly in its first two volumes. In the revised
                    editions of all six volumes, which came out between 1891 and 1898, a measure of
                    the polemical remarks and comparisons were removed, such that the work came
                    across more as a European literary history written for European readers. In the
                    English translation, for example, the introductory lecture is nearly entirely
                    edited out. On the one hand this meant that the work lost a measure of the
                    polemical bite that had resulted in such intense attention in Denmark and
                    Scandinavia, while on the other, in the European context, it was evaluated
                    according to a more general, literary historical approach. </p>
                <p> In the meantime, as the two final volumes were completed in 1882 and 1890, the
                    movement that Brandes (first with his 1883 book <em>The Men of the Modern
                        Breakthrough</em>) would come to call the “Modern Breakthrough” became a
                    living reality, even if he himself sought to revise his views.</p>
                <p> The following describes in part the fundamental characteristics of the
                    development (or rather perhaps change) that takes place between the first volume
                    and the last, and in part how precisely these fundamental characteristics were
                    at the center of the textual revisions to which Brandes over the course of time
                    subjected his narrative, not the least with respect to the first two volumes. </p>
                <p> Emphasis is here placed on citing from Brandes’ texts in full, because less well
                    known and less accessible texts are often discussed, and because it is important
                    to view the critical individual citations in their initial form and context. </p>

                <p> A functional relationship between the great and the small runs throughout the
                    work of Georg Brandes, in both his earlier and later aesthetics. The great is
                    that which delivers the abundance of details and places them in perspective. The
                    small or the singular, if it cannot be explained, appears as <em>chance</em>,
                    and it is chance that becomes the immense challenge of post-Hegelian aesthetics. </p>
                <p> In his literary criticism at the end of the 1860s, in order to break with the
                    harmonizing idealism of Biedermeier culture, Brandes had, inspired by Taine,
                    pushed his frame of explanation and his perspective – “the great” – as far
                    outward as was possible, while at the same time seeking out “the small,” the
                    actual, the earthy details. As suggested in the 1869 essay on <em>Henry IV, Part
                        One</em>, “’The Infinitely Small’” and the ‘Infinitely Great’ in Poetry”
                    (published in the journal <em>Illustreret Tidende</em> and included a year later
                    in the book <em>Criticism and Portraits</em>), the scope of characterization of
                    a literary figure should be as wide as possible.</p>
                <p>In reality this involved a difficult process of balancing, which can be
                    illustrated with a longer citation from Brandes’ dissertation on Taine that
                    concerns whether an individual should be viewed as a whole or should be divided
                    up into analyzable parts:</p>
                <blockquote> As far as the individual is concerned, it is often doubtful whether the
                    natural groups of his intellectual production would lead us to group them with
                    the individual himself as the center. Because of the imperfections of the
                    individual, he only strives to be an intellectual organism, but in reality and
                    at many points, intellectually as well as bodily, he is no more than an
                    aggregate. Even the unity of consciousness is more or less like the freedom of
                    the will only an ideal, not a reality. If <em>as I believe it to be correct</em>
                    the task of scientific analysis is to dissolve artificial groups and form
                    natural ones, then sometimes the correct scientific approach will be to treat a
                    part of the work of the individual as literary history, another as military
                    history, and a third as criminal history or the history of customs. Just as the
                    gradient of a falling stone and the law of gravity belong more closely together
                    than the gradient, color, and sound we unite in our minds when we think of the
                    stone, so it will be also most effective to understand the different aspects of
                    the diffused personality on the basis of the different intellectual currents of
                    the age, rather than as emanating from the midpoint of the personality. (Brandes
                    1870b:33-4, italics author’s)</blockquote>
                <p> The individual can therefore be understood as either an aggregate or an
                    organism. His productivity or his works can (as for example in <em>Emigrant
                        Literature</em>) be understood as a manifestation or a product of
                    intellectual currents which lend themselves to analysis, or with the midpoint of
                    the personality as the source. In his dissertation Brandes asserts (as in the
                    italicized text above) that although the goal has yet to be reached, the
                    scientific method of analysis and the aggregate perspective constitute the
                    proper path forward.</p>
                <p>In <em>Explanation and Defense</em>, published just a few months after
                        <em>Emigrant Literature</em>, Brandes wrote that he:</p>
                <blockquote> only portrays works in so far as that they express the feelings and
                    thoughts of the age in a lively manner, that is to say with constant reference
                    to their cultural historical worth. My approach is thus not to provide
                    summaries; I have continuously emphasized the critical points of view, I have
                    comparatively drawn new parallels, and I have demonstrated the linkage between
                    no small number of literary phenomena that previously were viewed as unrelated
                    (...) I have long followed this method that I have developed and explained in my
                    dissertation, I have employed it in a host of shorter critical pieces (...) I
                    read the history of an age in its types (...) According to the method I follow,
                    a work has value to the same degree that it is typical . . . (Brandes
                    1872b:7-9).</blockquote>
                <p> After his dissertation and a European grand tour between April 1870 and the
                    summer of 1871, Brandes in fact attempted to go further on the question of the
                    formation of consciousness. <em>Main Currents</em> was initially envisioned
                    according to this scientific orientation. Immediately after the appearance of
                    the first volume and his defense of it in the fall of 1872 and a series of
                    lectures on recent French drama, Brandes attempted to return to this question.
                    During the entire summer of 1872 he was occupied with a work on the association
                    of ideas. Associationist psychology was an effort to break with the doctrine of
                    innate ideas and the unity of the I or of the personality. Inspiration was
                    provided from Stuart Mill and Taine, but perhaps also from his slightly older
                    studies of J.F. Herbart.</p>
                <p> In a letter to his friend Julius Salomonsen (1847-1924), dated “Sunrise, July
                    20th 1872,” the project (or vision) is presented in this manner: “And this idea
                    is so lovely, so lovely! </p>

                        hundred pages and many shall read it with admiration (...) Dear friend, if I
                        should kick the bucket before I finish this, you must tell everyone that I
                        wanted to carry out a depiction of the above in Danish and thereby ground
                        our philosophy here in Norden on a new basis, a true basis, which permits
                        the demonstration of <em>altogether determinative, incontrovertible
                            laws</em>, quite like in mechanics and chemistry. You can also let it be
                        known that all the other philosophy here in Denmark amounts to figments of
                        the imagination and so much chatter, idealistic dreams, and thus allow me to
                        acquire the reputation of one who defined philosophy as <em>science of the
                            laws of the intellect</em>, and who ventured to assert that as such it
                        is of the same rank as the natural sciences, which are sciences of the laws
                        of nature. All philosophy is psychology. All psychology is based on
                        observation. All psychology is the doctrine of associations, associations
                        and sense impressions, of images, of ideas and of names. The associations
                        are the mortar that holds together the bricks in the grand edifice of the
                        intellect. (Georg and Edv. Brandes 1939:279-80)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Yet that very same summer Brandes had to abandon the project. In his memoirs he
                    laconically noted that “my abilities were not up to the task of elaborating the
                    fundamental thoughts occurring to me, and after a months I let the work go”
                    (Brandes 1939:279-80). </p>
                <p>Traces of the problematic and its concepts, however, are found in the chapter on
                    “Romantic Reflection and Psychology” in <em>The Romantic School in Germany</em>
                    (Brandes 1873:207-), in which the following passage at long last establishes
                    distance from the self-dissolving determinants of the aggregate point of
                    view:</p>
                <blockquote>But if the human being is now by the necessity of nature multifaceted
                    and split and divided up by nature, then it is one through freedom. Freedom,
                    will and resolve make a human whole. If the human being as a product of nature
                    is only a multiplicity held together more or less securely by associations, then
                    the human being as intellect is an individuality, and in the will collects all
                    the elements of the intellect and thus functions like the edge of a sword.
                    (Brandes 1873:213).</blockquote>

                <p>As so often in Brandes, the reasoning is summarized as an image. And the sword
                    elegantly cuts open the Gordian knots that had troubled his dissertation. In
                    comparing this citation with the context and the resonance in the second edition
                    of the book (Brandes 1891:257-69), it is evident that “idea-associations” as a
                    concept has been supplanted by “idea–connections” and “thought-chains,” such
                    that the concealed reference to the contradiction ridden dilemma raised by the
                    dissertation fades away. At the same time the “freedom” that rendered the human
                    being as one (note the inserted “however” below) is supported by a doctrine of
                    the <em>personality</em>: </p>
                <blockquote>[the human being is] however as the healthy, vigorous personality, one.
                    Purpose, will, resolve make the human being whole. If the human being as product
                    of nature is only a multiplicity held together more or less securely by chains
                    of thoughts, then the human being as intellect is a unity (Brandes
                    1891:268).</blockquote>
                <p>A vitalistic and Nietzschean solution is thereby provided for the psychology of
                    the self. This change in argumentation and conceptual formation, which has roots
                    in his work on the dissertation, can be seen as a recurring feature in the
                    revision of especially the first volume, but the accentuated conception of the
                    personality can be detected in all six volumes</p>

                <h1 id="composition">3. Composition</h1>
                <p> When Brandes returned from his travels in Europe in the summer of 1871 he had
                    first thought of delivering a series of public lectures on “Recent French
                    Drama,” a theme with which he was familiar from his role as theater critic at
                        <em>Illustreret Tidende</em> since 1867. (The lectures were published in
                    1978 by Henning Fenger as <em>Georg Brandes and Recent French Drama. Theater
                        Reviews and Dramaturgical Lectures, 1865-1872</em>). The lectures on drama
                    were however put off until the spring of 1872, because his mentor of many years,
                    the philosopher Hans Brøchner (1820-75), found them to be too narrow and
                    unimpressive. Instead, as noted in his memoirs, at the beginning of October,
                    Brøchner proposed a broader theme for lectures that could have greater impact.
                    Brandes also mentions in the memoirs that his chief concern at the time was a
                    (polemical) diagnosis of “the cultural standpoint of Denmark at present and a
                    critique of the literature of its past, which would function as my starting
                    point” (Brandes 1907:62-3).</p>
                <p> Shortly thereafter, Brandes came back to Brøchner with a proposal for six long
                    series of lectures, collectively titled “Fundamental Currents”
                    [Grundstrømninger]. After consultation with Brøchner, this was changed to “Main
                    Currents” [Hovedstrømninger], which is the designation Brandes employs in a
                    letter to Emil Petersen, dated October 20th, 1871 (Georg Brandes and Emil
                    Petersen 1980:142). </p>
                <p> The first of the lectures was delivered at 6:00 PM, November 3rd, 1871, while
                    the last was given on December 16th. Shortly after, on the 27th, Brandes
                    summarized his central disposition for all six volumes in a letter to Taine,
                    adding “mais je n’ose pas encore le faire imprimer; les orthodoxies sont trop en
                    rage contre moi” [but I dare not allow this to be published, for the orthodox
                    types are too angry with me] (Brandes 1952:7). </p>
                <p> The final explanation of the relationship between Brøchner and Brandes is
                    provided by the philosopher Carl Henrik Koch. His (prudent) conclusion is that
                    the program of ideas – freethinking, freedom of intellect, free humanity – does
                    indeed refer back to the conclusion of the 18th century, but that it is first
                    and foremost the voice of Brøchner (rather than Hegel) that stands behinds these
                    words. It was Brandes himself, however, who <em>radicalized</em> Brøchner’s
                    conception of freedom (Carl Henrik Koch 2000:128-50).</p>
                <p> As noted, the six volumes of <em>Main Currents</em> were intended as a drama in
                    six acts, determined by the literary groups characterized in each. First the
                    emigrants exiled by the revolution, next the German Romantics and their reaction
                    against the revolution, and in the third volume the corresponding course of
                    reaction in France. The reversal in the drama arrives with English Naturalism in
                    the fourth volume, whereas here “Naturalism” signifies the love of nature rather
                    than Émile Zola’s later iteration of the impartial depiction of reality. Byron’s
                    death in 1824 during the Greek War of Liberation against the Ottoman Empire
                    (1821-9) marks for Brandes the decisive positive turnabout in European
                    liberalism. The fifth volume concerns the liberal movement as manifested among
                    other places in the July Revolution of 1830, with Balzac as its leading author,
                    while the sixth and concluding volume treats the corresponding movement in
                    Germany forward to 1848, with Ludvig Börne and Heinrich Heine as the main
                    figures. </p>
                <p> The composition was first and foremost inspired by the liberal German historian
                    and politician G.G. Gervinus (1805-71) and his work <em>Geschichte des. 19.
                        Jahrhunderts seit den Wiener Verträgen</em> (8 vols., 1855-66), which
                    Brandes had borrowed from the Royal Library in August 1871, and Hermann
                    Hettners’ <em>Literaturgeschichte des achtzehnten Jahrhunderts in drei
                        Theilen</em> (8 vols., 1856-72), also borrowed at the same time (see
                    bibliography in Henning Fenger 1955:445, 447). These were especially significant
                    for the critical concept of the composition as drama (the term “emigrant
                    literature” and the prominent placement of Madame de Staël are owed to Gervinus)
                    and for the description of the genre bending currents, born by ideas and fixed
                    into types that are representative of an epoch. The relatively plentiful and
                    independent portraits of woman that Brandes inserts in especially the first two
                    volumes are also primarily due to Gervinus: beyond Madame de Staël, these
                    include George Sand, Dorothea Veit, Caroline Schlegel, Madame de Krüdener, Rahel
                    von Varnhagen, Bettina von Arnim, and Charlotte Stieglitz (see Gunnar Ahlström
                    1937).</p>
                <p> Brandes’ portrayal of political liberalism contains an inner tension between two
                    main currents that he had lucidly described in the opening pages of <em>The
                        Reaction in France</em> (1874). One emanated from Rousseau. It is the
                        <m>unifying</m> principle, enthusiasm, by which the social <em>feeling of
                        solidarity</em> counteracts the authority principle; socialism begins here,
                    through Robespierre and the Jacobins. The other originates in Voltaire. It is a
                    subversive principle, by which <em>indignation</em> and freethinking crush the
                    authority principle; liberalism emerges here as <em>individualism</em>, through
                    Condorcet and the Girondins. On the one side <em>brotherhood</em>, on the other
                        <em>freedom</em>. Yet both traditions demand <em>equality</em>. In this
                    context it is worth recalling that the designation “liberal” first gained a
                    foothold after 1800, just as “individualism” only acquired a positive valence
                    after around 1860. </p>
                <p> In order to put the main lines clearly into perspective, the Rousseauian thread
                    can be traced forward to the image of the centralized state with subordinate
                    civil servants, which Brandes himself imagined during his stay in Berlin between
                    1877 and 1883, albeit also – in an early foreboding image of socialism –
                    tempered by fear of the tyranny of the majority. In a more positive variant
                    Brandes also considers a solidaristic social utopia, the idea of a
                        <em>better</em> society with happiness for the many.</p>
                <p> The Voltairean thread concerns the human being as an autonomous individual,
                    described among other places in European Romantism, with which the young Brandes
                    was familiar. Here the individual begins where the state ends, and here an
                    elitist cultivation of intelligence and sophistication can thrive. The
                    implications for society can be vague, but it generally involves a
                        <em>truer</em> and <em>more just</em> society, in which the autonomy and
                    value of the individual is respected.</p>
                <p> In his <em>Den ensamme. En motivstudie i det moderna genombrottets
                        litteratur</em> (1961), the Swedish literary scholar Thure Stenström has
                    described the two traditions in the literature of the Modern Breakthrough as
                    respectively “naturalistic feeling of community” and “Romantic individualism.”
                    The two traditions can be traced as clear threads all the way through <em>Main
                        Currents</em>. </p>
                <p>In the first years of the 1870s, Brandes read up on socialist theory, especially
                    the Saint-Simonians and Ferdinand Lassalle, about whom he wrote a book, first
                    published in German in 1877 and then in Danish in 1881. In the introductory
                    lecture he had emphasized how Danish society had developed such that “it bears
                    the features of tyranny under the mask of freedom” (Brandes 1872a:15). Brandes
                    had experienced and described the reaction as an amoral duality. A few years
                    later, through Lassalle (as well as an image borrowed from Sainte-Beuve),
                    Brandes came to understand the bourgeois reaction as an element of class
                    struggle:</p>
                <blockquote> it can be seen that the bourgeoisie tried to pull the ladder up with it
                    as soon as it had reached the top. Its first action after having itself secured
                    its status through the pen was to take the pen out of the hand of the
                    proletariat. (compare Lassalle: <em>Arbeiterprogramm</em>). (Brandes 1874:46 –
                    in the second edition the parenthesis around the Lassalle citation are
                    eliminated: Brandes 1892:41). </blockquote>

                <p>Yet later in the book Brandes declares his preference regarding the Rousseauian
                    and Voltairean traditions: </p>
                <blockquote> The central idea is that it is not the family, as is usually asserted,
                    but the individual that constitutes the fundamental pillar of society, and that
                    the individual is sovereign. The sovereignty of the individual, e.g. the freedom
                    of the press, speech, travel, exchange, inquiry and freedom of feeling. From
                    this point of view the only possible defense of a law that constrains freedom is
                    that such a law, through the provisional impingement upon freedom, is the only
                    means of acquiring a more perfect arrangement with complete freedom, for freedom
                    is the ideal of individualism (Brandes 1874:151-72). </blockquote>

                    <h2>a. Types</h2>
                    <p> In each of the six volumes, Brandes devotes the introductory chapters to
                        describing the historical and political background of the works he will
                        analyze, which is generally followed up by a corresponding summary at the
                        conclusion. His assertion that “first and foremost and everywhere I trace
                        the literature back to life” (Brandes 1873:4) functions as a recurring
                        declaration of fighting words. Yet rather than a relationship of dependency,
                        it is more accurate to say that Brandes – as well oriented and well informed
                        as he was – outlines the background and the context only for those works of
                        literature that concern him. The connection between background and
                        foreground is established with the help of <em>types</em>, in which the
                        societal tensions of an epoch come to expression symptomatically. In
                            <em>Emigrant Literature</em> it is especially Goethe’s Werther and
                        Chateaubriand’s René that function as clear examples of a passionate
                        individual who in the effort to emancipate himself collides with societal
                        limitations: “the principal source of Werther’s sorrows is the discordance
                        between the infinity of the heart and the strictures of society” (Brandes
                        1872a:55). In the rhetoric of his presentation, these examples were
                        accompanied by reassurances that the author “portrays for the reader, purely
                        historically and scientifically, a state of the soul that historically has
                        revealed and documented itself in the literature (Brandes 1872a:89-90). “The
                        literary historian who moves from one variation of a type of the age to
                        another proceeds as does the natural scientist, who pursues the same
                        transformation of fundamental forms” (Brandes 1872a:91).</p>
                    <p>In the course of the six volume Brandes found it increasingly difficult to
                        maintain the typological matrix, and in looking at the formulations in the
                        revised editions it is often apparent that the abstract ideas and movements
                        that originally functioned as the frame were rewritten as concrete
                        influences and thoughts. This is why many of the thematic chapter headings
                        of the first editions were replaced with author names in the second
                        editions. This coheres with a positivistic biographical trait that is more
                        closely explained below. </p>
                    <p> At the same time it also became clearer to him that while the typological
                        concept ensured a strong conception of the presentation and invited
                        comparative characterization of the variants of types, this occurred at the
                        expense of a coherent reading of the individual literary works. This
                        contributed to the weakening of <em>Main Currents</em> as a literary
                        historical handbook in comparison to the more recent national literary
                        histories that came on the market (Danish literary history writing is
                        described in Flemming Conrad 2006). </p>

                    <h2>b. Comparatism and Positivism</h2>
                    <p> Brandes was a <em>forerunner</em> to the kind of comparative literary
                        studies that only began to develop in earnest in the years following. The
                        concern of <em>Main Currents</em> was not so much comparative literary study
                        in the modern sense of the word, that is the study of impacts and influences
                        between literatures, but a general or universal description of the major
                        European literatures in (polemical) comparison with that of Denmark.</p>
                    <p> Methodologically speaking, the immediate inspiration for the six volumes
                        were the theoretical books of Hippolyte Taine and his English literary
                        history <em>Histoire de la littérature anglaise</em> (4 vols., 1864, DA
                        1874-7). Brandes specifically employed Taine’s analogies between aesthetics
                        and classifying natural science in <em>Emigrant Literature</em>. The
                        overarching and determinant factors that Brandes sought to identify were
                        “race,” “milieu” and “moment,” while the material and the authors were
                        arranged in “schools” around “the dominate character” of a single
                        figure.</p>
                    <p> In order to honor the triumphant practice of the natural sciences,
                        scientific literary study began with a narrowing of perspective and interest
                        to controllable and manageable individual processes, in which the principle
                        of causality could be employed – and employed with success. </p>
                    <p> In Germany during the period in which Brandes worked, a positivistic
                        literary studies and a praxis of literary history in a narrower sense
                        developed, associated with figures such as Wilhelm Scherer (1841-86) and his
                        successor in Berlin, Erich Schmidt (1853-1913). At the same time it was
                        marked as a distinctly national practice of literary history, appropriate to
                        the German Reich that was established in 1871 under Bismarck’s reliable
                        leadership. Here the critical, source-based study of impacts and influences
                        was developed and refined. In place of the open expanses of “race,” “milieu”
                        and “moment,” the influential Wilhelm Scherer, whom Brandes got to know
                        during his years in Berlin, inserted the “closed” categories of “das
                        Ererbte,” “das Erlernte” and “das Erlebte.” In France, Taine’s pupil
                        Ferdinand Brunetière (1849-1906) isolated the cultural historical “moment,”
                        and within that the more narrowly literary, more specifically determined
                        genre. </p>
                    <p> Now literary studies began to seek the impacts and influences of individual
                        concrete events, of personal incidents or of reading. In polemic against
                        idealism, scholars sought out the laws of imagination in order to uncover
                        empirically how the poetic imagination functions; these conditions lent
                        themselves to isolation and description, while the more comprehensive – and
                        decisive – societal logic, which is found between the individual events and
                        tensions and renders them as manifest forms or as symptoms, were much more
                        difficult to handle. Here the category of “experience” served a key function
                        as the smallest possible unity whose impact could be definitively traced.
                        Literary observation was interested in experience not for what it
                            <em>resulted from</em>, but for what it <em>resulted in</em>. Biography
                        or the biographical frame now became the manner of integrating the details
                        investigated. At the same time it is an approach that at many points appeals
                        to empathy, understanding and identification. </p>
                    <p> This development in the direction of positivism was strongly enhanced by the
                        emergence of national philologies and the establishment of corresponding
                        university curricula (see Klaus Weimar 1989 and König and Lämmert 1993. For
                        Anglo-American development see Gerald Graff 1987. The French development is
                        covered in Carl Fehrman 1999). </p>
                    <p> Yet Main Currents landed in Germany <em>before</em> all of this happened.
                        The work fulfilled a characterizing and perspectivizing function in a period
                        in which the establishment of national literary studies had yet to acquire a
                        solid foundation as an independent discipline. As the new discipline was
                        relatively rapidly developed at the university lectern, Brandes’ work was on
                        the other hand progressively dismissed and marginalized, since it did not
                        fulfill the ever-growing demands of the national philological school.</p>
                    <p> Max Koch established <em>Zeitschrift für vergleichende
                            Literaturgeschichte</em> in 1887, but around 1890 the center for wider
                        comparative literary studies shifted from Germany to France. In 1896 Joseph
                        Texte (1865-1900) took up the first chair in “littérature comparé at the
                        University of Lyon; later figures in the French comparative tradition
                        include Fernand Baldensperger and Paul van Tieghem. In Denmark Valdemar
                        Vedel (1865-1942) became first lecturer and later in 1911 temporary
                        professor in general and comparative literature; in 1918 the professorship
                        was made permanent.</p>
                    <p> Over the course of time Brandes produced a number of lesser studies within
                        the more narrowly defined comparative tradition, for example “Goethe and
                        Denmark” of 1880 (republished in Brandes 1883b) and “Henrik Ibsen and his
                        School in Germany” of 1890 (republished in Brandes 1906), but overall the
                        rapid development of the discipline and the transfer of its scholarly center
                        from Germany to France served to diminish the literary historical
                        significance of Brandes’ opus magnum. </p>
                    <p>Instead he used his status as critic and artist as a bulwark against the
                        intrusive demands of the professionalized discipline. In the foreword to
                            <em>People and Works</em> (1883) he suggests that literary criticism
                        could be viewed as an applied science: “it is this to a certain point; but
                        it is no less an art; for no methodical investigation can provide us with
                        the key to a coherent human intellect” (Brandes 1883b:V). At the conclusion
                        of the sixth volume of <em>Main Currents</em> Brandes defends himself
                        against the condemnations of his Danish critics:</p>
                    <blockquote> Here is the answer, that viewed impersonally the literature of a
                        half century is only a chaos of hundreds of thousands of works in a great
                        number of languages, and that the genuine Procrustes who has grouped,
                        contrasted, stylized, emphasized and de- emphasized, expanded and
                        contracted, placed in full light, half light or in shadows, is none other
                        than the power normally referred to as art. (Brandes 1890:573).

                    <h2>c. A conflict over publication rights</h2>
                </div>
                <p>
                    <em>Main Currents</em>, from volume to volume as well as from the first editions
                    to the later revised versions, is characterized by a clear and continual
                    movement away from the broad, Taine-inspired foundation toward a narrower focus
                    on the biographical. This was the result of the more or less conscious
                    disciplinary and methodological development Brandes underwent during the more
                    than fifteen years the six volumes were under construction. But when because of
                    his own lack of forethought he found himself in a conflict over the publication
                    rights to the German editions, he wrote an account, blessed by the wisdom of
                    hindsight, of the changes to the foundation of the work he had undertaken prior
                    to the new German editions. This was thus a partisan brief in a court case, yet
                    at the same time noteworthy as testament of his methodological
                    self-understanding. It was formatted as a letter to his (new) publisher, Hermann
                    Credner (1842-1924) of the house Veit &amp; Co., but a Danish version was
                    published in <em>Politiken</em> on July 4th, 1887.</p>
                <p> The first four volumes of<em> Main Currents</em> were quickly translated into
                    German by Adolf Strodtmann (1829-79), issued through Duncker of Berlin between
                    1872 and 1876. After bankruptcy in 1886 the firm was acquired by the book
                    publisher Hermann Barsdorf. Brandes was not content with the arrangement and in
                    1880 had entered into an agreement with Veit &amp; Co. for a new edition, now
                    titled <em>Die Literatur des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts in ihren Hauptströmungen
                        dargestellt</em>. Although the remainders were transferred to Veit &amp;
                    Co., the house did not, because of carelessness on its part as well as on
                    Brandes, secure the rights to Strodtmann’s translations. The Danish government
                    did not sign the 1886 Bern Convention, which concerned publication rights in
                    countries outside the native lands of authors, until 1903, so Barsdorf issued a
                    whole series of new printings without the agreement of Brandes or the payment of
                    royalties to him. To avoid additional legal troubles Brandes was compelled to
                    revise the collected volumes of <em>Main Currents</em>; Veit &amp; Co.’s edition
                    was thus only completed in 1901 (the complex legal issues are explained in the
                    chapter on “The Barsdorf Nightmare” in Jørgen Knudsen 1994:414-421; see also
                    Jens Bjerring-Hansen 2008:150-67).</p>
                <p> According to the agreement with Veit &amp; Co., the new and revised editions of
                    the first four volumes were to be made available in 1882. The first and the
                    fifth were completed respectively in 1882 and 1883. But when the second volume
                    appeared in 1887, Hermann Barsdorf, who had acquired Duncker and thus the rights
                    to the old translations, filed suit on the grounds that the new volume relied
                    too heavily on Strodtmann. It was in this context that Brandes published his
                    account. The case passed through several courts, concluding in 1889 when the
                        <em>Reichsgericht</em> ruled in Barsdorf’s favor. He was therefore permitted
                    to continue to sell the published and the revised translations for which he
                    himself made provision. They were priced much cheaper than Veit and Co.’s
                    revised editions, which consequently sold poorly.</p>
                <p>When Brandes published his <em>Gesammelte Schriften</em> with Langen in 1902, he
                    returned to the Barsdorf conflict in his foreword: </p>
                <blockquote> The majority of the books published in Germany with my name on the
                    title page are books I have never seen, much less examined or published (...) A
                    thrifty publisher, whose reputation does not at all correspond to his vigor, has
                    acquired my entire authorship in German against my will and in spite of nearly
                    twenty years of protest on my part; he has treated my books as he desired,
                    equipped them with ballyhooed and arbitrarily chosen titles, supplied them with
                    additions and supplements, or cut the majority of them to pieces and thus sold
                    them on the retail market. I must here once again state what I have so often
                    expressed, that I do not have the most minimal relationship to the innumerable
                    books Hr. Barsdorf of Leipzig has published under my name, and would never
                    acknowledge them as my own (In Danish in Brandes 1906:285-9; cited portion 287). </blockquote>

                    <h2>d. The Key Biographical Concept of “Experience” </h2>
                    <p> The following series of citations provides examples of how Brandes found his
                        way to the category of “experience” as a central explanatory factor that
                        secured causality in a positivistic sense while at the same time narrowing
                        in the form of integration toward the biographical frame. The point of
                        departure is the account Brandes provided in the summer of 1887 during the
                        conflict with Barsdorf, in which he explained how his aesthetics, and
                        therefore his construction of Main Currents, changed along the way.</p>

                        and therefore his construction of <em>Main Currents</em>, changed along the
                        way.</p>
                    <p>“A Letter from Dr. G. Brandes,” <em>Politiken</em> July 4, 1887:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p> The central understanding of aesthetics has changed since 1873. </p>
                        <p> At that time my conception of history was still abstract. I evaluated
                            literature before all as an intellectual orientation. My understanding
                            of <em>freedom</em> and <em>progress</em> was still doctrinaire. My own
                            combative position endangered my impartiality. Thus my judgement of the
                            Romantics was determined especially by their religious and political
                            attitudes. There was much less to say regarding their talent.</p>
                        <p>This is now completely changed. By virtue of innumerable interpolations,
                            excisions, changes, in many cases of small size yet consequential, an
                            entirely different poetics and historical understanding have come into
                            being (...) </p>
                        <p>When I began to work on Main Currents in 1871, I was in my intellectual
                            orientation still metaphysically minded. I overlooked the personalities;
                            they were only the organs of the Ideas. As the title indicates, I was
                            interested only in the <em>currents</em> of the world of ideas. The
                            individualities were carried along by the currents, pulled apart by
                            them; they were the spokespersons of the ideas. The personalities
                            remained uninteresting to the author.</p>
                        <p>Thus not a single biographical sketch is found in the first part of the
                            oldest edition of <em>Main Currents</em>.</p>
                        <p>In the old edition of the second part there is progress, in that the
                            biographies are Included, but as a rule they are short and incomplete
                            and -- as is wholly characteristic – they are in general tacked on at
                            the end as supplements less important than the portrayal of the
                            works.</p>
                        <p>First the works are reviewed, such that when the whole intellectual life
                            of the person is characterized, there follows, as noted, a short
                            description of the life of the personality, in which all that is
                            portrayed has its roots. The works do not unfold themselves from these
                            roots. They are breathed into life by the ideas. The human being, this
                            “slack” that is left over when the ideas are treated, this nonetheless
                            indispensable slack, was in the end included as a necessary evil.
                            Compare for example the treatment of Kleist.</p>
                        <p> There is therefore not a single actual portrait found in the book. I was
                            not capable of doing as much. </p>
                        <p>It was only much later that I learned that precisely on this point I was
                            possessed of a strength. And when I no longer subscribed to the Hegelian
                            contempt for the individual, no longer believed that the abstract world
                            spirit brought forth the works, I began to immerse myself in the
                            historical personalities and show <em>how their production followed from
                                their lives</em> (...) </p>
                        <p>Therefore: the task of the work, which initially was to agitate, became
                            purely scientific in the second edition, what was national and Danish
                            became universal. The understanding of poetry and art was at that time
                            conditioned by the tendentiousness; it is now otherwise. Ultimately the
                            relation between the ideas and the personalities has been reversed, and
                            to this change corresponds the wholly distinct composition of the work.

                    <p> Brandes’ article was a partisan brief in a legal conflict, so it was useful
                        for him to trace the lines precisely and to prove how <em>thorough</em>
                        going the changes had been. Yet it is however evident that the biographical
                        approach appears in various preliminary forms and variants in the previously
                        published editions, and at the same time that his eye for the currents has
                        hardly vanished completely in the final volume or in the revised editions
                        already undertaken. But it is important to recall that the majority of the
                        translations of <em>Main Currents</em> to foreign languages relied on the
                        revised editions, while in the case of Germany it was presumably the
                        translations from the original editions that circulated most widely.</p>

                        how, step by step, Brandes established the structure by which the noun
                        “experience” [Da. oplevelse, Ger. Erlebnis] entered the language, it having
                        appeared for the first time in Danish in his 1877 monograph on Kierkegaard. </p>

                                    amply testified by the immensity of the forthcoming production.
                                    For there is of course no feeling, no passion and no suffering
                                    in anything that has not lived within the heart of the author.

                                <p>There are creative spirits who require much great fortune or
                                    experiences [oplevelser] in order to produce a minor work. These
                                    are the kinds of poets who produce a drop of rose oil from
                                    hundreds of pounds of rose leaves. And on the other hand there
                                    are talents whose nature is so fruitful, whose inner climate is
                                    so tropical, that out of the wholly peculiar conditions of daily
                                    life they experience [opleve] with the highest energies they are
                                    able to draw out a whole series of significant works. They
                                    resemble the treeless islands of the South Seas, on which
                                    passengers from a passing ship leave a few fruit seeds and which
                                    many years later are covered with mighty forests.</p>
                                <p>Kierkegaard belonged to the latter type. He was unreceptive to
                                    the great mass of life impressions, because early on only a
                                    handful of them so entranced him that he could never escape them
                                    or create space for new ones. He had the poet’s need to diffuse
                                    himself, to send out a host of different figures from the
                                    enclosure of his personality. Yet at the same time he did not
                                    possess the poetic powers to provide, through a complete
                                    transformation of his life impressions, an independent life for
                                    them outside of the various figures, figures that appeared in an
                                    abundance of forms that were either irrelevant to him or only
                                    emerged from situations alien or heterogeneous to his
                                    personality. Instead of transforming his life impressions he
                                    only recast them; instead of transforming himself he disguised
                                    or masked himself. He never concentrated himself as intensely as
                                    his mere thoughts, he never diffused himself as intensely as
                                    does the true poet (Brandes 1877:76-8). </p>

                    <p>The citation from the book on Kierkegaard reveals the path toward the
                        principle in what was then a groundbreaking work. It was Brandes’ first book
                        dedicated to a single authorship, the aim of which was to provide an account
                        of Kierkegaard’s production by showing the works to be reflections on the
                        decisive events or “experiences” of his life and development: his relation
                        to his father, to The Corsair and to Regine Olsen. Brandes sought – and
                        found – the decisive genetic connection between life and work in the
                        experiences that conditioned the poetry. Moreover, the understanding of
                        causality with which Brandes operated was in no way simplified. His
                        differentiated elucidation of the relationship between desire and powers,
                        between thinkers and poets, is quite noteworthy, and thus the Kierkegaard

                    <h2>e. Example: The Portrait of Byron</h2>
                    <p> The change in his methodological and ideological approach can be clarified
                        by looking at Brandes’ understanding of the key figure of Byron.</p>
                    <p>Already in the introductory lecture, Byron was introduced as the man who
                        brings about the reversal in the great drama: “the Greek War of Independence
                        breaks out, and a breath of fresh air travels throughout Europe; Byron falls
                        a hero for the Greek cause, and his heroic deed makes an enormous impression
                        on all the writers of the Continent” (Brandes 1872:13). </p>
                    <p>In April and May of 1872, some months after publication, Brandes gave six
                        lectures on recent French drama. At the conclusion of the first lecture, he
                        reiterates and expands the central position of Byron as an expression and a
                        summation of the liberal movement:</p>
                    <blockquote>But in Byron himself the spirit of rebellion was incarnated. In his
                        birth, his bodily development, his war against the pharisaic public opinion
                        of England, his Rousseau- influenced love of nature, his hatred of
                        civilization, which to him did not seem to have birthed any other fruits
                        than pestilence and cancer, war and immorality, he stood outside of society
                        (...) American republicanism, German freethinking, French rebelliousness,
                        Anglo-Saxon radicalism seemed to be united in this one intellect. His death
                        was a boon to the universal cause of freedom. The Holy Alliance seemed to
                        have cowed the spirit of revolution for all time. Every bond that connected
                        the Restoration to the Revolution was severed. Then this poet tied together
                        the threads that had required a million soldiers to cut apart. When the
                        rebellion had been suppressed in all countries, when the press had been
                        gagged, when science had humbled and subjected itself, this son of the
                        imagination, this poet as free as the air, entered himself into the lists
                        and so awakened the spirit of the previous century (here cited from Fenger
                        1978:102-3). </blockquote>

                    <p>This vision is reiterated and modified in <em>The Reaction in France</em>
                        (1874), in which Brandes in part compares literary types and in part
                        summarily goes back and forth between them and the historic personages of
                        Napoleon and Byron:</p>
                    <blockquote> Napoleon had displaced Werther, René and Faust, Byron’s promethean
                        and desperate heroism displaced Napoleon. He accorded wonderfully with the
                        demand of the age (...) It was the spirit of rebellion that radiated from
                        him and through his mouth united the young generation to a society of world
                        citizenship (,,,) Byron let loose all passions. It was not for him to attack
                        at a single point, but to revolutionize the minds, to awaken indignation at
                        tyranny. The Holy Alliance believed (...) (Brandes 1874:348-9). </blockquote>

                    <p>The point at which the citation ends is followed by a few lines in accordance
                        with what Brandes had said in the spring 1872 lecture series, but in the
                        published citation it is now marked with a citation from Gervinus’
                            <em>Geschichte des 19. Jahrhunderts seit den Wiener Verträgen</em>.
                        Brandes relies on the view of the post-Hegelian Gervinus, according to which
                        the great individuals of history can only be understood in their context,
                        that the leader is only the leader of the masses, because he is an
                        expression of a tendency of development in society.</p>
                    <p>In <em>Naturalism in England</em> Brandes has escaped the post-Hegelian view
                        and the practice of comparative characterization in favor of an
                        interpretation grounded in biography.</p>
                    <p> The material on Byron consumes the last six chapters of the book, in all
                        more than 170 pages. In the previous volumes of <em>Main Currents</em>
                        Brandes had employed themes or problematics as chapter titles, but with his
                        portrait of Byron the name of the author is placed within the chapter
                        titles. This was the longest piece Brandes had until then written on a
                        single person, and in contrast to his previous work the first to be built up
                        purely biographically. Byron’s history of development is portrayed with
                        emphasis on his parents and upbringing, especially the decisive events and
                        their significance in interplay with his character traits. The meaningful
                        traits are not reflected against society, but in relation to the development
                        of his personality. Brandes summarizes the troubles from which he emerged by
                        noting that they “acquired their significance by early on driving Byron, who
                        as a young aristocrat could easily have occupied himself with the
                        sensibilities of his class and kin, exclusively toward the resources of the
                        single, isolated personality” (Brandes 1875:378).</p>
                    <p> The event which “acquired decisive meaning in his life” (Brandes 1875:469)
                        was falling in love with young Teresa Guiccioli. The portrait is constructed
                        such that Byron’s life history proceeds from the desire for freedom, from
                        society toward solitude and from culture toward nature. Byron sought escape
                        from society toward “localities outside of civilization, where individuality
                        could develop itself freely and without regard to any conventional
                        strictures” (Brandes 1875:389). “He, who descended in a straight line from
                        Rousseau, felt himself powerfully drawn to all the people living in a
                        ‘natural state’” (Brandes 1875:390). Feudal Albania became that “nature” in
                        which the individuality and true humanity of the free world citizen could
                        unfold itself. “He now grasped freedom in the wide and full and universally
                        human sense of the word. He now sensed that free thought is the point of
                        departure for all life of the spirit (Brandes 1875:429).</p>
                    <p>The section “Byron. The Self-Absorption of the I,” thus concludes:</p>
                    <blockquote> Thus the poet conducts his worship service and gathers his soul in
                        devotions. He renounces all “houses of idols,” Gothic churches as well as
                        Greek temples, and like the Ancient Persians built their alters on the
                        highest mountains overlooking the earth, he bows his head in the great
                        church of nature, which consists of the earth and the air (Brandes
                        1875:433). </blockquote>

                    <p>Byron here does not just reject culture, for nature becomes a paradise and
                        the human being as primordial as Adam. Brandes refers here to the
                        “ur-history of the race.” Logically enough, the revolutionary spirit
                        culminates atop the Alps:</p>
                    <blockquote> On the lonely heights above the snow line, where human weakness and
                        pliability no longer thrive, where his soul first breathes freely, and the
                        Alpine landscape by the necessity of nature forms the frame round his hero
                        who in his stern wildness is akin to it (Brandes 1875:446-7). </blockquote>

                    <p>Characteristic of the biographical interpretation is that it is precisely at
                        this point that Brandes by virtue of his own experiences inserts himself
                        into Byron’s situation:</p>
                    <blockquote> I recall that one evening I stood on Rigi Kulm and observed the
                        lovely lakes at the foot of the mountain, and the small clouds that far down
                        passed over them . . . It was visions of nature such as this that provided
                        the material for the apparitions that overcame Manfred. Passage after
                        passage of Byron’s journal is incorporated into his poem. (Brandes
                        1875:436-7). </blockquote>
                    <p>(Brandes cites from the article “A Few Notes on Travel. (From a Diary)” in
                            <em>Illustreret Tidende</em>, May 2, 1869:262; the article is based on a
                        letter to his parents dated August 14, 1868, published in Brandes
                        1978:196-8).</p>

                    <p>It is notable that “experience” now functions in two positions. In the first
                        place as an element in that which is understood, in that experience becomes
                        the measure to which the literary work can be causally traced back; here the
                        frame of understanding is defined as biography. In the second place
                        experience functions as understanding in and of itself, as the hermeneutic
                        element or the similarity that conditions the relation between the object
                        and the interpreting or understanding subject, here Brandes’ corresponding
                        experiences atop Rigi Kulm.</p>
                    <p>The chapter on Byron contains the paradoxical trait that Brandes, who is
                        wholly in revolt against Romanticism, chooses a Romantic. A foundational
                        trait here – as already evident in the introductory lecture – is that it is
                        the reactionary social system that forces the seeker of freedom to choose
                        solitude; in later iterations solitude acquires absolute value, while family
                        and society are portrayed as destructive of the personality. </p>
                    <p> In <em>The Romantic School in France</em> (1882), this problematic receives
                        a peculiar treatment in a contrasting of George Sand and Naturalism (the
                        Balzac school, Zola):</p>
                    <blockquote> Whenever Emile Zola registered his objections against the
                        idealistic novel, he never forgot to point out the dangers that this
                        continual aspiration beyond the bounds which restrain the individual, this
                        repeated desire for greater intellectual and emotional freedom, pose to the
                        family and to society (...) He could have added that he and his successors
                        in the Balzac school have never at all had need of a higher morality than
                        the ordinary, and that they have never opened up a vision of society
                        different from that which exists. They have subjected themselves to a
                        violent constriction, in that they have committed themselves to the
                        depiction of the external realities observable to them and refused to draw
                        any conclusions therefrom (Brandes 1882:198-9). </blockquote>
                    <p>If literature and human beings are only products of circumstances, then the
                        world cannot be changed; thus Positivism and Naturalism become that which in
                        his dissertation Brandes had called “quietistic,” e.g. without feeling,
                        disengaged (Brandes 1870b:173). Only when human beings are free, the
                        possibility of critique as appeal is opened. Thus the world can be changed.
                        If literature ought to criticize society, it cannot manage to do so by being
                        an expression of it. “The only literature that is alive today is one that
                        provokes debate” – the provocative declaration in the introduction to
                        Emigrant Literature (Brandes 1872a:15) is a profound red thread in all six
                        volumes of <em>Main Currents</em></p>

                <h1 id="editions">5. Editions and Translations</h1>
                <p> Between 1872 and Brandes’ death in 1927, <em>Main Currents</em> was published in
                    five Danish editions, the last in 1923-4. Thus some 14,250 copies were
                    circulated, although <em>Emigrant Literature</em> was issued in 15,250 copies,
                    since the first volume was early on, in 1877, published as a revised edition.
                    Apart the from the fourth printing in 1906, Brandes revised each of the new
                    editions.</p>
                <p> The German edition was introduced already in 1872, thanks to Adolf Strodtmann’s
                    translation for Duncker of Berlin. The next three volumes appeared in 1873, 1874
                    and 1876; after Strodtmann’s death in 1879, the final two volumes of<em> Die
                        Hauptströmungen der Literatur des neunzehten Jahrhunderts</em>, translated
                    by W. Rudow and A. v. D. Linden, appeared in 1886 and 1896.</p>
                <p> When Brandes began to revise the individual volumes and, as previously noted,
                    signed a new contract with Veit &amp; Co. of Leipzig in 1880 for <em>Die
                        Literatur des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts in ihren Hauptströmungen
                        dargestellt</em>, this resulted in a court case that Brandes lost. The 1887
                    account of the revisions cited previously was a brief in this case.</p>
                <p> At long last, in 1924, a “Vom Verfasser neu bearbeitete endgültige Ausgabe,”
                    translated by Ernst Richard Eckert, was published by Erich Reiss in Berlin in
                    three, closely printed volumes. The third volume includes a detailed index.</p>
                <p> The German Duncker editions provided the foundation for the <em>Polish</em>
                    translations of the five first editions (1881-5), and likewise for the Russian
                    versions of the four first editions (1891-3). A translation from the Danish,
                    edited by M.V. Lucickaja, was published in Kiev in 1902-3. The fourth volume was
                    translated from German by E. Zauer and published with a foreword by E.A. Solevev
                    in Saint Petersburg in 1898; the other volumes, from German translations, were
                    also published by different translators between 1895 and 1900. </p>
                <p> Brandes’ <em>Collected Writings</em> were published in Russian in twelve volumes
                    in 1902-3; volumes three to eleven contain <em>Main Currents</em>. The whole
                    collection appeared in a revised and expanded edition between 1906 and 1914; of
                    the twenty volumes, five through twelve contain <em>Main Currents</em>.</p>
                <p> A Spanish edition in two volumes, which however contained all six of the
                    original books, appeared in Buenos Aires in 1946.</p>
                <p> It was the appearance of Brandes’ <em>William Shakespeare </em>(3 vols., 1895-6)
                    in English translation in 1896 that opened the English and American markets to
                    his books, and thereafter, those of India and Japan. <em>Main Currents in
                        European Literature</em>, translated by Diana White and Mary Morison,
                    appeared in London in six volumes between 1901 and 1905; illustrations were
                    added in a 1906 edition, which was reissued in 1923 and 1924; in 1975 the
                    edition was reprinted in New York. The introduction to the work in the English
                    editions is reduced to three and a half pages. The third volume, <em>The
                        Reaction in France</em>, was separately reissued in 1960, the fourth,
                        <em>Naturalism in England</em>, in 1957 and 1960, and the fifth in 1966.</p>
                <p> A Japanese edition of <em>Main Currents</em> appeared in Tokyo in 1915,
                    translated by Junsuku Suita. It was reissued in 1929 and then revised by S.
                    Fukushima in 1953-4. Brandes’ foreword to the Japanese edition appears in Danish
                    in <em>Napoleon and Garibaldi</em> (1917:257-61). </p>
                <p> A Chinese edition of the first four volumes was published in Shanghai in 1936,
                    translated from the English editions by Han Shiheng, who also made use of the
                    Japanese edition. A Chinese edition of all six volumes appeared between 1980 and
                    1986, reissued in 1997 and 2018.</p>
                <p> A Yiddish translation in eleven volumes was published in Warsaw between 1918 and
                    1921.</p>
                <p> Beyond the complete editions of Main Currents, individual volumes have been
                    translated to other languages. <em>Emigrant Literature</em> was made available
                    in Finnish in 1887. <em>Den romantiske Skole i Frankrig</em> er oversat til
                    tjekkisk (1894) og til fransk (1902). </p>

                    His discussion of the individual volumes of <em>Main Currents</em> can be

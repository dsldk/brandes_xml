                <p>In an age in which globalization has intensified both the meeting of cultures and
                    the clash between them, there is a need for historical perspective and insight.
                    Georg Brandes’ principal work, <em>Main Currents in Nineteenth Century
                        Literature</em>, is a crucial source of inspiration and discussion of the
                    relation between the familiar and the foreign, and it is now published at
                    www.georgbrandes.dk, in a scientific, multi-lingual edition accompanied by
                    supplementary resources and tools.</p>

                <p> “The surest way for a beginning Danish writer to make a name is still, as it was
                    24 years ago, to write something or other against me,” declared a self-conscious
                    Georg Brandes in 1895 (“The Circumstances of a Danish Author,”
                        <em>Politiken</em>, March 2, 1895). These words are still applicable today,
                    as Brandes continues to evoke powerful attitudes and feelings in Danish public
                    discourse. He is still a continuous presence in that forum, as one of the few
                    surviving voices of the 19th century. He has managed to sow division ever since
                    he first stepped up to the lectern in auditorium 7 in the main building of
                    Copenhagen University, on November 3, 1871 at 6:00 PM, thereby inaugurating his
                    series of lectures on recent European literature, <em>Main Currents Nineteenth
                        Century Literature</em>, which was published in book form between 1872 and
                    1890. In and of itself this is a noteworthy achievement. Yet the local uproar
                    over the lectures has also tended to overshadow the literary work itself, which
                    provoked both the conflicts at home as well as the immense and complicated
                    international afterlife of the work. The research and publication project
                        <em>Digital Currents</em> provides new contributions and tools for research
                    in both respects.</p>

                <h1 id="maincurrents">2. <em>Main Currents</em></h1>


                <p>Brandes’ <em>Main Currents in Nineteenth Century Literature </em>was at the same
                    time an academic exercise and a work of engaged cultural critique. The work
                    addresses the (literary) history of Europe’s main countries, but also the
                    provincial nature of contemporary Danish intellectual life. The drama was thus
                    viewed by the by the Danish public as a kind of test piece: “I believe, that we
                    can draw a lesson for ourselves from this great drama. We are now, as usual,
                    forty years behind Europe,” wrote Brandes, making use of the national “we,”
                    which clearly emerges as the addressee. Denmark was for Brandes indeed unique in
                    the European context, but in a negative sense: “Nowhere in Europe are there so
                    many exalted ideals and, in few places, a flatter spiritual life,” he asserted
                    polemically (“Introduction” in <em>Main Currents ...</em> vol. 1: Emigrant
                    Literature, 1872, p. 25).</p>
                <p>With this he has further defined a role for himself in the national drama: as the
                    one who would spur especially the authors to action and to persuade them to
                    write in a manner close to reality and engaged with the times. He would urge
                    them to “provoke debate,” an expression that immediately became a cliché – and
                    still is to this day. With this intervention Brandes inaugurated a new era in
                    Denmark, “the Modern Breakthrough,” as he would later deem it. One of the
                    authors of the Modern Breakthrough, Nobel laureate Henrik Pontoppidan, speaks in
                    his novel <em>Lucky Per</em> (1898-1904, 1905) of the “European cultural wave”
                    that Brandes (in the novel portrayed as Dr. Nathan) had been able to unleash
                    over the country.” The wave had engendered “a series of revolutionary poets,
                    scientists and politicians” at the same time that “in the purely practical
                    domain” it had “brought forth a surge of youthful and bold energy that sought
                    outlets” (<em>Lucky Per</em>, 4th edition, 1918, vol. 1, p. 333). This burst of
                    energy is seen by the novels main character, the engineering student Per
                    Sidenius, as only one of the innumerable consequences of Brandes’ movement. The
                    Modern Breakthrough was further much more than a purely literary phenomenon, a
                    kind of umbrella category encompassing a long series of modernization processes
                    as well as a sustained and closer engagement and exchange with the outside
                    world, especially within the domains of culture and science.</p>

                        resembled me. It recalls a Russian Nihilist immediately before his hanging.
                        But every photograph can produce a likeness; as a drawing the picture is
                        quite good. Yet that there should be something here that does resemble me, I
                        write down this sentence from my book Main Currents (V 497): It is the
                        critic who moves mountains, all the mountains of blind faith in authority,
                        prejudice, the intellectual emptiness of power and the transmission of the
                        dead past.”</em>

                <p>Although<em> Main Currents</em> was initially conceived as an intervention in and
                    attack on the local Danish cultural situation, it was however a larger, European
                    story Brandes related: the story of the great national literatures – the French,
                    German and English – their distinguishing traits, their mutual codependence and
                    their receptiveness to impulses from abroad. And this so engaged and interested
                    him that he reached out to a broader and more international public than any
                    Danish humanist before or since. Brandes was translated into 17 languages,
                        <em>Main Currents </em> alone appearing during his lifetime in Danish,
                    German, English, Russian, Polish, Yiddish and Japanese, while individual volumes
                    of the series were also published in Finnish and French. After his death it has
                    also come out in Spanish and Chinese. Very few Danish authors have had a
                    corresponding impact: H.C. Andersen, Søren Kierkegaard, Isak Dinesen.</p>
                <p>Compared to this distinguished company, Brandes’ fame is distinct in that it was
                    to a large extent tied to his particular era, and when his fame was it at its
                    peak, it was more intense than any experienced before or after. He has – in the
                    words of literary scholar Paul V. Rubow – “without comparison been the Dane who
                    has been heard abroad” (“Georg Brandes,” <em>Danish Biographical Lexicon</em>,
                    3rd edition, 1979, vol. 2, p. 459). As public speaker he toured constantly, and
                    in 1912 alone he spoke in 42 European cities.</p>
                <p>Through his journalism and his criticism published in newspapers, Brandes further
                    understood how to make himself relevant to the new and fast moving media
                    environment. But just as importantly, he succeeded – as speaker, journalist and
                    author – in making an impression on the generation on the cusp of the century of
                    globalization – and world war. When Brandes died, the German author and Nobel
                    laureate Thomas Mann said that around 1900, <em>Main Currents</em> had been “the
                    bible of the young intellectuals of Europe” (Thomas Mann, “A Master of
                    Productive Criticism,” <em>Politiken</em>, February 20, 1927. And Brandes was a
                    genuine European, indeed “the Good European,” as he was deemed by the German
                    philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, whom Brandes had “discovered” and popularized
                    around 1890 (Letter from Nietzsche to Brandes, Nice, December 2, 1887, in Paul
                    Krüger (publisher): <em>Correspondence of Georg Brandes</em>, 1966, vol. 3, p.

                <p>Toward the end of his life, Brandes the European experienced the dawn of
                    globalization – his own authorship included. With a measure of
                    self-satisfaction, Brandes made this clear in a reckoning of his status: “I have
                    my readers in Europe, Asia and America. I am of a different nature than those
                    who address themselves to the Danish bourgeoisie (Georg Brandes: "Georg Brandes
                    and Social Democracy. A contribution from Georg Brandes on the occasion of
                    Social Minister Borgbjerg’s speech,” in <em>Social-Demokraten</em>, November 22,
                    1924). In situation such as this, Brandes sensed a new and difficult task for
                    himself, which was expressed in the foreword to the Japanese edition of <em>Main
                        Currents</em> (1915): </p>
                <blockquote><em>Main Currents</em> begins with the old fable of ‘The Raven and the
                    Stork.’ The work would open up the perspective of the various European nations
                    to the advantages of one another, serve the raven’s dishes on the stork’s table
                    and vice versa. Now the fable applies more broadly. It would please the author
                    of <em>Main Currents</em> if he had served European intellectual nourishment in
                    such a manner that it might now be appropriated by the Japanese palette
                    (“Foreword to the Japanese Edition of <em>Main Currents</em>”,
                        <em>Politiken</em>, July 23, 1915)</blockquote>
                <p>Good luck with that! Whereas the work had first attempted to compare and tie
                    together European cultures, now Brandes understood that it was matter of
                    fostering an intercontinental dialog. This broadening of horizons was a
                    reflection of a developing situation in which cultures, crises and wars were
                    becoming globalized. The First World War (1914-1918) was a pressing example of
                    this, and Brandes’ critical engagement with the conflict turned him into a
                    global player whose commentaries on its unfolding developments were constantly
                    in demand in all the world’s newspapers. It is especially the international
                    perspective and afterlife of the authorship that <em>Digital Currents</em> would
                    draw attention to. </p>

                <p>The first scientific edition of Brandes’ main work that the project has
                    established is also its first digital edition. It is addressed to the specialist
                    and the layperson, both in Denmark and abroad. In order to assist the reader in
                    grasping the significance of the work, a series of advanced viewing applications
                    and resources have been produced for the edition: translations, commentaries,
                    indexes, links to dictionaries, and detailed introductions to all the texts,
                    written by an interdisciplinary research group, that place <em>Main
                        Currents</em> in new disciplinary and cultural historical contexts. The
                    projects documentation and study of Brandes’ principal text on the critical as
                    well as emancipatory potential of internationalization and the meeting of
                    cultures is especially interesting to us in two contexts in which Main Currents
                    was pioneering work; in the first place its role in the development of
                    comparative literature as an internationally oriented field, in the second its
                    role in the formulation of a modern European identity. Both the one and the
                    other are relevant to the globalized present in which disciplinary traditions as
                    well as geopolitical constellations are under stress. And current events have on
                    the whole substantiated Brandes theorizing and practice of his dual roles: as
                    scientist and “intellectual” – to employ the term Brandes himself introduced
                    into Danish – and as Dane and world citizen.</p>

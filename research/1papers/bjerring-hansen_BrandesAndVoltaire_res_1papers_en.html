                <h3>Fremmede blikke. Ekkoer fra 1700-tallet hos Georg Brandes (2018)</h3>
                <p>by <span class="author">Jens Bjerring-Hansen</span></p>
                <p>In the famous introduction to his series of lectures on <em>Main Currents of Nineteenth Century
                    Literature</em> (published 1872–90) Georg Brandes (1842–1927) announced the necessity of
                    an epochal transformation of the cultural and literary backwater of Denmark and the Nordic
                    region as well as of a modern scientific approach to literary phenomena. Rhetorically
                    and philosophically, this call for modernization was, however, also informed by texts and
                    arguments from the Enlightenment of the eighteenth century, notably Voltaire’s <em>Micromégas</em>
                    (1752). Brandes’ lifelong appropriation of the sci-fi novella sheds light on the legacy of
                    the Enlightenment on his authorship, more specifically concerning his comparatist agenda
                    as a literary critic and his cosmopolitan outlook as a politically engaged intellectual.</p>
                <p>Originally published in: <em>Danske Studier</em> 2018, pp. 69-88.</p>

                    <h2>1.1. Plan of the Edition</h2>
                    <p> The edition of Georg Brandes' <em>Main Currents in Nineteenth Century
                            Literature</em> (1872-1890) is a critical textual and annotated digital
                        edition.</p>
                    <p>The primary audience of the edition is academic, that is to say researchers,
                        students and those particularly interested in the material, but through the
                        medium of electronic publication we hope to reach a broader readership,
                        which by virtue of the English version of the site, thus becomes
                        international.</p>
                    <p>The first editions of the six volumes of Brandes’ work serve as the textual
                        basis, and the edition is supplied with a selective variant apparatus that
                        illuminates the changes Brandes made in later editions. Added to this are
                        detailed research-based introductions to the individual volumes of <em>Main
                            Currents</em>, indexes of persons, works, literary characters and
                        places, linking to the DSL’s dictionaries, search functions, a timelineof
                        Brandes’ life and international activities, and various resource texts:
                        German, English and French translations of the work as well as Brandes’
                            <em>Explanation and Defense</em> (1872) and autobiographical
                            <em>Memoirs</em> 1-3 (1905-1908).</p>
                    <p>Also on the domain georgbrandes.dk is an exploration of <em>Main
                            Currents</em> as a comparative literary and cultural critical event,
                        which has been carried out within the parameters of the research project.
                        The project’s experiments with digital methods of textual analysis are also
                        documented.</p>
                    <p>The chief editor of the edition and website has been Jens Bjerring-Hansen
                        (University of Copenhagen). See full list of staff, contributors and

                    <h2>2.1. Texts</h2>
                    <p>The edition consists of three groups of texts, including the Danish original
                        edition of <em>HS</em> 1-6 and two types of supplementary resource texts,
                        translations of <em>HS</em> to German, English and French and
                        autobiographical writings</p>
                    <p>Georg Brandes’ <em>Main Currents in Nineteenth Century Literature</em> was
                        published in Copenhagen in six volumes between 1872 and 1890, through the
                        publisher Gyldendal. Each of the six volumes was further published in
                        numerous new editions and translations during the lifetime of the author.
                        The author’s manuscripts are only partially preserved for posterity.</p>

                    <p>The edition is digital, but its scale can be grasped by considering the
                        published books: 10, 232 book pages of text in all (with relatively compact
                        pages of circa 1200-1500 characters with spacing).</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>HS</em> 1-6 (2720 book pages in total)</li>
                        <li><em>HS</em> translations to German (2850 pages), English (2.900 pages),

                    </ul>
                    <p>To this is added the secondary material of the editions: introductions to the
                        individual texts, critical textual notes, historical and verbal
                        commentaries, critical apparatus, publication history, user guides etc.</p>

                    <p>The philological work was performed by specialists at the DSL. This work
                        involves:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Selection of textual basis,</li>
                        <li>collation of texts,</li>
                        <li>preparation of text (including emendation, that is correction of errors
                            in the original text, for example typographical and typesetting
                            errors),</li>
                        <li>critical textual notes (with explanations for the corrections that the
                            editors have made to the original text),</li>

                        <li>indexing and establishing of databases on persons, works, places and
                            literary characters,</li>
                        <li>preparation of (selective) critical apparatuses (with documentation of
                            the most important changes made to <em>HS</em> in later editions from
                            the author’s lifetime),</li>
                        <li>accounts of publication history (with accounts of the relevant
                            manuscripts and editions, together with bibliographic descriptions of
                            the editions that function as the foundation of the new edition, as well
                            as</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>However, not all of the texts receive identical treatment:</p>

                        <li>The translations of <em>HS</em> are not reproduced with textual
                            criticism, but only as proofread OCR-scanner text. They are not
                            commented upon and are accompanied only by brief introductions (by the
                            DSL editors).</li>
                        <li>The biographical resource texts are reproduced with textual criticism,
                            but in contrast to the Danish HS editions are not commented upon. They
                            are accompanied by brief introductions.</li>

                    <h2>3.1. Coding and Markup</h2>
                    <p>The project follows the DSL’s coding manual, developed by Thomas Hansen in
                        dialogue with digital publication projects at the DSL. The manual is based
                        on the latest TEI standard (P5). The manual is adapted to the particular
                        demands of the DigHo. In general, the Brandes texts are simple in structure,
                        without many content elements. However, some of the IT solutions to
                        philological problems deserve special consideration. This is true for the
                        critical apparatus (see section 6) as well as the digital indexes (see
                        section 7.2).</p>

                    <h2>3.2. Publicering</h2>
                    <p>The text is digitally published on DigHo’s domain, www.georgbrandes.dk (see
                        section 10).</p>

            </div>
            <div class="chapter">
                <h1 id="sourcetext">4. Selection of Source Text</h1>
                <p>The basis of the edition is the first published version of Georg Brandes’ books
                    (first editions). The Danish texts are reproduced in facsimile (that is with
                    digital image scanning), with the possibility of parallel viewing with the
                    electronic text.</p>
                <p>The selection of the first edition as textual basis– and the textual-sociological
                    point of departure – is in line with current (new) philological author editions
                    in Scandinavia (for example, Ludvig Holberg’s Writings, Grundtvig’s works,
                    Henrik Ibsen’s Writings and the Selma Lagerlöf Archive). In this sense the
                    selection is a natural extension of the project’s overriding sociological
                    interest in <em>Main Currents</em> as a public event and cultural critical
                    intervention. It was the first edition with which the public made acquaintance,
                    and which immediately launched a new epoch, provoking jubilation and fury. The
                    attention to the historical re-contextualization of the work weighs more heavily
                    than an evaluation of its quality, which would redound to the advantage of the
                    later, revised editions.#</p>

                    <h2>5.1. General Principles</h2>
                    <p>The texts are as a starting point prepared without modernization (that is
                        with the preservation of the original orthography and punctuation) and
                        without normalization (that is without resolving inconsistencies in the
                        author’s orthography and punctuation). In the interest of readability,
                        however, certain older or inconsistent norms of typography and punctuation –
                        without influencing the meaning – are presented according to more modern
                        and/or consistent principles. This harmonization applies to the following
                        factors: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>typography</li>
                        <ol style="list-style-type:circle;">
                            <li>Spacing as a means of emphasis is presented with italics; the very
                                few examples of italics (in HS, vol. 6) used as an emphatic marker
                                or etymological signal are likewise reproduced with italics. </li>
                            <li>The page transitions and line breaks of the original are not
                                imitated, but the original pagination is noted.</li>
                            <li>Page titles (continuous headers) and sheet signatures are not
                                reproduced continuously (see however immediately below with respect
                                to “chapter headings”).</li>
                            <li>The typographical inventory of the original is documented in the
                                digital facsimile.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <li>quotation marks and technique</li>
                        <ol style="list-style-type:circle;">
                            <li>The French quotation marks “«… »” are replaced with the Danish “» …
                                «”.</li>
                            <li>Inserted initial quotation marks for new sections within longer
                                citations are eliminated.</li>
                            <li>Missing quotation marks: the oscillating practice regarding the
                                marking of the conclusion of a citation as well as, rarely, the
                                beginning of one, is harmonized by the insertion of the missing
                                quotation marks. Missing quotation marks are only supplied when
                                clearly lacking. In cases in which there is doubt, the inserted
                                quotation marks are accompanied by a critical textual note.</li>
                            <li>When marking of a break in a citation is missing, for instance due
                                to Brandes insertion of an inquit formula, the text is improved
                                according to modern systematics, ‘… by the insertion of a concluding
                                quotation mark before the break and a beginning quotation mark after
                                the break.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <li>titles of works</li>
                        <ol style="list-style-type:circle;">
                            <li>The staggering practice of marking titles of works is harmonized, so
                                that they are always given with quotation marks: “» … «” In the case
                                of doubt regarding classification (for example “Werther” – book or
                                character?) the uncertainty is noted in a comment. </li>
                        </ol>
                        <li>chapter headings</li>
                        <ol style="list-style-type:circle;">
                            <li>The chapters of <em>Main Currents</em> do not have chapter headings,
                                only a laconic numbering. To assist the reader of DigHo, the topical
                                page titles are inserted as headers for the individual chapters in
                                brackets “ […] ” In the case of volumes 1 and 2, in which there are
                                many page titles per chapter, the first is given as header. A note
                                to the header explains the wording of the page title.</li>

                    <h2>5.2. Emendation og tekstfejl</h2>
                    <p>DigHo corrects textual errors, particularly typesetting and typological
                        errors in the original text (that is the first edition). The edition employs
                        Johnny Kondrup’s definition of a textual error for the emendation: “a
                        textual error is a (historically understood) disruption of the meaning of
                        the text within a closely determined context” (<em>Editionsfilologi</em>,
                        2014, pp. 152-53). The determination of what constitutes a given error is
                        thus not made according to a modern framework, but from a grounded
                        understanding of the point of view of Brandes’ era. Thus when an error is
                        identified, it is corrected in order to reconstruct an understanding of the
                        text corresponding to what the author and his contemporaries would have
                        understood.</p>
                    <p>The edition recognizes three types of errors.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Trivial errors of a typographical nature, for example damaged type,
                            uneven type, unintended typographical space between letters and
                            punctuation signs. Missing quotation marks also belong to this category,
                            when the placement of the mark is evident. These are corrected without
                            notation.</li>
                        <li>Banal errors where the result is a word that cannot exist in the
                            context, and where at the same time it is clear what should be
                            corrected, for example accent inversion, letters out of place or obvious
                            written or typesetting errors ( for example “hum” for “hun,” or, in a
                            given syntactical context “kan” for “han.”) These are corrected without
                            reference to other textual sources.</li>
                        <li>Genuine errors of various kinds, see below. These are corrected after
                            consultation and if possible with documentation from later editions of
                                <em>HS</em> from Brandes’ lifetime. </li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>5.2.1. Emenderingsprocessen</h3>
                    <p>In emending the text, later editions from Brandes’ lifetime are consulted to
                        assist the process of correcting the first edition. If a possibly erroneous
                        wording has been corrected to something more appropriate in a later edition,
                        then there is strong argument that there was indeed an error in the first
                        edition, which is then corrected according to the wording of the later
                        edition. However, the later editions of <em>HS</em> are rewritten to a large
                        extent – especially for the <em>SS</em> [Collected Works] – and they are
                        also harmonized and modernized, so that they cannot always be used as a
                        basis for correction.</p>
                    <p>The manuscript material of <em>HS</em> can also be drawn into the emendation
                        process. Genetic variants – that is changes made to a manuscript during the
                        writing process – are identified in the critical textual notes when they
                        factor in the resolution of a given problem in the first edition (manuscript
                        variants are provided only in such cases, consequentially not in the form of
                        variant notes – see section 6 for the variant apparatus).</p>
                    <p>In the instances in which no textual sources have an acceptable wording, an
                        editorial correction (conjecture) is rendered.</p>
                    <p>In emending the text, Brandes’ own corrigenda pages have been taken into
                        account. Lists of corrections to the first edition are found in the back of
                        later volumes and in other books by Brandes from these decades. Likewise,
                        Brandes’ own corrections in print-ready manuscripts and in copies of the
                        printed editions of (for example, L. Zeuthen’s copy from the KB). All these
                        author’s corrections are sources of corrections, but not proof of textual
                        error.</p>
                    <p>For the presentation of the critical textual notes, see below, section
                        5.3.</p>
                    <h3>5.2.2. Factual Errors (that is, wrong name, date, place etc.)</h3>
                    <p><em>Main Currents</em> was produced in haste, especially the first four
                        volumes (1872-75). The edition documents this, but does not remedy it;
                        corrections are not made even when Brandes is way off the mark. The errors
                        are identified and clarified in the commentaries.</p>
                    <h3>5.2.3. Citation Errors</h3>
                    <p>Citation errors by Brandes are only corrected (from the original source) if
                        the error renders the citation meaningless or gives it a meaning that is
                        clearly in disagreement with the context.</p>
                    <p>Errors that Brandes reproduces from his original texts are normally not
                        corrected. In special cases in which an error is significantly consequential
                        for Brandes’ argumentation, it is supplied with a commentary.</p>
                    <p>Regarding citations from the original language: if Brandes cites the wording
                        from, for example, a specific edition of Taine, it is reproduced unchanged.
                        The inverse applies as well: if Brandes has changed the wording, the changed
                        form is preserved – and if there are essential changes made to the wording,
                        this is noted in a commentary (and not a critical textual note). Adjustments
                        to orthography or the punctuation of the original sources in Brandes’ text
                        are not documented.</p>
                    <p>Regarding citations in translation: if Brandes in translating his citations
                        changes the meaning of the source text, a note is made in a commentary (and
                        not a critical textual note).</p>
                    <p>In general, the attempt to identify and consult the exact sources from which
                        Brandes cites is only made when there is suspicion of textual error or
                        changes to the wording (of a citation in the original language), or a change
                        to the meaning (of a citation in translation). What is reconconstructed is
                        Brandes’ reading and literary horizons rather than his library and loan
                        records (see section 7.1 on the identification of citations in the
                        historical commentary).</p>
                    <p>On the harmonization in DigHo of Brandes’ inconsistent citation see above,
                        section 5.1.</p>
                    <h3>5.2.4 Spelling Errors (foreign language)</h3>
                    <p>When Brandes (or the typesetter) makes in error in the reproduction of a
                        foreign language citation or a proper name, for example inverting French
                        accent marks (aigu and grave), it is corrected as a banal error with a
                        laconic note.</p>
                    <h3>5.2.5. Punctuation Errors</h3>
                    <p>The general principles of correction also apply to punctuation. Regarding
                        emendations without notation, see above, section 5.2.</p>

                    <h2>5.3. Presentation of Critical Notes</h2>
                    <p>Corrections to the base text are documented in critical textual notes.
                        Critical textual considerations can be expressed in a commentary; see
                        examples in sections 5.2.2 and 5.2.3. On the difficulties of documenting the
                        correct alternatives by consulting in later editions of <em>HS</em>, see
                        above, section 5.2.1.</p>
                    <h3>5.3.1. Presentation of Standard Notes</h3>
                    <p>In cases in which an error in the first edition is corrected with reference
                        to a variant from one or more textual sources, these sources’ symbols are
                        given immediately after the lemma sign: ]. On the material situation and the
                        abbreviations used to refer to the individual sources, see above, section
                        2.2</p>
                    <p>Example: Dem] <em>B C SS FU 1923-24</em>, dem <em>A</em>.</p>
                    <p>Where there is no textual source available to reveal the correct text, an
                        editorial correction (conjecture) is made. </p>
                    <p>Example: Dem] dem <em>A B C ms</em>, Deres <em>SS FU 1923-24</em>. </p>
                    <p>In many cases the wording has been changed in later editions to the detriment
                        of the basis for comparison. This is noted in a critical note like this:</p>
                    <p>Example 1: De] de <em>A</em>, changed wording due to revision in <em>B</em>
                        and later editions (<em>Emigrant Literature</em>, p. 123, l. 18)</p>
                    <p>or (as intermediate form)::</p>
                    <p>Example 2: Digterne] Digtene <em>B</em>, changed wording due to revision in
                            <em>C</em> and later editions. (<em>Naturalism in England</em>, p.
                        440)</p>
                    <h3>5.3.2. Notation of Banal Errors</h3>
                    <p>In some cases the critical textual note can be rendered less comprehensive
                        than the standard note. When it involves a banal error, see above, section
                        5.2, a variant from a later edition is not given. In such cases only the
                        erroneous rendering of the original is mentioned in the critical note.</p>

                <p>Georg Brandes’ texts, not least the <em>Main Currents</em>, are dynamic entities
                    that change from edition to edition by virtue of the author’s revisions. This
                    applies to style and orthography, but also to the substance. The author became
                    wiser and better read with respect to his themes, just as he acquired new
                    aesthetic and ideological impulses.</p>
                <p>This variant apparatus is selective, in that a quantitatively defined criterion
                    of essentiality has been adopted in order to determine which variants should be
                    included: two lines of changed text in the form of excisions, additions or
                    rewriting in relation to the first edition. This same pragmatic conception of
                    variance is the basis of Jens Kr. Andersen’s and Chr. Jackson’s “Georg Brandes:
                    Emigrantlitteraturen” (<em>Danske Studier</em>, 1971) and Per Dahl’s preliminary
                    work on a bibliography of Brandes’ authorship. Variants have been identified
                    with the assistance of both digital collation tools and analog control
                    reading.</p>
                <p>In the introductions to each volume of <em>Main Currents</em> a general
                    characterization of the textual variance in the later editions is given along
                    with examples of the variance that has not been included (i.e. shorter than two
                    lines).</p>
                <p>The notes on variance are both classified (as excisions, rewritings or adidtions)
                    and supplied with summary headers, which clarify the character of the revised
                    section, for example “On Byron’s Second Address to Parliament.”</p>
                <p>That which is compared is in all instances the first and second editions of the
                    individual volumes of <em>Main Currents</em>. In certain instances, a German
                    edition was published between two Danish editions and constituted the actual
                    basis of the changes to the second Danish edition. The German variants are not
                    included in the apparatus. For publication history and translation history of
                    the individual volumes, see the Notes on the Publication History, which also
                    includes brief descriptions of the larger changes made to later editions of the
                    individual volumes.</p>

                <h1 id="commentaries">7. Commentaries</h1>
                <p>To date neither <em>HS</em> nor any other of Georg Brandes’ essential works has
                    been published with commentary. In other words there is no direct predecessor on
                    which to rely. The target audience for DigHo is ideally the interested reader; a
                    primary readership is however academic readers. The considerations below on the
                    level of the commentary are especially focused on the historical commentaries
                    (section 7.1), since the verbal commentaries are in principle all encompassing
                    qua links to the digital <em>Ordbog over det danske Sprog</em> [Dictionary of
                    the Danish Language] (section 7.3).</p>
                <div>
                    <h2>7.1. Historical Commentaries</h2>
                    <h3>7.1.1. Comments and Indexes</h3>
                    <p>The scope of the historical commentaries is limited by the indexes that are
                        tied to persons, works, places and literary characters in <em>HS</em>, see
                        below, section 7.2. When it is considered necessary for the reader’s
                        understanding of the text, a supplementary commentary can be added to the
                        prosaic index entries at the appropriate place.</p>
                    <h3>7.1.2. Main Areas of the Historical Commentaries</h3>
                    <p>Besides the areas of knowledge covered by the indexes, the commentaries
                        illuminate – to the extent that it is deemed necessary for the understanding
                        of the text – matters including:</p>
                    <li>historical facts (events, phenomena, concepts etc.)</li>
                    <li>contemporary debates</li>
                    <li>references to mythological and biblical narratives</li>
                    <li>proverbs</li>
                    <li>references or connections to other Brandes texts (including correspondence) </li>
                    <li>clarification of critical textual problems, see above, sections 5.2.2 and
                        5.2.3</li>
                    <li>citations (primarily from literary texts, cf. 7.1.3)</li>
                    <li>Brandes’ sources (in collaboration with the overlapping commentaries in the
                        afterword, see section 7.1.4) </li>
                    <li>certain older words (which are not covered by <em>Ordbog over det danske
                            Sprog</em> [Dictionary of the Danish Language], or that have changed
                        meaning since the publication of the dictionary, see section 7.1.5)</li>
                    <h3>7.1.3. Citations</h3>
                    <p>Sources for Brandes’ employment of text written or spoken by others are
                        identified as broadly as possible, though with the flexibility in the
                        coverage of the commentaries that citations from handbooks, historical
                        accounts and the like are only documented to a modest extent.</p>
                    <p>Certain passages placed in quotation marks cannot be determined to contain
                        external text, but must rather be regarded as Brandes’ dramatized
                        paraphrases or exegeses. These are noted in a comment.</p>
                    <p>Citations are identified by the <em>original title</em> (though in cases of
                        variance, the universally accepted form is used, for example <em>Romeo and
                            Juliet</em> rather than <em>The Most Excellent and Lamentable Tragedy of
                            Romeo and Juliet</em>), <em>year of publication</em> of the first
                        edition, the <em>location</em> of the cited material (identification of the
                        chapter or book or act or scene or poem title), and the <em>page number</em>
                        in reliable modern edition (when possible) or in certain cases the first or
                        later edition (the edition is given in shortened form with a link to full

                                1787, 1:5).”</li>

                            <li>The following information appears when the shortened bibliographic
                                entry in parenthesis is clicked on or hovered over “Wilhelm Heinse:

                    </ul>
                    <p>For citations in the original language, Brandes’ later Danish translations in
                        SS is given in this form: “GB’s translation in <em>SS</em> [Collected
                        Writings] (vol. X, p. Y): …”. When the citation has been removed in
                        connection with a revision, no translation is given. </p>
                    <p>For citations in Danish, the cited work is identified, but the original
                        wording is not reproduced unless they disagree.</p>
                    <p>Textual problems in citations and translations are not noted in the critical
                        apparatus, but in the commentaries, see above, section 5.2.3. In general, it
                        should be noted that the essential aim of the commentary is at this point to
                        identify the sources, not to examine the usage of citations.</p>
                    <h3>7.1.4. Sources</h3>
                    <p>As far as possible – that is to the extent of the secondary literature and
                        the editors’ knowledge – Brandes’ scientific and literary sources and models
                        are identified. The central corpus of Brandes’ source material and his
                        “recycling technique” are touched on in the introductions to the individual
                        volumes of <em>HS</em>.</p>
                    <h3>7.1.5. Relation to Verbal Commentaries</h3>
                    <p>Words needed for the commentaries that do not appear in <em>Ordbog over det
                            danske Sprog</em> [Dictionary of the Danish Language] (or M<em>eyer’s
                            Fremmedordbog</em> [Foreign Words Dictionary], 1924), are explained.
                        Words that have changed meaning or whose double meaning has been lost are
                        marked to alert the reader. See section 7.3.</p>
                    <h3>7.1.6. Presentation of the Commentaries</h3>
                    <p>The commentaries are kept brief and concise. The frequency of the
                        commentaries is high in relation to analog editions, since phenomena that
                        demand repeated commentary – independent of the context – are only
                        unexplained when they appear on the same (book) page.</p>
                    <p>The following conventions are observed: </p>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
                        <li>Lemmas are given in basic form with conjugation endings in parenthesis,
                            for examples “Krigen(s)”</li>
                        <li>Lemmas are abridged by using three periods, for example “that time . . .
                            with”]</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For the conventions regarding the presentation of work, year, date etc., see
                        section 9.4 . </p>
                    <h3>7.1.7. Important Aids</h3>
                    <p>The commentaries make use of existing Brandes scholarship and philology.
                        Important aids in the production of the commentaries are the monographs on
                        young Brandes and his main work:</p>

                        standard dictionary of modern Danish, <em>Den Danske Ordbog</em>, DO.</p>
                    <p>The linguistic technological work has consisted in the initial development
                        (of a <em>full form list</em> based on ODS’s word descriptions, a <em>web
                            service</em> for 19<sup>th</sup> century Danish, which recognizes known
                        conjugated forms of words and the most common, systematic spelling
                        variations of the period, and which can manage searches in the dictionaries
                        in the inventory in the most expedient order, and which furthermore supports
                        manually chosen exceptions for automatic searches), and later
                        adjustments.</p>
                    <p>Next, the philological work consisted of: </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Establishing dictionary links to the words that are either not
                            automatically retrieved or where the automatic retrieval is not
                            expedient (for example, Brandes using spelling form 'Eiendom' for
                            'ejendom');</li>
                        <li>Identifying and marking “false friends” in Brandes’ texts, that is words
                            that have changed meaning since <em>ODS</em>, for example “patetisk” or
                            “lemfældig.” Also belonging to this category are words that have
                            multiple meanings, but where the meaning relevant to the text has been
                            lost, for example “naturalisme.” Such words are marked to make the
                            reader aware of the historical meaning</li>
                        <li>Supplying commentaries for instances in which the dictionaries are not
                            sufficient, because Brandes’ usage of a word is wholly outside the
                            inventory of the dictionaries, or its usage is not covered by the
                            explanations of meanings.</li>

                <div>
                    <h2>9.2. Content, Composition and Demarcation</h2>
                    <p>In general, the introductions pay special attention to HS as an international
                        project – sociologically, scientifically, aesthetically or ideologically –
                        by accounting for Brandes’ strategies for internationalization, comparative
                        methodology, European scope, world literary point of view, his international
                        inheritance and debts or similar.</p>
                    <p>The afterwords are uniformly constructed (aside from the general one on the
                        textual history of <em>HS</em>). The main sections, which are disposed and
                        filled out in various manners, and whose relative scope necessarily changes
                        from text to text, are as follows:</p>

                    <h3>9.2.1. Introduction</h3>
                    <p>The introductions are capsule texts that point out the central problematics
                        of the following sections and the context(s) in which Brandes’ text should
                        be read.</p>
                    <h3>9.2.2. Background and Genesis</h3>
                    <p>This section on the background of the work and its genesis involves an
                        account of Brandes’ situation and other activities around the time he held
                        the lectures and the publication of the relevant volumes of HS. But other
                        types of general background and concrete circumstances can also be included,
                        of, for example intellectual, cultural and literary historical nature.</p>
                    <h3>9.2.3. Free Section</h3>
                    <p>After a brief sketch of the content, the author has been free to decide how
                        the work shall be analyzed and interpreted, since the research project’s
                        general situating of HS as an international phenomenon is woven into the
                        context.</p>
                    <h3>9.2.4. Reception and Afterlife</h3>
                    <p>This section documents and illustrates the positions taken in the
                        contemporary reception of Brandes’ work as well as the later reception – or
                        the history of its impact in Denmark and abroad.</p>
                    <h3>9.2.5. Bibliography</h3>
                    <p>The editors provide individual accounts of the manuscripts and printings of

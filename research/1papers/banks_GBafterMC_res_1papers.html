                <h3>Brandes After <em>Main Currents</em>: Political Journalism. Human Rights
                    Advocacy</h3>
                <p>by <span class="author">William Banks</span></p>
                <p> As is evidenced in the new introductions to the six volumes of Main Currents --
                    as well as in the books themselves -- Brandes gradually drifted away from the
                    sharply ideological and politically focused literary criticism of the early
                    volumes toward a rising preoccupation with the individual "great personalities"
                    of European literary history, among them, of course, Goethe and Heine. In some
                    sense it is thus fair to say that Main Currents became somewhat less politically
                    charged as the nearly two decades long project unfolded. Yet it would be a
                    mistake to presume from this that Brandes after the completion of his master
                    work somehow abandoned political engagement. Indeed, from the mid 1890s until
                    the end of his life, the very opposite is the case. This essay briefly
                    summarizes Brandes' activity as international human rights advocate in the final
                    three decades of his long life in letters.</p>
                <p>The essay draws upon the author's forthcoming volume, <em>Georg Brandes. Human Rights and Oppressed
                    Peoples. Collected Essays and Speeches</em>, which will be published by the
                    University of Wisconsin Press in the spring of 2020.</p>

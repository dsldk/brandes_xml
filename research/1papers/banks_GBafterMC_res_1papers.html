                <h3>Brandes After <em>Main Currents</em>: Political Journalism. Human Rights
                    Advocacy</h3>
                <p>by <span class="author">William Banks</span></p>
                <p> As is evidenced in the new introductions to the six volumes of Main Currents --
                    as well as in the books themselves -- Brandes gradually drifted away from the
                    sharply ideological and politically focused literary criticism of the early
                    volumes toward a rising preoccupation with the individual "great personalities"
                    of European literary history, among them, of course, Goethe and Heine. In some
                    sense it is thus fair to say that Main Currents became somewhat less politically
                    charged as the nearly two decades long project unfolded. Yet it would be a
                    mistake to presume from this that Brandes after the completion of his master
                    work somehow abandoned political engagement. Indeed, from the mid 1890s until
                    the end of his life, the very opposite is the case. This essay briefly
                    summarizes Brandes' activity as international human rights advocate in the final
                    three decades of his long life in letters.</p>
                <p>The essay draws upon the author's forthcoming volume, <em>Georg Brandes. Human
                        Rights and Oppressed Peoples. Collected Essays and Speeches</em>, which will
                    be published by the University of Wisconsin Press in the spring of 2020.</p>

                <h1 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
                <p> The completion of the immense enterprise that has been the <em>Digital
                        Currents</em> project will surely go a long way toward generating new and
                    deserved interest in the figure of Georg Brandes, he who for a half century was
                    placed at the very center of the world republic of letters and yet, for a number
                    of reasons, no longer occupies such a position within world literary historical
                    memory. The project has performed a critical service to the human sciences in
                    making <em>Main Currents</em>, that single work upon which his formidable
                    reputation had been built, widely accessible to a new generation of readers.
                    Given the extent of the impact of <em>Main Currents</em>, both at home in
                    Norden, in Europe and eventually the much larger world, Brandes could, after he
                    delivered the manuscript for the sixth and final volume in 1890, opted for an
                    early retirement. Indeed, he could have done so relatively certain that his
                    place in world literary history had been firmly secured. In the disciplinary
                    (and international) domain, the work had done a great deal toward establishing
                    comparative literature as an independent and autonomous branch of literary
                    studies. Perhaps even more importantly, within the local Danish (and
                    Scandinavian) context, <em>Main Currents</em> had by all means fulfilled its
                    equally significant aim of provoking literary (and, more broadly, cultural)
                    change in relatively backward Norden. The critic’s famous call, in the famous
                    inaugural lecture of November 3rd, 1871, for a new literature that “provokes
                    debate” was very soon answered by the young writers of Scandinavia, so much so
                    that only a dozen years later, Brandes could declare unconditional victory,
                    issuing a celebratory volume of portraits of the leading lights of the movement
                    he had deemed the Modern Breakthrough (<em>Det Moderne Gjennembruds Mænd</em>
                    1883). Not only had Brandes and his many allies emancipated Scandinavia from its
                    “long Romantic hangover,” they had transformed Norden from a literary
                    afterthought to a vital center within the world literary republic, effectively
                    crashing the party so long the exclusive affair of France, of Germany, of
                    England, a rare moment in the sun for such a peripheral part of the globe that
                    would not be relinquished until the First World War. </p>

                <p> Given how restless and searching as was the spirit of Brandes, the critic could
                    hardly rest on the considerable laurels he had already acquired before reaching
                    the age of fifty. His productivity after <em>Main Currents</em>, accordingly,
                    shows no sign of abatement, right up until his death in 1927. The nature of this
                    production, however, most certainly does change, and indeed had already begun to
                    do so during the nearly two decades during which he labored on his master work.
                    This essay provides a brief, although by no means comprehensive, overview of the
                    critic’s work after <em>Main Currents</em>. All emphasis is placed on what is
                    wholly new in mature Brandes, specifically his sustained activity as political
                    journalist, his tireless advocacy on behalf of all those to whom he referred as
                        <em>undertrykte folkeslag</em>, those oppressed peoples, beginning with his
                    fellow Danes in Sønderjylland but eventually encompassing the manifold of
                    national minority populations of Eurasia as well as, gradually, the colonized
                    peoples of Europe’s oversea imperia</p>

                <h1 id="radicalisms">2. Two Brandesian Radicalisms: Literary and Aristocratic</h1>


                <p>It is customary to divide the long career of the critic into two distinct phases,
                    namely the early period of his specifically <em>literary</em> radicalism, which
                    loosely corresponds to his work on Main Currents (1870-1880s), and the later
                    period of his <em>aristocratic</em> radicalism, roughly stretching from the late
                    1880s until his death. This division is of great usefulness in acquiring an
                    understanding of the long-term evolution of the critic’s thinking, although two
                    important observations are in order. In the first place, contemporary readers of
                    Brandes must be wary of overestimating the extent of the rupture that took place
                    in the 1880s; the critic’s thinking and praxis did indeed change dramatically at
                    this time, yet there is far more continuity between the “literary” and
                    “aristocratic” iterations of his radicalism than it would appear. In the second
                    place, it must be kept in mind that while the general intellectual orientation
                    of each of his two phases was characterized by a considerable degree of
                    instability, the young Brandes was by and large a significantly more
                        <em>coherent</em> figure than the mature critic, that is to say that the
                    cracks and the fissures of literary radicalism were less severe than those its
                    aristocratic variant. </p>
                <p>Young Brandes, that is the Brandes of literary radicalism, was in particular
                    blessed with a relatively happy harmony between political and purely artistic
                    concerns within his overall aesthetics. As so forthrightly asserted in the
                    November lecture, the critic had pressed young Nordic authors to reject their
                    preoccupation with an imagined and idealized past in favor of an immersion in
                    the present and in reality. More importantly, at the same time he enjoined them
                    to seek to transform that stagnant and reactionary reality into something
                    modern, progressive, freethinking, just as the poets and thinkers of Europe’s
                    major countries, beginning with Byron, had done fully forty years prior.
                    Literary radicalism, critically, thus understands politics and political
                    engagement to be a constituent element of modern literature, not exactly on an
                    equal footing with purely formal considerations, but very much a sine qua non.
                    As Julie Allen has recently emphasized, the critic would later, in the foreword
                    to the second German edition of <em>Main Currents</em> (1897), written after his
                    views had changed fundamentally, note that “the original orientation of the work
                    is political, not literary” (cited in Allen 2012:63). A quarter century later,
                    as stressed by Brandes biographer Jørgen Knudsen, the critic would reaffirm this
                    view of <em>Main Currents</em> in the preface to the sixth Danish edition
                    (Knudsen 2004:424).</p>
                <p>Brandesian literary radicalism as manifested in <em>Main Currents</em> was also,
                    critically, deeply indebted to the dialectical Hegelian (and post-Hegelian)
                    tradition in which the young critic had been educated. As carefully outlined by
                    Anders Engberg-Pedersen in his article for this project (see especially section
                    3, <a
                        href="https://georgbrandes.dk/research/2introductions/engberg_hs3_1874_res_2introductions_en.html#methodology"
                        target="_blank"> “The Reaction in France”</a>), the dramatic structure of
                    the work was staged as a dialectical interplay of a series of oppositions,
                    Voltaire’s kingdom of reason and Rousseau’s kingdom of feeling, the principle of
                    freedom and brotherhood as manifested in 1789 and the authority principle that
                    followed in its wake, the spirit of the freethinking of the 18th century and the
                    stifling descent into reaction of the early 19th. In Brandes’ peculiar
                    appropriation of Hegel, critically, the poetic works (and the personalities that
                    composed them) were viewed principally as (mere) expressions of the underlying
                    intellectual and affective <em>currents</em> of the age. Brandes effectively
                    attempts to look through the work and the personality for the more significant
                    ideological underpinnings, the Idea at the expense of individual genius.</p>

                <p> By the end of the 1880s, the literary radical theoretical foundation of <em>Main
                        Currents</em>, never entirely secure in the first place, began to unravel,
                    especially with respect to its Hegelian component. As Per Dahl has illuminated
                    (see section 4c in his essay for this project, <a
                        href="https://georgbrandes.dk/research/1papers/dahl_mc_textualhistory_res_1papers_en.html#method"
                        target="_blank"> “The Textual History of <em>Main Currents</em>”</a>),
                    Brandes provided us with a clear point of departure for his evolving thought,
                    expressed in an important open letter of 1887, in which he confesses that in the
                    early stages of the project he was “still metaphysically minded,” i.e. Hegelian,
                    and that he had “overlooked the personalities; they were only the organs of the
                    Ideas” (Brandes 1887). During the long period of work on <em>Main Currents</em>,
                    the critic thus gradually became increasingly preoccupied with the personalities
                    of the poets and thinkers themselves, at the expense of the Ideas they
                    expressed; in a different sense this further corresponds to a movement away from
                    the sociology of Taine to the psychology of Sainte-Beuve. The consequences of
                    this shift in understanding were immense, for now the significance of the
                    individual talent was seen to be located within the constitution of the
                    personality itself, rather than somewhere outside of it. As Dahl has
                    demonstrated (see section 4d), there were already strong hints of this in the
                    portrait of Byron, which so thoroughly dominates <em>Naturalism in England</em>
                    (1875). By the late 1880s, the internal conflict within Brandes had clearly been
                    resolved, as from this point forward in his literary work, the critic becomes
                    increasingly preoccupied with the great personalities of world history at the
                    expense of Hegelian Absolute Spirit; as Adam Paulsen notes (see section III.B of
                    his essay for this project, <a
                        href="https://georgbrandes.dk/research/2introductions/paulsen_hs6_1890_res_2introductions_en.html#themes"
                        target="_blank"> “Young Germany”</a>), mature Brandes practiced “an
                    experiential and biographical aesthetics, according to which art was conceived
                    as ‘the expression of mental perturbations’ with ‘the aim of calling forth
                    mental perturbations.’” </p>
                <p>This general reordering of the critic’s views marks the point of transition from
                    the early literary radicalism of his first phase to the specifically
                    aristocratic radicalism of his mature period. Critical to this process of
                    self-reinvention was Brandes’ fateful late 1880s encounter with a then still
                    obscure Friedrich Nietzsche; indeed, the name of the critic’s second phase is
                    taken from the title of his seminal portrait of the philosopher of Basel,
                    “Aristocratic Radicalism” (<em>Tilskueren</em> August 1889), which was based on
                    a series of lectures delivered earlier that year in Copenhagen, lectures which
                    would soon come to rival the address of November 1871 with respect to their
                    impact on Nordic (as well as German) literature. From Nietzsche Brandes acquired
                    a new appreciation of what he would come to call <em>det store Menneske</em>
                    [the great man]: </p>
                <blockquote>This person willingly takes upon himself the sufferings of speaking the
                    truth. His foundational insight is that a happy life is impossible; the highest
                    a human being can reach is a heroic life, one in which he struggles against the
                    greatest dangers for something that in one or another matter will benefit
                    everyone. Only those authentic humans among us can rise up to the truly human,
                    those who seem destined to be a leap in nature, thinkers and mentors, artists
                    and creators, and those who make an impact more through their being than through
                    their works: the nobility, those whose goodness is grand, those in whom the
                    genius of the good manifests itself. (Brandes 1889:574)</blockquote>
                <p>Still the provocateur, Brandes proceeds to claim that such great personalities
                    constitute no less than “the purpose of history,” and that the role of us
                    ordinary souls is thus limited to “the task of working, both inside ourselves
                    and without, for the bringing forth of the thinker and the artist, the lover of
                    the truth and of beauty, the pure and good personality” (Brandes 1889:574,575).
                    As Paulsen has noted (see the sections IIIb and IIIc), the critic’s new approach
                    was already fully on display, in the expansive portraits of Goethe and Heine, in
                    the sixth and final volume of <em>Main Currents</em>; for the remainder of his
                    career as literary critic, Brandes would largely devote himself to a long series
                    of monographs on the “great individuals of world history,” among them
                    Shakespeare (1895-1896), Ibsen (1898), Goethe (1915), Voltaire (1916-1917),
                    Napoleon (1917), Julius Caesar (1918), Michelangelo (1921). </p>

                    provoke, and once more Brandes would not need to wait long for the inevitable
                    fallout. Just a few months later, the Danish philosophy professor Harald
                    Høffding, the very representative of the intellectual establishment that had
                    found no use for Brandes, responded with a vigorous critique, “Democratic
                    Radicalism. An Objection,” which appeared in the November/December number of
                        <em>Tilskueren</em>. The ensuing debate, which reached ever greater
                    magnitudes of intensity, would continue into the following spring, with each
                    combatant weighing in twice more. </p>
                <p>The feud between Brandes and Høffding is of significance here for the light it
                    sheds on the critic’s transition toward his mature position of specifically
                    aristocratic radicalism. The break with Hegel was a long time coming, but when
                    it arrived it was in every way decisive. The equally important question, that of
                    whether Brandes’ apparent affirmation of a new (intellectual and artistic,
                    rather than hereditary) form of aristocracy also amounts to a rejection of the
                    other component of literary radicalism, namely its insistence that if art is to
                    be modern, and after Brandes in the Germanic world all ought <em>should</em> be
                    modern, it must be politically engaged. More clearly formulated, did the
                    critic’s movement from literary to aristocratic radicalism amount to a
                        <em>retreat</em> from politics? In brief, the answer is most certainly no,
                    yet much in the critic’s production during his mature period would seem to
                    suggest otherwise.</p>

                <p>In surveying the literary monography of his aristocratic phase, it must certainly
                    seem that the old harmony between progressive political engagement and purely
                    artistic concerns has largely been abandoned. Indeed, the list of “world
                    historical personalities” the critic chose to profile is conspicuous in that
                    only Voltaire and Ibsen may be counted among those who consciously aligned
                    themselves with the Enlightenment values so cherished by young Brandes; and
                    Ibsen, rather notoriously, was famously uncomfortable with such a designation.
                    Two of Brandes “culture heroes,” moreover, were arguably on the other side of
                    history, Caesar and Napoleon having effectively ending their respective
                    traditions of republican rule.</p>

                <p>Even more so, Brandes’ reckless sallies against Høffding reveal a disturbing
                    tendency toward contempt for “the mob” and even for the idea of democracy
                    itself. Over and over again, the critic evinces the form of contempt for the
                    masses so familiar to us from Nietzsche, a contempt also, it must be remembered,
                    present in the thinking of another of Brandes’ interlocutors, the consummate
                    liberal J.S. Mill. Freethinking and progress, it seems, have far more to fear
                    from the deprivations of the organized mob than from the actions of the “great
                    men” appointed by history to lead humanity toward a brighter future:</p>

                <blockquote>When the passions of the masses come into motion, the rational majority,
                    even more the rational individual, will be overruled, shoved to the side, or
                    crushed. The masses are not 1 + 1 + 1 (up to the number they come to), but 1 + 1
                    + 1 [...] + X, that is the beastliness that is developed within the individual
                    when he becomes the masses. [...] When Proff. Høffding, in a contradiction more
                    apparent than real, thereby asserts the necessity of releasing steadily more of
                    the masses to a free, humane life, this necessity is a testimony of precisely
                    the meager human worth of the masses as masses, and of the danger the masses
                    pose as opponents of the great men. This danger naturally also determines the
                    usefulness of the masses as power in the hands of the great man, as a means of
                    accomplishing his plans, which namely include the plans for the advancement of
                    the masses. (Brandes 1890:19-20). </blockquote>
                <p>In parrying these attacks, Høffding comes off as by far the more sober – and
                    humane – figure, effectively outflanking his opponent. Employing the nascent
                    logic of social democracy to the domain of culture, Høffding asserts that the
                    measure of the cultural development of a people is to be found in the mean,
                    rather than at the top, and that single individuals of greatness, which he
                    readily concedes are a necessity for a well-functioning human society, are to be
                    evaluated according to the good they produce for society, as a means rather than
                    an end in themselves. Perhaps most effectively, he offers up the eminently
                    reasonable observation that the more ordinary people are educated and
                    cultivated, the more likely they are to be capable of appreciating the great
                    individual.</p>

                <h1 id="thoughts">4. “Thoughts at the Turn of the Century”</h1>
                <p>Much in the seemingly illiberal and anti-democratic stance adopted by Brandes in
                    his polemics against Høffding would appear to suggest that the critic had
                    largely turned his back on politics, and yet, as has been noted, this is
                    precisely not the case; indeed, the critic would, beginning around the middle of
                    the 1890s, dramatically <em>intensify</em> his involvement in affairs of state.
                    However counterintuitive it might appear, there is in fact ample room for
                    political activity within the mature, aristocratic iteration of Brandesian
                    radicalism, although the nature of the critic’s political engagement, as
                    indicated, has changed in quality as well as in quantity. Whereas Brandes the
                    literary radical had largely embedded his politics <em>within</em> his literary
                    criticism and history – a fitting descriptor for the methodology of <em>Main
                        Currents</em> is what the Danes would later come to call
                        <em>ideologikritik</em> – the mature critic effectively sections off his
                    politics from the relatively (but hardly entirely) apolitical literary
                    monography. That the critic is conscious of the bifurcated nature of his mature
                    production is acknowledged in his 1905 essay “Zionism,” written around the time
                    that his first period of sustained activities as political journalist was coming
                    to an end; here Brandes laments that such labors “have consumed three months of
                    my working life this year” (Brandes 1910:407).</p>
                <p>What motivates the critic to make this fateful leap, from relatively abstract
                    ideological critique to direct intervention in the form of political journalism,
                    was a dramatically revised – and much more pessimistic – understanding of
                    political development within Europe’s core countries. As clearly evident in the
                    November 1871 lecture, the young Brandes held up France, Germany and England as
                    exemplars of progress and freethinking, as models worthy of study and emulation
                    by backward Denmark. In the 1870s, the essential task for young Danes was
                    working toward to the closure of the “forty-year gap” separating Denmark from
                    Europe. By the 1890s, however, a series of disturbing developments in the major
                    countries had compelled the critic to rethink his youthful valorization of them.
                    The critic would outline his new views in a seminal 1899 address to the Danish
                    Student Union, the association of freethinking young Danes that had long served
                    as a forum for his evolving thinking. “Thoughts at the Turn of the Century,”
                    published in the January 1900 edition of <em>Tilskueren</em>, begins with an
                    acknowledgement that as young man he had overlooked two troubling developments
                    within the core countries of Europe. In the first place the critic had failed to
                    appreciate the significance of the outbreak of the Paris Commune in March of
                    1871, which is now understood as “the event that has most determined European
                    politics” ever since, in that “fear of its repetition led the bourgeoisie of all
                    the main countries” to forsake the very “freethinking” that had been the source
                    of all their progress; the “social question” raised by events in Paris would
                    come to “occupy all of the minds of the political class at the turn of the
                    century,” and “the social revolution” was seen as imminent (Brandes 1902a:143).
                    In the second place Brandes had failed to appreciate the intensity of French
                    revanchist rage at the loss of Alsace and Lorraine, and because “both Germany
                    and France had entered in to powerful systems of alliances, the outbreak of a
                    world war remained continuously plausible” (Brandes 1902a:143). That neither of
                    these grim possibilities had realized themselves by the end of the century was
                    hardly, the critic warned, cause for celebration:</p>
                <blockquote>Although the world war and the social revolution have not come to pass,
                    it is evident that they have only been postponed. But the decisive political
                    event we have experienced at the end of the 19th century is this: the great
                    powers divide the world among themselves. They try to do this as peacefully as
                    possible, in that they attempt to avoid a world war. Yet still they act with an
                    injurious recklessness, because for the sake of economic advantage they
                    sacrifice not only those peoples whom they conquer by fire and sword, but
                    further all the small nations within their immediate orbit, which are either
                    absorbed for the sake of national unity or exchanged as bounty or delivered up
                    to brutality, all in order that the peace be preserved. (Brandes
                    1902a:144-145).</blockquote>
                <p>If the young Brandes had largely conceived of Europe as divided into freethinking
                    and reactionary blocs, the latter in desperate need of following the lead of the
                    former, the mature Brandes perceived the world very differently, as a wholly
                    unequal contest between predator nation and prey, between the major powers and
                    everyone else. </p>
                <p>The advent of Neocolonialism, by papering over social tensions at home and by
                    transferring great power rivalries to far flung reaches of the globe, had indeed
                    served to forestall catastrophe, yet this perilously flimsy peace had of course
                    been purchased at the expense of the newly colonized as well as the small
                    nations of the European periphery:</p>
                <blockquote>In the new century there will be a new distinction between the states of
                    Europe. The old division into great powers and powers of the second rank will be
                    dissolved by that between the European (and perhaps Asiatic) world powers
                    (Japan) and the merely local states of Europe, which will have lost all their
                    political influence and any hope of expansion or growth. The smaller they are,
                    the more miserable their political prospects seem. (Brandes 1902a:145) </blockquote>
                <p>It is evident from this that Brandes at the turn of the century does seem to
                    privilege the unhappy fate of Europe’s lesser countries; the far greater
                    suffering of the newly subjugated peoples of Africa and Asia – those whom the
                    major powers “conquer by fire and sword” – is noted here only as prelude to the
                    larger point about the European periphery. This preoccupation can to a large
                    extent be explained with reference to the critic’s gradually evolving conception
                    of oppressed peoples. As has been noted, the critic begins his rights advocacy
                    in the mid 1890s in the <em>national</em> sphere, as a response to the
                    ascendancy of Ernst Matthias von Köller (1841-1928), who after his appointment
                    as <em>Oberpräsident</em> of Schleswig-Holstein began to introduce increasingly
                    harsh Germanization measures against the 300,000 ethnic Danes under the rule of
                    the German Reich. Yet the seemingly national “we” employed in “Thoughts at the
                    Turn of the Century” is actually something much larger, for by the expansive
                    logic of solidarism, Brandes would in the coming quarter century continuously
                    extend his advocacy work outward, first largely (but not entirely) toward
                    similar subject populations of Eurasia and later toward the colonized abroad. </p>
                <p>“Thoughts at the Turn of the Century” functions as a kind of annunciation of the
                    critic’s coming foray into international rights advocacy, which would kick off
                    the following summer with the appearance in <em>Politiken</em> of his critique
                    of Kaiser Wilhelm’s infamous “Hunnenrede,” delivered on the occasion of the
                    embarkation of German forces for the punitive campaign against the Boxer rebels
                    of China. That the critic’s long stint as international tribune of oppressed
                    peoples begins with a defense of non-European people is of immense significance
                    in that it demonstrates the essential universality of his conception of the
                    rights of peoples, yet his initial burst of activity, as has been noted, is
                    otherwise concerned almost exclusively with the subject populations of Eurasia,
                    most prominently the partitioned Poles and the embattled Armenian community of
                    the Ottoman Empire. It is really not until 1922, when Brandes delivered his
                    monumental Christiania address on “Imperialism,” that the critic fully
                    articulates a critique of the domination of the weak by the strong that is truly
                    planetary in its scope.</p>
                <p>The 1899 address is also, finally, of interest in that it so clearly demonstrates
                    how the mature critic’s essentially aristocratic orientation can relatively
                    comfortably coexist with continued political engagement, specifically in defense
                    of the weaker against the stronger. The first two thirds of the speech, as
                    described, amount to a vigorous defense of the rights of the weaker peoples of
                    the globe; if anything “Thoughts at the Turn of Century” demonstrates that
                    Brandes in no manner or form attempts to apply the Nietzschean critique of
                    “slave morality” to the contest of nations. If in the domain of national culture
                    ordinary people are called upon to follow the lead of the great individuals in
                    their midst, the same does not at all apply to relations between “major” and
                    “minor” countries; indeed, the “lesser” peoples of the globe are continuously
                    enjoined to resist the predations of the “greater” powers. The essential
                    incongruity of mature Brandes’ intellectual orientation is fully on display
                    here, for the final third of the speech consists of a long inventory of the
                    individual “great men” the critic has come to know during his travels across the
                    continent, hovering over them all, of course, Nietzsche himself. For the mature
                    Brandes, up to the end, “human greatness remains the goal [...] the measure of
                    all things” (Brandes 1902a:156).</p>

                <h1 id="nationalsentiment">5. Continuity in the Evolution of the Critic: National
                    sentiment</h1>

                <p>It should now be evident that Brandes’ general theoretical orientation changed
                    significantly over time, and we have every reason to uphold the consensus
                    division of his long career into early literary and mature aristocratic phases.
                    Yet two essential aspects of the critic’s intellectual and spiritual core
                    largely survived this transition, features of his thinking and praxis that serve
                    to explain – in part, but not entirely – the seeming contradiction at the very
                    center of his mature position. The first is a profound (but by no means
                    unconditional) love of country, the second, which is evidenced by the names
                    ascribed to his two distinct phases, is the critic’s radicalism. Each of these
                    facets deserves special attention.</p>
                <p>The famous appellation bestowed on Brandes by Nietzsche, that of “the good
                    European and cultural mediator,” was by all means deserved, and yet we must be
                    wary of making too much of it, of conceiving of the critic as a kind of rootless
                    cosmopolitan. Despite his Jewish ancestry, Brandes was in all almost every
                    important sense a thoroughly Danish figure, a self-understanding with which he
                    was wholly comfortable, and he was a fervent patriot at that. As comprehensive
                    and as damning as is the critique of Danish culture presented in the November
                    1871 lecture, Brandes in no manner or form endorses the rather obvious solution
                    taken up by so many similarly placed ambitious young intellectuals, namely
                    self-imposed exile in one of the European cultural metropoles. His one extended
                    period of exile, the Berlin sojourn of 1877-1883, was the result of financial
                    necessity, and at no point during this period did he ever seek to cut off
                    contact with home. Denmark is to be transformed, it is not to be abandoned.</p>
                <p>His fellow Danes, of course, consistently accused him of disloyalty to his
                    homeland, as evidenced in a 1905 commentary by the American critic Albert Shaw,
                    who reports that Brandes is viewed by his countrymen as “a traitor, a
                    cosmopolite, an enemy of the nation.” (Shaw 1905:107). The critic’s foray into
                    international rights advocacy after the turn of the century, his ever wider
                    ranging engagement with the manifold of oppressed peoples across the globe, only
                    served to strengthen these accusations that had plagued him from the very
                    beginning, as Brandes was seen by Danes as neglecting issues much closer to
                    home. The same, sadly enough, is also true of the critic’s relationship to the
                    other half of his identity, as European Jewry, especially proponents of Zionism
                    (which Brandes largely opposed) regularly accused him of neglect. Nowhere is
                    this tension more apparent than in his work on behalf of the Poles, that single
                    people whom he loved most dearly and on behalf of whom he expended the most
                    energy. For fear of damaging the cause of Polish independence he had made his
                    own, Brandes remained almost totally silent on the matter of Polish
                    anti-Semitism; indeed, his regular appearances in partitioned Poland were
                    occasionally boycotted by local Jewish communities. It would not be until the
                    outbreak of the war, when undeniable reports of Polish led pogroms began to
                    appear in the press, that the critic would finally speak out against his beloved
                    Poles.</p>
                <p>In spite of the efforts of his many enemies to paint him as a traitor, Brandes
                    was, as has been suggested, deeply committed to the cause of his people. As Sune
                    Berthelsen and Ditte Marie Egebjerg have carefully demonstrated, the critic was
                    no rudderless cosmopolite; instead, his understanding of national identity is
                    more properly qualified by what they call “national cosmopolitanism,” a form of
                    love of country that by no means excludes an openness and a generosity toward
                    the larger world, a kind of precursor to what Kwame Anthony Appiah has termed
                    “rooted cosmopolitanism” (Berthelsen and Egebjerg 2004:99). As a radical thinker
                    the critic is of course categorically opposed to the kind of belligerent
                    nationalism characteristic of the major powers (and, it should be remembered,
                    all too many small nations as well), what Thomas Nordby has aptly defined as “a
                    nation’s aggressive self-assertion at the expense of other peoples and races”
                    (Nordby 1973:142). Rejecting such <em>nationalisme</em>, Brandes instead
                    endorses a love of country determined by what he calls <em>nationalfølelse</em>.
                    This <em>national sentiment</em> is primary, yet wholly compatible with
                    cosmopolitan generosity; indeed, the two sensibilities mutually reinforce one
                    another:</p>
                <blockquote>A sense of world citizenship built upon a foundation of national
                    sentiment is not only quite possible, it is indeed unnatural without such a
                    basis. Just as conceiving of oneself as a Scandinavian does not in any manner
                    preclude conceiving oneself first and foremost as a Dane, so it is unnatural to
                    conceive of oneself as a Northerner without first identifying oneself according
                    to one’s particular Nordic nationality — the same holds true with conceiving
                    oneself as a European or a citizen of the world. First we are Danes! That is a
                    matter of course. (Brandes 1902b:199)</blockquote>
                <p>Brandes delivered these remarks in another address before the Danish Student
                    Union, “On National Sentiment,” in 1894, thirty years after catastrophic
                    national defeat in the Dano-Prussian War, which had resulted not only in the
                    loss of a large portion of the old homeland, but also, as the critic painfully
                    articulates, Denmark’s very sense of self-confidence and national destiny. The
                    Brandesian concept of national sentiment is thus framed much less in the sense
                    of a right than of a duty, a duty especially to the long-suffering Danish
                    minority of Sønderjylland:</p>
                <blockquote>And that effort, which has also been taken up by the Student Union, to
                    establish connections between North Schleswig and the Kingdom in order to
                    preserve the linguistic and cultural spheres of Denmark, is for us Danes a
                    cultural task of the highest order. We have a national duty to protect our
                    language and to resist the loss of even an inch of that territory. The Germans
                    themselves would look on us with contempt if we failed our <em>duty</em> in this
                    respect. (Brandes 1902b:200)</blockquote>
                <p>The nationalist typically seeks to flatter the national audience at every turn,
                    to indulge each of its vanities, to insist that it is the rest of the world that
                    must bow to the needs and the desires of the nation. National sentiment, in
                    absolute contrast, places demands on the national community, it urges the
                    citizen to seek continuously to close the gulf between lived reality and
                    national ideality, and even more so, to constantly re-evaluate and revalue those
                    ideals. As stirring as this call is in the 1894 address, the speech in no manner
                    or form underestimates the challenges facing Denmark. Commenting on the meager
                    reception of the Danish contribution to the 1878 Exposition Universelle, the
                    critic reports with alarm that one single sentence was on the lips of the
                    Parisian attendees: “le Danemark s’efface” (Brandes 1902b:191). It is thus
                    incumbent upon every Dane, especially young writers, to resist what seemed at
                    the time to be a perilous slide into national extinction. Brandes himself would
                    take the lead in this most essential national project, not only continuing his
                    efforts to promote Danish literature abroad, but even more so issuing a steady
                    stream of essays and stumping tirelessly on behalf of his embattled countrymen
                    and women, all the way up until the matter was largely resolved after the Great
                    War. His major writings on the Sønderjylland Question were in fact republished
                    in the volume <em>Southern Jutland Under Prussian Pressure</em>, issued the year
                    before the 1920 plebiscite that resulted in the return of much of the old North
                    Schleswig territory to the kingdom.</p>
                <p>The critic’s activities during the 1890s effectively served as dry run for his
                    later, internationally-oriented rights advocacy after the turn of the century,
                    as a kind of national dress rehearsal for his eventual entry onto the world
                    stage. And yet his commitment to Denmark and Danishness is of further
                    significance here in that it demonstrates that the critic’s foray into
                    international affairs of state remained throughout possessed of an equally
                    important national component. That Brandes was sincerely dedicated to the cause
                    of the Poles, the Armenians, the Finns, the Persians – all of the many oppressed
                    peoples for whom he advocated – is beyond any measure of doubt. We need only
                    look at how much his activism cost him; all the affection showered upon him by
                    those whose cause he made his own was most certainly offset by the hostility it
                    engendered in the major countries. This is most evident during the critic’s
                    second phase of sustained activity, his principled and uncompromising opposition
                    to the aims and the conduct of the belligerent powers in the Great War. From
                    October of 1914 through the “resolution” of the conflict in the Versailles
                    Treaty, Brandes consistently critiqued the allegedly high-minded ideals fueling
                    the war from all sides. His impassioned defense of Danish neutrality, first
                    against the repeated assaults of his longtime friend and ally, French premier
                    Georges Clemenceau, and then against similar attacks from the Scottish
                    translator and Scandinavianist William Archer, earned him the opprobrium of an
                    entire generation of French and Englishmen; indeed, it is arguably the immense
                    damage done to his international reputation by his wartime stance that has more
                    than any other factor contributed to his diminishment in world literary memory. </p>
                <p>Despite the intensity of his commitment to the various oppressed peoples of the
                    globe, Brandes’ activity as international tribune was, as suggested, underpinned
                    by a powerful national aspect, just as was the case with <em>Main Currents</em>.
                    As Allen has demonstrated, the critic “believed that having the courage to
                    protest injustice [in the larger world outside Denmark], even at great personal
                    cost, was central to a grounded, enlightened Danish national identity as the
                    development of the innovative literary culture to which his name had become so
                    inextricably linked” (Allen 2012:91). His sincere hope is that enterprise of
                    national cultural modernization he had set in motion in the Modern Breakthrough
                    might grow into an equally progressive and humane international orientation
                    within his native land. Brandes seems to have believed, somewhat idealistically,
                    that the particular historical experience of the Danes, the long period of
                    national decline and descent into abject powerlessness on the world stage
                    following the defeat of 1864, ought naturally to inspire in its citizenry an
                    inherent sympathy for all the similarly put upon nations of the globe. He would
                    render this national ideal imaginary in the powerful “Address on Møn” in 1904,
                    asserting that a genuine, modern form of love of country is far more than the
                    praise of its people, the glorification of its past and present
                    accomplishments:</p>
                <blockquote>It is also more important to develop a sense of freedom and justice
                    among the people, not just for its own use . . . Thus it was my ideal that it
                    should be known that, despite the small size of our country, men lived here who
                    felt sympathy for with all wronged individuals or oppressed peoples across the
                    world and who lifted their voices, spoke on their behalf. (<em>Samlede
                        Skrifter</em> XV:443, translation by Allen 2012:101). </blockquote>
                <p>Denmark, Brandes dreams, ought to come to be viewed as a kind of beacon of humane
                    and just values, in natural sympathy and solidarity with all the oppressed
                    peoples of the globe. That the Danes have historically failed to live up to this
                    rather impossible standard is a matter of course. Indeed, and this would
                    certainly be a source of immense sadness for the critic, Norway and Sweden,
                    those “humanitarian superpowers” and “regimes of the good,” have most certainly
                    come closer; for evidence of this we need only look to the dreadful images of a
                    few years ago, when Danish state officials shamelessly harassed Syrian refugees
                    simply transiting the country en route to safe harbor in Sweden. Yet the
                    essentially Nordic idea that the national community might serve as beacon of
                    hope for the world arguably begins here, in Brandes.</p>

                <h1 id="radicalism">6. Continuity in the Evolution of the Critic: Radicalism</h1>

                <p>In addition to his rather curious form of love of country, Brandes remained, as
                    has been noted, a fundamentally <em>radical</em> thinker throughout his long
                    career. It must be stressed here that the noun <em>radikalisme</em> and the
                    adjective <em>radikal</em> are possessed of a historical trajectory
                    fundamentally distinct from the Anglophone world. As such, a substantial
                    philological interlude is in order here.</p>
                <p>The adjective “radical” first emerged in English in the Late Middle Ages within
                    the domain of the natural sciences; clearly revealing its fidelity to the Latin
                    root radix [root], the term connoted that which is “of, belonging to, or from
                    the roots” (OED A.1.a). In its initial iteration it was wholly value neutral, as
                    only in the later 18th century did it acquire a political and thus contested
                    sense. It was first applied to politics in two related – but in fact distinct –
                    usages. In the first, “radical” came to function as a descriptor for a minority
                    faction within a larger political party that sought “thorough or far-reaching
                    political or social reform,” that is change that “goes to the roots” of existing
                    forms of social organization (OED A.7.b). In Britain the Radical wing of the
                    Liberal party sought the abolition of the property requirement for voting, while
                    the Radical Republicans in the United States agitated for the abolition of
                    slavery. Certainly these “radical” demands must strike we contemporaries as
                    relatively modest; indeed, even within their respective historical contexts they
                    would hardly seem to qualify as outrageous, given that universal (male, white)
                    suffrage hard largely been the norm in the U.S. since its founding, and that by
                    the time of the Emancipation Proclamation, chattel slavery was a distant memory
                    in the British Empire. Yet because these radical programs constituted an
                    existential threat to established centers of power, the British and American
                    radicals were of course denounced by their enemies in the second and deeply
                    value-laden sense of the term, namely that of “representing or supporting an
                    extreme section of a party.” The evolution of the term since the 19th century
                    has largely resulted in the collapse of this distinction, that is between change
                    that is “thorough and far-reaching” and “goes to the roots” and change that is
                    in its essence “extreme.” In contemporary Anglophone political usage, “radical”
                    is typically employed as pejorative against all those ideas deemed to be outside
                    the domain of the permissible; in effect it is a weapon for the enforcement of
                    ideological boundaries. </p>
                <p>In Denmark the term first acquires a political sense in the 1870s and 1880s,
                    always associated with Brandes and his circle, who were referred to as radical
                    authors. These literary radicals were closely aligned with the political
                    radicals, led by the critic’s brother Edvard (1847-1931) and the politician
                    Viggo Hørup (1841-1902), who together founded the daily <em>Politiken</em> in
                    1884 as an organ for radical commentary; the majority of Georg Brandes’
                    political journalism, in fact, first appeared in the paper. While the radical
                    movement did indeed seek change “at the roots” of existing social and political
                    organization, they did not at all conceive of their program as “extremist” in
                    nature. Certainly, their conservative enemies attempted to define them as such,
                    but this largely came to nothing, as almost immediately the radicals were
                    assimilated into mainstream politics, where they have remained ever since. In
                    the domain of electoral politics, the Danish radicals, like their British and
                    American namesakes, first emerged as a subset of larger party of a decidedly
                        <em>centrist</em> orientation, namely the Venstre, the descendant of the old
                    National Liberal party that had played the central role in the mid 19th century
                    transition to constitutional rule. On the Right they were opposed by the Højre
                    of J.B.S. Estrup (1825-1913), while the nascent Left was occupied by the small
                    but growing Danish Social Democratic party, founded by the postal worker Louis
                    Pio (1841-1894) just weeks before Brandes’ famous lecture of November 1871. The
                    split within the Venstre that began to emerge in the 1880s should thus be viewed
                    as a kind of “bourgeois intramural struggle,” a fissure between the more
                    conservative “national wing” of the party and its emergent “radical wing,” who
                    were also referred to as “the Europeans” for their generally internationalist
                    orientation. This split would be formalized in 1905, after Denmark transitioned
                    from limited to full parliamentary democracy, in the founding of the Radikale
                    Venstre party, which despite its name has remained up to the present a fixture
                    of the political Center, fully capable of forming governments with both the
                    Center Left and the Center Right. While their platform has evolved over the
                    years, the <em>Radikaler</em> have more or less consistently represented the
                    core Brandesian values of the expansion of individual rights, vigorous
                    internationalism and opposition to any form of militarism or belligerent
                    nationalism; today they are one of the few Danish parties committed to
                    protecting the rights of Denmark’s embattled immigrant communities. Their impact
                    on Danish politics and culture has been immense; indeed the period between 1871
                    and the monumental elections of 2001, which brought the Right back into power
                    and marked the emergence of the Far Right, anti-immigrant Danske Folkeparti
                    [Danish People’s Party], can aptly be described as Denmark’s “Long Radical
                    Century.” As Hans Hertel has noted, the DF framed the 2001 election as no less
                    than the liberation of Denmark from “one hundred and thirty years of so-called
                    cultural radical tyranny” (Hertel 2004:12).</p>
                <p>The Danish radical movement was and is far more than the political party that
                    bears its name; as the historian Leif Pjetursson has described, the original
                    understanding of the term was largely identified with a particular
                        <em>tankegang</em>, a <em>manner of thinking</em> that “takes things at
                    their roots” and is “penetrating and thorough,” a “critical and analytic
                    movement in which society is dissected (Pjetursson 1984:7). The roots of this
                    radical manner of thinking rested firmly within the 18th century Enlightenment,
                    as evidenced by Pjetursson’s metaphor of dissection; much as the 18th century
                    illuminista staked a claim to scientific rationality, so did Brandes initially
                    seek to bring literary praxis into greater accord with that of the natural
                    sciences. As a political ideology, radicalism largely took its cues from the
                    revolutionary and collectivist “humane” liberalism of Rousseau, which sought to
                    “cement together the singular will of the individual with the common will of
                    society,” in stark opposition to the strictly individualist “classical”
                    liberalism of Smith and Ricardo, which claimed as its point of departure “the
                    egoistic trait in human being” (Pjetursson 1984:13). As an essentially critical
                    “ideal liberalism,” Brandesian radicalism was in its essence an oppositional
                    movement, situated firmly against the hegemonic ideology of the age, that which
                    Johan Fjord Jensen has aptly deemed the <em>nationalliberale enhedskultur</em>
                    [national, or perhaps more properly, bourgeois culture of national unity]:</p>
                <blockquote>As culture it was hierarchical, built up on a series of institutions in
                    which . [...] the patriarchal family was central and holiest. It rested upon a
                    fixed moral system, which through written and unwritten rules of propriety
                    placed an endless series of limitations on human development. In its essence it
                    was static and self-protecting. It was pale and passionless in its understanding
                    of life, except for when it was confronted with aberrant forms of culture that
                    threatened it with rupture . [...] against such threats it reacted with a
                    passionate urge for self-preservation. (Fjord Jensen 1966:13).</blockquote>
                <p>As has been suggested, Brandesian radicalism did not in essence question the
                    fundamental ideals of bourgeois civilization; in contrast, these ideals, at
                    least in their original French revolutionary iteration, constitute the very
                    model of humane social organization. Radical critique thus seeks to expose the
                    failure of the Danish bourgeoisie to live up to its own ideals, to peek beyond
                    what Fjord Jensen terms its “façade morality.” The emphasis on getting to the
                    roots beyond this façade reveals the both the Brandesianism of Ibsen and the
                    Ibsenism of Brandes; as Franco Moretti has observed, Ibsen’s cycle of twelve
                    amounts to, in essence, a strikingly similar twenty-year “settling of accounts”
                    with the bourgeoisie (Moretti 2010:118).</p>

                <p>At long last we have arrived at a serviceable definition of Brandesian
                    radicalism: it is a socially critical movement characterized by a manner of
                    thinking that, more or less in tune with scientific inquiry, investigates
                    society at its roots, beneath the veil concealing the actually existing
                    bourgeois civilization of the late 19th century, in the effort to hold it to the
                    high and humane ideals expressed in its initial, revolutionary phase. The
                    apparent failure of the movement to produce concrete change in Danish politics
                    and culture did to a significant extent result in a certain measure of
                    disillusionment in the critic, yet his reinvention as a Nietzschean
                    “aristocratic radical” in the 1890s was by no means a rejection of his earlier
                    method. In absolute contrast, the thinking and praxis of the mature Brandes
                    constitutes a deepening of the project of radical critique, for at base the
                    critic comes to an understanding that his earlier approach was no longer
                    sufficient to meet the drastically changed political conditions of Europe and
                    the larger world.</p>
                <p>As has been previously noted, what had changed was the advent of Neocolonialism;
                    the dialectical interplay between revolution and reaction that had served to
                    structure <em>Main Currents</em> had been effectively undermined by the triumph
                    of empire. It should be emphasized that both the theoretical models of the young
                    critic, the Hegelian conception of history as under the guidance of abstract
                    Absolute Spirit as well as the Nietzschean insistence on the singular great
                    individual, were firmly within the tradition of philosophical Idealism. In both
                    views it is spirit, whether in the form of the abstract Idea or in the concrete
                    heroic actions of the single individual, that moves history. Neither approach,
                    as Olav Harsløf has illuminated, was sufficient to the changed circumstances of
                    Europe at the turn of the 20th century, for “the critical work could only
                    continue through the analysis of the elements that make up the reactionary unity
                    – racism, militarism, nationalism –, as well as their ultimate source,
                    imperialism” (Harsløf 1973:136). In order to get at the roots of the imperial
                    impulse, Brandes must gesture in a direction fundamentally alien to his nature,
                    namely the materialist (although, of course, non-Marxist) analysis of the
                    economic conditions of the Belle Epoque. It was for Brandes a complete
                    reorientation of his critical perspective, from the “horizontal”
                        <em>ideologikritik</em> of his early phase to the “vertical” understanding
                    of the economic determinants of social organization and culture, from “cultural
                    politics” to a “more economically grounded social critique” (Harsløf
                    1973:137-138). As the new century dawns, Brandes is seized by a new and powerful
                    sense of <em>urgency</em>; the old radical methodologies will no longer do, he
                    must make the fateful leap into direct intervention in affairs of state, he must
                    lend his name and his formidable reputation to the cause of the manifold of
                    oppressed peoples around the world.</p>

                <h1 id="rights">7. Brandes as International Tribune of the Rights of Peoples:
                    1900-1925</h1>

                <p>As has been argued, the general ideological framework of the mature Brandes was
                    riven with internal tensions, especially that between the seemingly unforgiving
                    and anti-democratic leanings of his “aristocratic” proclivities and the much
                    more generous spirit that characterizes his rights advocacy. With respect to the
                    former, the political journalism of his final quarter century is replete with
                    appeals to “the leading men” (as well as, occasionally, women) of one country or
                    another, revealing his continued belief in the capacity of “men of influence” to
                    produce real change. His 1904 call for a Pan-European movement in defense of the
                    university in Helsinki, which after the turn of the century was subjected to
                    increasingly harsh measures of Russification, is a telling example:</p>
                <blockquote>The student youth of the three Nordic countries, together with their
                    university teachers, ought to express their sympathy with students and teachers
                    at the university in Helsingfors and register their protest against the violence
                    and abuse that is inflicted on them. We dare hope that the movement then spreads
                    further, so that other countries’ universities, first and foremost England’s and
                    Germany’s, perhaps also France’s, surely Italy’s, attach themselves to the
                    protest, and that it therefore rolls over the Earth, steadily more polyphonic.
                    [Russian Interior Minister] Plehve should be made to understand that he cannot
                    take lightly such a pronouncement from Europe’s most enlightened class of men.
                    [...] It is our purpose to bring the Russian government to perceive itself
                    isolated, an isolation it more steadily begins to feel. [...] A similar sense of
                    isolation ought to be instilled among Russia’s leading men, the sense that they
                    are set apart from European civilization by Europe’s intellectual aristocracy.
                    This government has expelled Finland’s best men from their fatherland. In return
                    Europe must expel Russia from its culture. (Brandes 1906b:63-64). </blockquote>
                <p>While collective civil disobedience is a critical component of this strategy, it
                    is strictly limited to the educated classes; Brandes effectively hopes that
                    pressure from Western Europe’s university communities might provoke Russia’s
                    intelligentsia to apply similar pressure to the Czarist state, which would then
                    lead to an easing of its repressive policies. </p>
                <p>Yet the other side of Brandes, the critic as impassioned defender of the rights
                    of whole peoples, is also capable of speaking directly to those very same masses
                    elsewhere written off as “the mob.” Nowhere is this more apparent than in his
                    1916 “An Appeal,” a call for peace talks distributed in the millions in French
                    and German (but not in England, thanks to the efforts of the propaganda
                    bureau):</p>
                <blockquote>In the war-making countries the armies naturally desire first and
                    foremost victory, but most strongly they desire peace. The civilian population
                    everywhere groans for peace. The governments who sit high in the saddle kick the
                    spurs into the weary horse’s flanks. [...] The cries for peace that soon shall
                    arise in all states are called cowardly. But if the people keep silent then the
                    stones will speak. Everywhere the ruins scream for peace, not for revenge. And
                    where the stones remain silent, the fields and the meadows, drenched in blood
                    and strewn with corpses, cry out. (Brandes 1916:256-257).</blockquote>
                <p>The “great men” of the 20th century, if the perpetrators of the war could be
                    called such, have failed entirely in their duty; indeed, it was one such “most
                    enlightened man,” the aforementioned William Archer, who had been primarily
                    responsible for suppressing the appeal in the United Kingdom. In the absence of
                    extraordinary individuals, it is only the people themselves who might put an end
                    to this “singular tragedy.”</p>
                <p>The general theoretical conception of the rights of peoples underpinning the
                    critic’s praxis as international tribune is of immense complexity, and is
                    further characterized by a strong measure of internal consistency. While an
                    overview of its basic features is outside the scope of this essay, a detailed
                    analysis of Brandes’ thinking about rights – including a treatment of the
                    essential question of whether the critic’s peculiar form of rights advocacy
                    ought to be considered a precursor of the specifically <em>human</em> rights
                    advocacy that would catch fire in the decades after the Second World War – is
                    provided in my forthcoming volume, <em>Georg Brandes. Human Rights and Oppresses
                        Peoples. Essays and Speeches</em>, which is briefly discussed below in
                    section VIa. </p>
                <p>With respect to the critic’s practice as rights advocate, as mentioned above, his
                    production was generally divided into two periods of sustained activity, the
                    first beginning in the summer of 1900 and stretching forward through 1905, after
                    which his activity tapers off until resuming in earnest with the outbreak of the
                    Great War. As described, Brandes’ 25 years of advocacy work is characterized by
                    its steadily expanding scope, although also as noted he in fact begins with a
                    vigorous critique of the punitive campaign of the Eight Nation Alliance against
                    the Boxer Rebels of China. For the most part, however, his first period is
                    dominated by his concern for the subject peoples of Eurasia. Most prominent
                    among them are of course the long-suffering Poles, with whom the critic had
                    maintained close relations since his long journey through the old homeland in
                    the 1880s, which he had chronicled in his 1888 volume <em>Impressions of
                        Poland</em>. The appearance of this long ignored book in German translation
                    in 1898 invoked both the enduring love of the people of Poland as well as the
                    considerable ire of the Germans, and thus it was only natural that he would come
                    to take the lead in presenting the Polish civil struggles against both
                    Germanization and Russification efforts to Western Europe. Also of great
                    significance to the critic during this period was the fate of Armenian
                    population of the Ottoman Empire, of which he had become aware through his
                    contact with the Armenian exile activists Avetis Nazarbekian (1866-1939) and
                    Mariam Vardanian (1864-1941). His chilling accounts of the mid-1890s “Hamidian”
                    massacres, the October 1900 essay “Armenia” and the February 1903 Berlin address
                    “Armenia and Europe,” are among the first West European treatments of the
                    initial outbreak of mass killing in Eastern Anatolia that, despite the actions
                    of the critic and his Pro-Armenia allies, did not awaken the continent to coming
                    even greater catastrophe of 1915-1917. In addition to a miscellany of other
                    European subject peoples for whom he advocated during this period, Brandes also
                    addressed the rising specter of anti-Semitism in addition to, as previously
                    noted, the growing Zionist movement, with which he maintained difficult
                    relations. </p>
                <p>The eruption of the Guns of August in 1914 summoned the critic back to advocacy
                    in earnest, as he quickly emerged, along with the French author Romain Rolland
                    (1866-1944), as a leader of the tiny anti-war movement. While his aforementioned
                    feuds with Clemenceau in France and Archer in Britain amounted to a direct
                    confrontation with the allegedly high-minded war aims of the Allies, his wartime
                    journalism is in general preoccupied with the fate of the neutral peoples caught
                    up in the conflict, the Poles and the Armenians, of course, but also the
                    Belgians and the Persians. As previously noted, it was this second period of
                    activity, his principled opposition to the war aims and conduct of all sides,
                    that cost Brandes most dearly; for a generation of Frenchmen and Englishmen, he
                    would always remain “Mr. Facing-Both-Ways.”</p>
                <p>After the war Brandes’ activity as political journalist subsided again, although
                    one effort, his 1922 Christiania address “Imperialism,” deserves special mention
                    here, as it sheds a great deal of light on the evolution of his thinking about
                    the rights of peoples as well as, importantly, the relationship between his
                    political activity and his better remembered literary work. It can often seem,
                    as has been stressed throughout this essay, that these two aspects of the mature
                    critic’s production are in at least some sense in tension with one another. Yet
                    in one critical sense they are indeed mutually reinforcing. They key text here
                    is Brandes’ long under-appreciated 1899 essay “World Literature,” which because
                    of the new interest in the concept of <em>Weltliteratur</em> in recent decades
                    has finally begun to receive the attention it deserves. When Goethe first began
                    to use the term in the late 1820s, he seemed to have had in mind something like
                    convergence. Because of the long period of peace following the Napoleonic Wars
                    as well as, even more importantly, increased global exchange – not just of
                    material goods but also of ideas and of literary works – the old form “of
                    National literature means little now, the age of <em>Weltliteratur</em> has
                    begun” (cited in D’haen et al. 2013:11). From Brandes’ perspective at the
                    conclusion of the 19th century, much of this is taken for granted, although the
                    critic, revealing his inherent sympathy for all small languages and literatures,
                    places all of the emphasis on the fundamental unfairness of the world literary
                    system, in which “an author of the sixth rank in a widespread language, a world
                    language, can with ease become more known than an author of the second rank in a
                    language spoken by only a few million” (cited in D’haen et al. 2013:25). And
                    further demonstrating his essential national cosmopolitanism, Brandes proceeds
                    to attack those who, seduced by the prospect of world renown, “have begun to
                    write for a general and unspecified public,” those who – the specific target
                    here is Zola – write “as Sarah Bernhardt acts when she performs in Peru or
                    Chicago. In contrast to this new phenomenon of “writing for the world,” the
                    critic insists that the writer must “work in the land in which he was born and
                    write for his countrymen” that the work might carry “the scent of the
                    earth.”</p>
                <p>It is likely no coincidence that “World Literature” and “Thoughts at the Turn of
                    the Century” were produced in the very same year. Both are underpinned by a
                    conception of the world system as an unequal struggle between major and minor
                    powers, between colonizer and colonized, whether in the literary realm or in the
                    domain of power politics. He seems to have grasped intuitively what Benedict
                    Anderson would later make explicit, that the fate of oppressed peoples the world
                    over is intimately bound to language, to national literature. He would make this
                    clear in what is arguably the most stirring of his political works, the 1905
                    letter “To the Schoolchildren of Russian Poland,” who had recently declared a
                    national strike in protest against the banning of the Polish language in the
                    school system:</p>
                <blockquote>You have acted out of your best and surest natural instincts; out of
                    enthusiasm for the most undeniable of human rights, that to speak and read one’s
                    language; out of enthusiasm for that language itself, in which immortal works
                    are written; out of enthusiastic love of your people, your country and its
                    history, but especially its future. (Brandes 1906c:43-44) </blockquote>
                <p>In some sense, then, Brandes’ activity as international tribune for the
                        <em>rights</em> of peoples can be seen as a complement to, perhaps even an
                    outgrowth of, his work as international advocate for the <em>literatures</em> of
                    (small) peoples. This is evident over and over again in his political
                    journalism, as the critic constantly invokes the literary accomplishments of a
                    given people as an argument in its defense. Julie Allen has astutely identified
                    this uniquely Brandesian form of “cultural defense,” noting that his work on
                    behalf of Armenia:</p>
                <blockquote>does not invoke sympathy as the sole or even the primary rise for coming
                    to the aid of the Armenians, but rather culture, both admiration for the
                    cultural wealth created by Armenians over the past four thousand years and fear
                    of the destructive effect of tacit complicity on European culture. (Allen
                    2012:110). </blockquote>
                <p>At times, indeed, this overwhelming preoccupation with literature can strike the
                    contemporary reader as at least somewhat strange, even after all Anderson has
                    taught us. In his May 1917 essay “The Armenians,” written after the mass murder
                    of hundreds of thousands, the critic is still, for example, at pains to remind
                    the reader that “in our time the Armenians have upheld their old reputation as
                    poets and artists,” and that no less a Brandesian luminary than Lord Byron had
                    been motivated to study their language and literature (Brandes 1917b:365).</p>
                <p>As has been suggested, Brandes’ employment of his form of “cultural defense” and
                    the pronounced bias for literary culture it reveals raises a critical question
                    regarding his theoretical conception of the rights of peoples, namely that of
                    whether the critic is possessed of some measure of civilizational bias. The
                    absence in his political journalism of the untold millions of indigenous peoples
                    who came under the European thumb during his lifetime is indeed conspicuous,
                    although it can at least in part be explained by the fact that, since so many of
                    the newly colonized were preliterate, he simply lacked his best means of
                    defending them. The two non-European peoples for whom he did advocate
                    extensively, the Chinese and the Persians, were furthermore possessed of ancient
                    cultural traditions far older than those of Europe; just as importantly, the
                    efforts of European Orientalists have of course led to a profound appreciation
                    of their cultural achievements, if indeed they were seen as located in the
                    distant past rather than the present. Whatever doubts might persist regarding
                    the universality of Brandes’ conception of the rights of peoples, however, are
                    dispelled entirely by the aforementioned 1922 address “Imperialism,” delivered
                    in Christiania rather than in Copenhagen, likely an acknowledgement of Denmark’s
                    colonial entanglements that continue to this day. He begins by recalling a
                    previous visit to the Norwegian capital, shortly before the outbreak of the war
                    he had long foreseen. At that time, in a distant echo of Nietzsche, the critic
                    had concluded by asserting that the coming catastrophe would necessitate a
                    revaluation of all values. Eight years and millions of deaths later, the critic
                    laments, little has changed: </p>
                <blockquote>The wish I had expressed in my final sentence, that “the old ideals must
                    be replaced with new ones,” has by no means come true. The old ideal,
                    imperialism as the expression of nationalism, is at the moment dominate in all
                    the countries whose attitude means something for the population of the world,
                    the unfortunate mass of humanity. (Brandes 1932:158) </blockquote>
                <p>What follows is an impassioned and scathing indictment of persistent European
                    imperialism, planetary in its scope and breathtaking in its indignation. Most
                    importantly, the old practice of “cultural defense” of oppressed peoples is
                    entirely absent, as the critic forcefully and without reservation asserts the
                    right of all peoples, regardless of the “level of civilizational
                    accomplishment,” to self-determination and to dignity. Even at the age of
                    eighty, it seems, Brandes remained fully capable of self-reinvention and
                    renewal.</p>

                <h1 id="bibliographyA">8A. Bibliography: Brandes' Political Journalism</h1>
                <p>Relative to his literary work, Brandes’ rights advocacy journalism was as noted
                    characterized by a greater sense of urgency; indeed, a great many of the
                    speeches and articles were produced on request, from representatives of the
                    various oppressed peoples he encountered during his European travels and through
                    his extensive correspondence. Since the critic served as his own editor for his
                        <em>Samlede Skrifter</em> (as well as the additional collections published
                    after the completion of the SS in 1910 and before his death in 1927), he
                    typically produced revised versions of the original newspaper and journal
                    articles, intended as authoritative editions for purposes of future scholarship.
                    In preparing my volume, Ge<em>org Brandes. Human Rights and Oppresses Peoples.
                        Essays and Speeches</em>. (Wisconsin, forthcoming in 2020), I have therefore
                    chosen to honor’s the critic’s wishes by using these “posterity versions” as the
                    source texts for my English translations. </p>
                    <p>The forthcoming critical edition includes all of Brandes’ major works on
                    oppressed peoples, in total 35 essays and addresses, produced between 1900 and
                    1925. The following list includes titles (in English), original publication
                    dates (for the Danish versions; many of these appeared simultaneously abroad in
                    other languages), original venues of publication, and the locations of the
                    posterity versions used as source texts.</p>

                    <p>Because the forthcoming
                    volume is limited to the critic’s writings on international political affairs,
                    it does not include Brandes’ extensive advocacy journalism in the national
                    sphere. These essays on the Sønderjylland Question, produced between the mid
                    1890s through the resolution of the conflict, are as noted collected in Danish
                    in the volume <em>Sønderjylland under Prøjsisk Tryk </em>(Gyldendal, 1919). The
                    forthcoming volume also excludes much of the critic’s writings on the Great War,
                    which after first appearing in newspapers and journals around the world were
                    collected in the volume Verdenskrigen (4 eds., Gyldendal, 1916-1917), as well as
                    the whole of the critic’s commentaries on the peace, <em>Tragediens anden Del:
                        Fredslutningen</em> [The Tragedy’s Second Act: The Peace Settlement]
                    (Gyldendal, 1919). I have included only those essays from <em>Verdenskrigen</em>
                    (marked VK above) that have direct bearing on the general theme of the volume,
                    that is Brandes’ advocacy work on behalf of oppressed peoples, in this context
                    the neutral nations (Poland, Belgium, Persia etc.) caught up in the maelstrom of
                    the conflict. The entirety of the first edition of <em>Verdenskrigen</em>,
                    however, was superbly translated by the American peace activist Catherine Groth,
                    appearing in the U.S. (but not Britain) as <em>The World at War </em>(Macmillan,
                    1917). </p>

        <head>I</head>

        <head>THE POLITICAL BACKGROUND</head>

        <p>From the days of the Holy Alliance onward, the spirit of systematic reaction brooded over
          the German countries--a reaction which dated from the Congress of Vienna, and had its
          centre in Austria. Its most typical representative, Metternich, a pupil of Talleyrand, a
          less adroit but far more mischievous man than his master, hoped to extend it to the whole
          of Europe. Everything that had been shaken, loosened, or overturned by the Revolution or
          by Napoleon was to be repaired and re-established. In the struggle with the great enemy
          they had been obliged at last to resort to every possible method, had been forced to
          appeal to the people instead of simply commanding, to appeal to their sentiment in place
          of their allegiance, and even to promise a thing as contrary to all cabinet policy, as
          youthfully revolutionary, as "the regeneration of Germany." There had been, it is true, a
          very noticeable difference between the Austrian and the Prussian watchwords. "Justice and
          Order," "Order and Peace," were the cues of the Austrian proclamations; those of the
          Prussian were "The Nation," "Freedom and Honour," "Germany." Still both of the great
          German States had made more concessions to the spirit of the times than at all suited the
          ideas of their leading statesmen. And no sooner was the enemy driven off, the heir of the
          Revolution crippled, and "the war of freedom" ended, than it became their object to put an
          end to the freedom as they had put an end to the war.</p>

        <p>The generation that had grown up during the war with <pb n="2"/> France had expected to
          see a united Germany arise as the result of victory. As far back as 1812, Stein had
          sketched a plan for the reunion of the scattered parts of the former German Empire, and
          Arndt and Görres had given expression to the same idea. But the Peace of Paris, in 1814,
          decreed: "The German States shall be independent, and united by a federative league;" and
          herewith all hopes of unification were dashed to the ground. Almost a generation passed
          before the people were again animated by the thought. In place of the unified State arose
          the German Confederacy, _der deutsche Bund_, or, as Jahn called it, _Bunt_, a
          many-coloured harlequin's garb for the nation; and the disappointment was a bitter
          one.</p>

        <p>The dream of freedom shared the fate of the dream of unification. To animate their
          peoples in the struggle with Napoleon, several of the princes had promised them
          constitutional government. Of the larger States, only Bavaria, Baden, and Würtemberg, the
          former members of the Napoleonic Rhenish Confederacy, kept these promises. Bavaria and
          Baden received constitutions in 1818; Würtemberg, where for once the king was more
          liberally minded than the estates, in 1819; and in little Saxe-Weimar, Karl August, the
          pioneer of political freedom in Germany, had given his people a free constitution and
          inaugurated a Parliamentary idyll as far back as 1816.</p>

        <p>All this, however, was of small significance in view of the fact that Austria, after, as
          well as before, the Peace, represented the reactionary principle, and that Prussia, with a
          population more inclined than any of the others to political activity, adhered
          unhesitatingly to the Metternichian principles.</p>

        <p>Yet the Prussian people not only desired a constitution, but possessed a right to it.
          They had it in black and white. In an edict of 1810, the Chancellor, Prince Hardenberg,
          the restorer of the power of Prussia, had held out the prospect of representative
          government. During the war with Napoleon the promise had been repeated, and finally, in an
          ordinance of the 22nd of May 1815, a formal promise had been made to the people, a clear
            <pb n="3"/> intimation of the king's intention to appoint without delay a committee
          whose task it should be to prepare the draft of a constitution. But as the Metternichian
          principles gained ground, the realisation of this plan was postponed. When Görres ventured
          to present to Hardenberg an address from the Rhine provinces, in which the King of Prussia
          was reminded of his promise, the only answer he received was, that the king who had given
          the promise had also, in his wisdom, reserved the right to judge of the proper time for
          its fulfilment. On several later occasions the king declared himself to be bound by his
          promise, but at the same time always insisted that the question of time must be left to
          his fatherly care to decide. And meanwhile full twenty-five years passed--the rest of the
          king's life.[1]</p>

        <p>The object of the Powers was to eradicate every trace of the Napoleonic administration.
          In Hanover, for example, the _Code Napoléon_, with its public, verbal judicial
          proceedings, was abolished, and the old inquisitional system of the sixteenth century,
          with its secret modes of procedure, was re-established. The peasants, who had been
          liberated by the French, had to return to serfdom and villeinage. The principle of
          equality before the law was set at naught, the aristocracy re-acquiring the political and
          social privileges which they had possessed in the eighteenth century.</p>

        <p>And just as the first germs of a freer political life were ready to sprout in South
          Germany, an event occurred which gave the signal for much stronger, much hastier reaction,
          one symptom of which was the employment of the most violent measures in the repression of
          unimportant and innocent expressions of popular feeling. This event was the assassination
          of Kotzebue, or, to be more correct, the enthusiasm for the assassin which his deed
          awakened throughout Germany, then suffering from oppression and espionage.</p>

        <p>The strong national feeling and the enthusiasm for freedom which had asserted themselves
          during the conflict with France, had in the years following on that <pb n="4"/> conflict
          given birth to two movements among the youth of Germany, to which the attention of the
          Governments were now directed--the gymnastic and the student movement (Turnwesen and
          Burschenschaftswesen).</p>

        <p>Jahn, the populariser of gymnastics, who succeeded Fichte in the favour of the youth of
          Germany, opened the first school of gymnastics in Berlin. He had belonged to Lützow's
          free-lance Jaegercorps, was a German of Germans and a hater of the French, and went about
          with his long, unkempt grey hair hanging over his shoulders, bare-necked, his broad
          shirt-collar thrown wide open, and a thick, knotted stick in his hand. In the course of
          the holiday excursions which he made with his pupils, whenever they came upon a French
          sign-board or met a fashionably-dressed man, they would draw up round the object of their
          detestation, bawling: "Oh! Oh!" On these excursions the strictest temperance in food and
          drink was observed; they lived chiefly on bread and water, and bivouacked at night under
          the open sky. From round the fire rose the strains of the worthy Massmann's beautiful
          _Turnerwanderlied:_</p>

        <p> "Stubenwacht, Ofenpacht, Hat die Herzen weich gemacht, Wanderfahrt, Turnerart Macht sie
          frank und hart."[2]</p>

        <p>This Massmann, who, besides being one of the leaders of the gymnastic movement, was one
          of the founders of the students' unions (Burschenschaften), is the same who figures so
          frequently as scapegoat in Heine's poems and prefaces.[3]</p>

        <p>Jahn soon became the object of the most ardent admiration, not only on the part of
          immature youth, but of men of note and of public bodies. Poets inscribed their verses to
          him; a philologist like Thiersch dedicated his _Pindar_ to him, and compared German to
          Greek gymnastics; two <pb n="5"/> universities invested him with an honorary degree. He
          himself was a most loyal subject, but it was the fashion among his long-haired,
          bare-necked gymnasts with the unbleached linen jackets to jeer at the army, especially at
          the dandy officers of the guard. They raved, too, against abstract enemies; among their
          rules was one for the assassination of the enemy of the good cause; they were to aim with
          a dagger at his eyes, and, when the victim covered his face, to strike at his heart.</p>

        <p>This movement emanated from Berlin, the student movement from Thuringia. The latter began
          as a sort of semi-national, semi-Christian enthusiasm, and aimed among other things at the
          reform of the low standard of manners and morals among the students. Originating in one of
          the small States of Germany, it took for its programme that famous song of Arndt's which
          declares the whole of Germany to be the German's fatherland.</p>

        <p>Amongst the Jena professors a certain Fries had most influence among the students, the
          same Fries who, in the preface to Hegel's _Philosophy of Right_, is loaded with invective
          as being the representative of shallowness. He was a violent Liberal, who had said that
          Hegel's new theories did not grow in the gardens of science, but in the hotbeds of
          servility; and under his fostering care the endeavour after unity and abstract liberty
          spread amongst the youth of the universities. The banner of the Burschen was black, red,
          and gold, said to have been suggested by the colours of the uniform of Lützow's Corps,
          black, with red facings and gold buttons.</p>

        <p>The Reformation commemoration-festival in 1817 first drew general attention to the
          gymnastic and student societies (Turner and Burschen). It had suggested the idea of a
          meeting at the Wartburg of delegates from all the German student unions. In a pamphlet
          published on the occasion of the festival by Karl Sand, he names as the three enemies of
          German nationalism from time immemorial, Roman imperialism, monasticism, and militarism.
          On the 18th of October, five hundred students, headed by several professors, marched up
          from Eisenach to the Wartburg, where they dined in the Knights' Hall, placed at their
          disposal by the <pb n="6"/> liberal Karl August. After the repast the gymnasts gave a
          display of their agility for the benefit of the astonished natives. In the evening great
          bonfires were lighted, and then Jahn proposed that, following the example of Luther, who
          had burned the Papal Bull, they should burn what the enemies of the good cause had
          written. Massmann feelingly expressed his approval of the proposal, and bundles of old
          printed paper were produced, on which were inscribed the titles of the detested books
          written by the enemies of the gymnasts. There were three by the notorious Schmalz, the
          first Rector of the University of Berlin, the Police Statute Book of the equally notorious
          Prussian Minister of Justice, Herr von Kamptz, the _Code Napoléon_, Kotzebue's _Deutsche
          Geschichte_, Haller's _Restauration_, &amp;c, &amp;c. The last things thrown into the
          flames were a Uhlan's corset, a queue, and a corporal's baton.[4]</p>

        <p>When Fries in high-flown language bade the students farewell, he particularly impressed
          on them that they had been in the country of German liberty, liberty of action and of
          thought: "Here there is no standing army," &amp;c.; an expression rendered more absurd by
          the fact that the army of Weimar consisted of a number of worthy artisans, who at times,
          in consideration of a small payment, appeared as hussars, with high riding-boots and
          spurs, but without horses. In Hegel's preface to the _Philosophy of Right_ he remarks, _à
          propos_ of this speech, that Fries was not ashamed, on the occasion of a notorious public
          demonstration, to say of the constitution of the State that it was from below, from the
          people, that life would come, if true public spirit prevailed; that only by the sacred
          chain of friendship could a community, a society, be inviolably united. Hegel calls this
          the very hall-mark of shallowness, this melting down of the elaborate architecture of a
          rationally designed state into "a broth of feeling, friendship, and enthusiasm."</p>

        <p>Massmann published an account of the festival, in which he described how night still
          brooded over Germany, but proclaimed that the blood-red dawn was about to break.</p>

        <p>Metternich succeeded in persuading both Prince Harden<pb n="7"/>berg and the Emperor
          Alexander to bring pressure to bear on Karl August in the matter of this festival, and
          ever afterwards Karl August's nickname at the court of Vienna was "der Altbursche."</p>

        <p>Amongst the books burnt in effigy at the Wartburg were some of Kotzebue's. Kotzebue was
          publishing at this time in Weimar his _Litterarisches Wochenblatt_, a journal which
          flattered Russia and made merry over the youth of Germany. Little as Goethe generally
          sympathised with youth, he rejoiced with them, for once, at the insult offered to his old
          enemy.[5]</p>

        <p>As Councillor of the Russian Legation, Kotzebue from time to time sent communications to
          St. Petersburg, and was consequently supposed to be a Russian spy. It is probable that his
          communications were no more than harmless reports on literary matters, but, be this as it
          may, in the eyes of the students, he was Beelzebub--Beltze- or Kotze-bue. At the
          University of Giessen at this time, under the leadership of three brothers Follen,
          fanatical Republicans, a species of Radicalism had developed, which gloated over the idea
          of the assassination of tyrants and their instruments. In the students' songs such
          expressions occurred as: "Freiheitsmesser gezückt!--Hurrah! den Dolch durch die Kehle
          gedrückt." (Draw freedom's knife from its sheath!--Hurrah! Thrust the poniard into the
          throat.) Karl Follen, the leading spirit, had completely under his influence that young,
          narrow-minded mystic, Karl Sand, who had the image of Jesus constantly before his eyes,
          and who, on the 23rd of March 1819, drove his poniard into old Kotzebue's neck. On a strip
          of paper which he left lying beside the corpse, was, amongst other writing, this line by
          Follen: "You, too, may be a Christ."</p>

        <p>It was perfectly clear that this murder, committed in a moment of religious exaltation,
          could not be laid to the charge of the Liberal youth of Germany; nevertheless, and <pb
            n="8"/> more especially as Sand became a species of saint in the popular estimation,
          Metternich and Gentz, the Emperor of Austria, the King of Prussia, and the Czar, who was
          irritated by this expression of Russophobia, took united action, and the Resolutions of
          Karlsbad were passed--provisional, exceptional legislation for the universities, the
          "demagogues," and the press. Thus a censorship of the German press came into existence,
          answering to that prevailing in Russia now. Gentz was not mistaken when he called this the
          greatest retrograde movement that had taken place for thirty years.</p>

        <p>Under the pretext of combating a great revolutionary party, which they knew did not
          exist, the Governments began a war of persecution against what was then called Liberalism.
          Even the professor of theology at the University of Berlin, De Wette, was dismissed,
          because he had written a private letter of condolence to Sand's mother, which was seized
          and opened by the police. The reaction went the length of attacking the men who
          represented the German national feeling which had arisen during the war. Jahn was
          arrested, first confined in a fortress, and then sent to live in a small town under police
          supervision. Arndt was entangled, as a "demagogue," in a criminal case, and lost his
          appointment. Görres, who was dismissed, escaped over the frontier.</p>

        <p>In Prussia the censorship was not only exercised in the case of books and newspapers
          printed in the country, but extended to foreign printed matter. All German newspapers
          published in England, France, or Holland were forbidden. The whole stocks of some
          publishers, Brockhaus, for example, were subjected to a special censorship, on account of
          one or two pamphlets published by them. At all the universities trusted agents of the
          Government were appointed to watch over the disposition of the students and the lectures
          of the professors. All gymnastic and student societies were put down. The so-called old
          German dress, and the black, red, and gold colours were forbidden. The police especially
          distinguished themselves in the carrying out of these last prohibitions; they hunted
          coats, caps, tassels, ribbons, and pipe-bowls, and any man caught wearing a straw hat, a
            <pb n="9"/> red waistcoat, and a black coat was imprisoned on a charge, of high
          treason.</p>

        <p>Some Marburg students in the Twenties had ordered foils from a manufactory in Solingen,
          and it was reported that the usual trade-mark, "Prince," was wanting on these particular
          foils. The government of Hesse-Cassel instituted an inquiry for the purpose of discovering
          if the omission had been ordered by the students. To the great annoyance of the police, no
          cause for accusation was found. "I am sorry for your statesmen," said the French Minister,
          Comte de Serre, to the famous Niebuhr about this time; "they are making war on
          students."</p>

        <p>A specially keen look-out was kept for prohibited combinations among students. When
          Arnold Ruge was imprisoned, Herr von Kamptz set the whole police on the chase after a
          walking-stick belonging to him, on which the names of some Jena students were carved, the
          _corpus delicti_ being finally confiscated in Stralsund. Ruge was tortured by long pauses
          between his examinations, having to spend the intervals in a cell where life was rendered
          unendurable by vermin. Fritz Reuter had to expiate the crime of having "worn the German
          colours in broad daylight" by imprisonment, first in a miserable hole in Berlin, and after
          having been condemned for high treason, in dirty fortress cells. A youthful political
          offender in Bavaria was sentenced to fortress-imprisonment for treason on an indictment of
          which one of the gravest clauses was that something resembling a German prince's robe had
          been found in his room. Chiefly at the instigation of Austria, thousands of young
          Prussians were either imprisoned or driven into exile. In short, the Liberal middle-class
          youth of the Germany of those days was as unprotected by the law and as much persecuted as
          are, in our days, the Socialistic youth of the fourth estate of the same country, or the
          Liberal youth of Russia.</p>

        <p>Political and religious reaction went, as usual, hand in hand. In the year 1821, the
          Prussian Government concluded a concordat with the Pope, which gave the Roman Catholic
          Church an influence in Prussia such as would have been unimaginable under Frederick the
          Great. In the <pb n="10"/> following year a new liturgy, more nearly resembling the Roman,
          was introduced into the Protestant Church. And it is exceedingly significant that the word
          Protestantism now fell into disrepute. By a Ministerial decree of the year 1821, the terms
          Protestant and Protestantism were forbidden in Prussia; the censors received orders not to
          pass these words, but to substitute the word Evangelical.</p>

        <p>The sadness that takes possession of all progressively inclined minds during long and
          apparently hopeless periods of reaction now weighed upon the spiritual _élite_ of Germany.
          But the great majority fell a quick prey to carelessness and political indifference. With
          the reaction, at first forced on them from without, they soon familiarised themselves.
          Many began to be of opinion that a representative constitution, such as had been promised
          to Prussia, was a thing of no value. Others felt it deeply that Prussia, which had made
          such sacrifices in the war with Napoleon, had not succeeded in obtaining a constitution,
          while the South German States, which had to the last made common cause with the enemy, had
          long enjoyed popular government and the privilege of Parliamentary debate; but they
          concealed their shame under a mask of contempt for these skirmishers, a contempt that had
          a strong family resemblance to envy and anger. It was malevolently pointed out that the
          Bundestag, in which Austria and Prussia predominated, took good care that the trees of the
          South German Parliamentary system were well pruned down. The various Governments had,
          moreover, succeeded in bringing such opposition as arose in the South German States into
          disrepute. Ministers often succeeded in preventing an election that was objectionable to
          them; they also won over opponents by direct bribery or fear of dismissal; and they had
          always the final resource, to which they frequently resorted, of completely disregarding
          the oppositionist resolutions of the Chambers. As the power was in the hands of the
          Governments, it lay in the nature of things that the proceedings of the Parliaments, up to
          1830, were of no serious interest.</p>

        <p>The German press had never occupied a high position. All discussion of State matters
          being now prohibited, it had <pb n="11"/> to confine itself, as regarded politics, to the
          simple chronicling of facts, and to fill its columns with court news, accounts of storms
          and floods, the birth of marvellous monsters in the animal, and the appearance of new
          stars in the theatrical, world.</p>

        <p>The cultivated classes sought a kind of compensation for their exclusion from politics in
          a frantically exaggerated interest in the theatre. Never had the adoration of a prima
          donna or a ballet-dancer been carried to such an extreme. In the Berlin of the Twenties
          every other interest was swallowed up in the question of the superiority of German or
          Italian music. People thought of nothing but the rivalry between Spontini and Weber. When
          Börne came to Berlin in 1828, the public mind was so engrossed with the famous singer,
          Henriette Sontag, that no one remembered anything about Börne, except that he had written
          an article on her. In his _Letters from Paris_ (in "Härings-Salat") he gives a witty and
          yet veracious account of how he was met and saluted everywhere with the cry: "This is the
          man who wrote about Sontag!" Even in 1832, everything--the agitation in France, the Polish
          defeat, sympathy with the exiled Poles--everything was forgotten in the enthusiasm for the
          feet of the great _danseuse_ Taglioni, which were then setting out on their triumphal
          progress through Europe. The chief representative of the reactionary spirit in Prussia,
          the Hofmarschall and future diplomatist, General Theodor Heinrich von Rochow, writes in
          May 1832 to von Nagler, the Postmaster-General: "She is to dance, consequently there is
          great rejoicing, and occupation in abundance.... Taglioni's mimetic grace has dispelled
          the threatening signs of the times."[6] The word occupation here is significant. The
          performance did not merely please, it occupied.[7]</p>

        <p>As regards literature, the generation of that day luxuriated in an idolisation of the
          octogenarian Goethe, which <pb n="12"/> accepted everything that the aged master wrote or
          said as wisdom, and beauty, and inspired poetry. All his life long he had had to struggle
          against hatred and misunderstanding; now the reverence for him verged on the ridiculous;
          in Berlin it verged on idiocy.[8] In Zelter's _Letters to Goethe_ he writes, on the
          subject of the latter's _Elpenor_: "Posterity will not believe that the sun of our days
          beheld the forthcoming of such a work."[9] All those who had obstructed Goethe's path so
          long as his name still belonged to combatant literature, became his votaries from the
          moment that that name conveyed undisputed authority, and could be employed as a sort of
          Conservative and national emblem. Otherwise literature languished. The day of romantic
          poetical fancy was at an end--Raupach and Müllner ruled the stage, Clauren fiction. Light
          literature sank deeper and deeper into the slough of vulgarity and pruriency.</p>

        <head>PHILOSOPHY AND REACTION</head>

        <p>German philosophy, all the branches of which shot out vigorously after the flood of
          Romanticism had fertilised the ground with its deposit, at the same time changed colour.
          Through the unpropitiousness of circumstances, it became farther removed from reality than
          heretofore, though more closely bound up with existing conditions.</p>

        <p>Hegel is the great example. In March 1819, Karl Sand murdered Kotzebue; on the 22nd of
          October of the preceding year, Hegel entered on his professorial duties at the University
          of Berlin. From the programme which he gave his audience in his opening address, it could
          be clearly deduced that Hegel's philosophy and the Prussian State in its existing form
          were closely connected; for the said philosophy was based on the omnipotence of the Idea,
          the State on the power of intelligence and culture. Of the fact that Prussia, allowing
          herself to be led by Austria, was at this very time proving false to her character and
          traditions by entering on a policy of spiritual and political reaction, no account was
          taken. Yet the Resolutions of Carlsbad were already drafted, and it was Prussia that took
          the initiative in issuing all the petty tyrannical regulations which soon placed the whole
          of Germany under police surveillance. But the sentimental politics of the students were as
          obnoxious to Hegel as sentimental philosophy; the Wartburg rendezvous was to him a piece
          of romantic foolery, and Sand's poniard-thrust an abomination. In the preface to the
          _Philosophy of Right_, the first and most important work he produced in Berlin, he not
          only condescended to defend the persecution of the demagogues, but demeaned himself by
          playing police agent, and denouncing his former colleague, Fries, to the Governments: "It
          is to be hoped that neither office nor <pb n="14"/> title will serve as a talisman for
          principles destructive both of morality and public order." From this time onward Hegel
          became the philosophic dictator of Germany. He ruled from Berlin over the whole domain of
          German thought.</p>

        <p>Yet in this same philosophy, even in a work with such a pronounced Conservative tendency
          as the _Philosophy of Right_ there existed a portentous ambiguity. As early as in the
          above-mentioned notorious preface we find the proposition which was to become the classic
          motto of the age, which was first appropriated eagerly by the Conservatism of the
          Restoration period, and then used as a battering-ram by Hegel's younger disciples. It is
          in larger print than the rest, in two lines:</p>

        <p> "What is rational is real, What is real is rational."</p>

        <p>What does this mean? Hegel goes on to explain that when reflection, feeling, or whatever
          other form the subjective consciousness may assume, regards the present as vanity, it is
          itself false, finds itself in emptiness. But, on the other hand, the doctrine that the
          idea is a mere idea or figment, philosophy meets with the assertion that nothing is real
          except the idea. What is all-important is to recognise that which is eternal in the
          present, temporal, transient; in other words, in this case, not to construct a state, but
          to understand the state as it exists.</p>

        <p>Hegel's biographer, Haym, rightly says that not even the doctrine of divine right is so
          dangerous as this, which declares everything existing to be sacred. But, on the other
          hand, it may with equal right be maintained that not even the destructive ardour of the
          youthful revolutionaries went so far as this doctrine, which grants reality only to what
          is rational, and to all else nothing but a mock reality, which can and should be defied,
          disregarded, overturned, exploded. Hence Robert Prutz could say of this same proposition
          that by it all doubt was removed, the old God of darkness hurled into the abyss, and a
          new, eternally reigning Zeus, the idea that comprehends itself, man as a thinking being,
          raised to the throne.[1]</p>

        <p><pb n="15"/> The interpretations of Hegel's philosophy that soon appeared were many and
          widely different, but the kinship between his doctrines and Goethe's poetry was felt by
          all the initiated. Hegel became the strongest ally of the little circle of Goethe votaries
          in Berlin, and the two men, known as the absolute poet and the absolute philosopher, were
          the objects of a common veneration. The orthodox Hegelian even saw a significant
          coincidence in the circumstance that Hegel was born on the 27th of August and Goethe on
          the 28th. In the Twenties, the faithful gathered round the festive board on the evening of
          the 27th of August, drank the toast of the master in the kingdom of thought, and called to
          mind the saying in the preface to the _Philosophy of Right_ about the owl of Minerva,
          which begins its flight only when the shades of night are gathering. "But as soon as the
          midnight hour had struck, an orator rose to proclaim the glad tidings that Apollo, the God
          of day and of song, was now in his sun-chariot, ushering in the 28th, the glorious
          day."[2]</p>

        <p>The patriotism which in 1813 had driven the enemy out of the country, contained two
          radically different elements, a historical, retrospective tendency, which soon developed
          into Romanticism, and a liberal-minded, progressive tendency, which developed into the new
          Liberalism. When the reaction came, it sought support in many of the theories of
          Romanticism, and finally took the whole movement into its pay. Men like Görres, Friedrich
          Schlegel, and others, passed from the camp of Romanticism into that of reaction.</p>

        <p>The freedom-loving group had, of course, during the wars with Napoleon, shared the
          Romanticists' hatred of France. But when their sympathies came to take the shape of wishes
          and demands (for liberty of the press, constitutional government, the franchise, &amp;c),
          the hatred of France inevitably evaporated. And the stronger the reaction became, the more
          keenly were all eyes turned to that neighbouring country which possessed Parliamentary
          government. The heroes of French Liberalism were soon men of great consequence in the
          estimation of the German Liberals; indeed <pb n="16"/> at a distance they seemed of more
          consequence than they did at home. In Germany, after the victory over Napoleon, as after
          the great defeat, quietness was the first duty of the citizen.[3] All was obedience and
          silence. And the result was what it usually is when a highly gifted but unenergetic people
          are incapable of throwing off a yoke; its pressure generated self-contempt, and the
          self-contempt a kind of desperate wit, of chronic "gallows-humour"; the better sort
          developed a real passion for solacing themselves with derision of their own impotence. The
          observation of existing conditions gave constantly recurring occasion for irony directed
          against themselves--against visionary Romanticism, the spirit of patience and submission
          in the domain of politics, orthodoxy and pietism in the domain of religion.
          Caricature-like developments of political life, religion, and poetry incited to sarcasm,
          that sometimes ruthlessly wounded patriotic feeling, sometimes assumed a frivolous tone
          which, taken in connection with the French leanings of Liberalism, was, or inevitably
          seemed to be, more French than German.</p>

        <p>SPIRIT OF THE OPPOSITION</p>

        <p>The most notable of the freedom-loving poets and prose authors of the period are
          embodiments of some of the shades of opinion which have been alluded to. Adalbert von
          Chamisso, who, by virtue of his famous prose tale, _Peter Schlemihl_, and certain of his
          qualities, belongs to the German Romantic School, while in other respects he approaches
          more nearly to the French ideal of thought and writing, is, in some of his most
          characteristic poems, and even in his epigrams, a mouthpiece of the grief of the better
          sort over the steadily growing political and social reaction. As early as 1822, in his
          poem, _Die goldene Zeit_ ("The Golden Age"), he ridicules an age in which that man is a
          Jacobin who has openly expressed his belief that 2 and 2 make 4; in the _Nachtwächterlied_
          ("Watchman's Song") he scoffs at the power of the Jesuits; in _Joshua_ and _Das Dampfross_
          ("The Steam Horse"), at those who have robbed time of its secret, and learned how to force
          it backwards day by day; in _Das Gebet der Wittwe_ ("The Widow's Prayer") he gives a
          darkly pessimistic picture of the heartless rule of the powers that be, with its complete
          indifference to the fate of the common people; finally he sums up his view of the times in
          this bitterly humorous quatrain, which greets us sadly in the form of a four-part
          catch:</p>

        <p> KANON. "Das ist die Noth der schweren Zeit! Das ist die schwere Zeit der Noth! Das ist
          die schwere Noth der Zeit! Das ist die Zeit der schweren Noth!"[1]</p>

        <p><pb n="18"/> Count August von Platen-Hallermünde, whose youthful efforts were Romantic,
          both in their choice of subject and in their imitation of the forms of the Spanish drama,
          afterwards waged systematic war with Romanticism. Its latest developments in Germany he
          holds up to ridicule, without possessing enough of critical tact to discriminate between
          the authors who did and those who did not belong to the Romanticist group. He quits the
          literary drama to cultivate the political lyric muse, as he gradually arrives at the
          conviction that the pitiable condition of public affairs is also at the bottom of the
          German people's lack of appreciation of power and style and form in poetry. He finds life
          in Germany impossible to endure, and seeks, under the sunny skies of Sicily, amidst its
          reminiscences of antiquity, to forget the heavy atmosphere and the political abuses of his
          Northern home. But he cannot completely distract his thoughts from the ignominy there. He
          writes his Berlin national song, which begins with the chorus:</p>

        <p> "Diesen Kuss den Moscoviten, Deren Nasen sind so schmuck; Rom mit seinen Jesuiten Nehme
          diesen Händedruck!"[2]</p>

        <p>We find also the following bitter outburst of national self-contempt, written in wrath
          over the maltreatment of his poems by the censor:</p>

        <p> "Doch gieb, o Dichter, dich zufrieden, Es büsst die Welt nur wenig ein; Du weisst es
          längst, man kann hienieden Nichts Schlechtres als ein Deutscher sein."[3]</p>

        <p>Romantically as Platen's adversary, Heinrich Heine, starts, the modern spirit soon makes
          itself perceptible in his prose. Even before he touches on the subject of politics proper,
          he amuses himself, in his _Reisebilder_, by making taunting allusions to German conditions
          and to the way in which German stolidity accommodates itself to them.</p>

        <p><pb n="19"/> And the love of liberty, abstract, political liberty, was all along the true
          passion of Ludwig Börne, who long appeared to occupy himself with purely æsthetic matters,
          being known for whole decades only as a dramatic critic and writer of short stories.</p>

        <p>That these authors found readers and admirers bears witness to the fact that the thinking
          part of the German people at the end of the Twenties was laying aside its faith in
          authority in the domain of politics as well as in general intellectual matters. At this
          time the persecution of the students' unions (Burschenschaften) was being carried on with
          the utmost ardour. They were broken up everywhere. But they formed again at once, and in
          one German State, Bavaria, after the accession of King Ludwig, they were actually
          sanctioned by the police. The divisions that occurred among them show the directions of
          the various currents of public opinion at that time. In Erlangen, after 1827, there were
          three unions, at feud with each other--Teutonia, Arminia, and Germania.</p>

        <p>Teutonia was the organ of pure Romanticism, of religious mysticism, and declared that
          politics in no way concerned it. Arminia's principles were strict morality and the pursuit
          of science; it aimed at the reformation of the conditions of public life, and also at the
          unity and liberty of Germany. Germania answered to the Radical tendencies of the day. It
          dropped the older _Tugendbund's_ requirement of strict morality, emancipated itself from
          the rule of authority, including authority in the matter of religion, and declared the
          belief that its aim--which in the case of this union also was the unity and liberty of
          Germany--could only be attained by revolution. Though it was essentially a political
          organisation, it would be ridiculous to call it an important and dangerous one.</p>

        <p>These three main movements were soon represented at all the German universities, and
          significantly enough, it was, as a rule, the one represented by Germania, which had the
          greatest influence.</p>

        <p>INFLUENCE OF THE REVOLUTION OF JULY</p>

        <p>In 1830, while things were in this state of stagnation, oppression, and ferment, the news
          of the Paris Revolution of July arrived, and acted upon public feeling in Germany like an
          electric shock. All eyes were turned towards Paris, and among thinking people real
          enthusiasm was felt.</p>

        <p>The effect was perhaps most plainly observable among the quite young men.</p>

        <p>Two months before the Revolution, Karl Gutzkow, then nineteen, had, as he himself has
          told us, no understanding whatever of European politics. He neither knew who Polignac was,
          nor what it meant to violate _la Charte_ (the French constitution). He only knew that in
          spite of all the persecution of the German student unions (Burschenschaften), they were
          still alive, and that the object to be attained was the unification of Germany. If he
          thought at all of upheavals which might hasten the march of events, he looked for them
          rather from the direction of Erlangen or Jena than from Paris; at the utmost he conceived
          it possible that a troop of returning Philhellenes landing armed at Stralsund, might take
          forcible possession of the town and call the Pomeranian militia (Landwehr) to arms, and
          that the peasants, driven to it perhaps by famine, might join in the revolt.</p>

        <p>At this time the French author, Saint-Marc Girardin, had come to Berlin to study the
          German language, the Prussian school system, and also the University theology as
          represented by Schleiermacher and Neander, and the Pietism emanating from Halle. As a
          contributor to the _Journal des Débats_, he received his newspaper regularly from Paris,
          and with the eager interest of the aspirant to office, followed the progress of the
          Opposition in France. Gutzkow gave <pb n="21"/> him a German lesson daily; they read one
          of Kotzebue's comedies, which the Frenchman preferred as practice to Goethe or Schiller,
          but they invariably drifted into political discussions. Gutzkow made no attempt to conceal
          from Saint-Marc Girardin the slight general significance he attached to the French
          constitutional struggle, openly ascribing a greater influence on the course of history to
          the student union in Jena than to the Chamber of Deputies in Paris. Girardin smilingly
          gave a polite answer. From time to time these conversations were interrupted by Eduard
          Gans, the famous Prussian professor, Hegel's most renowned disciple in the faculty of law,
          Varnhagen's and Heine's friend, who in fluent French joined in the political argument, and
          made a great impression on Girardin by his woolly black hair and his whiskers. Gutzkow,
          who had heard the fashionably dressed, subtle and sarcastic professor ridicule the student
          movement from his professorial chair, and laughingly confess that he too once on a day, on
          the banks of the Saale, had deliberated upon the best means of helping Germany to an
          imperial crown, entreated the French politician not to believe that the youth of Germany
          thought with Gans. "I am quite aware of it," answered Girardin, "you intend to liberate
          the world with Sanscrit."</p>

        <p>On the 3rd of August 1830, the king's birthday was celebrated with song and speech in the
          great hall of the Berlin University. The students stood crowded together in front of the
          barrier behind which sat professors, officials, and officers of high rank. The famous
          philologist Boekh was the orator, and from the gallery above his head songs were sung by
          the University choir, under the leadership of Music-Director Zelter, Goethe's
          correspondent. The Rector of the University, Professor Schmalz, with queue and sword, went
          from chair to chair, exchanging a few words with the most honoured guests. But Gans,
          excited and impatient, passed round letters from Friedrich von Raumer, who had just come
          from Paris. The Crown Prince, afterwards Frederick William IV., sat and smiled; but all
          knew that a few days ago in France a king had been dethroned. It was <pb n="22"/> as if
          the thunder of the barricade cannonade were booming through the festive hall. Boekh's
          speech on the subject of the fine arts did not succeed in arousing attention, and when
          Hegel read from the chair the names of the prizewinners of the year, no one except the
          medallists listened. Gutzkow did hear with one ear that he had taken the prize in the
          faculty of philosophy, but with the other he heard of a people that had deposed a king, of
          cannonades, of thousands fallen in the fight. He was oblivious to the congratulations
          offered him; he did not even open the case which contained the gold medal with the king's
          portrait; he had forgotten the hope of a professorship which he had connected with the
          thought of winning this medal; he stood dazed, thinking of Saint-Marc Girardin and his
          prophecies, and of what he himself had prophesied of the German Burschenschaft. Then he
          rushed off to a confectioner's shop in Unter den Linden, and for the first time in his
          life read a newspaper with avidity. He could hardly await the publication of the official
          gazette that evening; not because he was impatient to see his name in the list of
          medallists; all he wished was to know the state of matters in Paris, whether or not the
          barricades were still standing, whether France was to come forth from Lafayette's hands a
          republic or a monarchy. "Science lay behind me," he writes, "history before me."[1]</p>

        <p>And Gutzkow is a type of the youngest generation of the Germany of that day--the young
          men of twenty.</p>

        <p>Almost simultaneously with Karl Gutzkow's political awakening, there occurred a memorable
          misunderstanding in the study of the octogenarian Goethe. A visitor, greeted by the old
          man with exclamations of joy over the great event in Paris, at first believed that he
          meant the Days of July, and only gradually came to understand that he was talking of the
          decision of the scientific dispute between Cuvier and Saint-Hilaire in favour of the
          latter. This famous misunderstanding has long enough been regarded as only a symptom of
          Goethe's limitation in matters political; it is <pb n="23"/> but fair to point out that
          the anecdote is also an indication of the old sage's justifiable indifference to
          over-estimated political events. The scientific dispute was, by reason of the idea
          involved, and its transforming effect on the spiritual map of the world, a weightier
          matter than the French Revolution of July. Does not Saint-Hilaire's theory of the unity of
          "plan" herald _The Origin of Species!_ But the picture of the overwhelming effect of the
          French political catastrophe on the youngest generation stands out all the sharper against
          the background of Goethe's impassibility.[2]</p>

        <p>The impression made on eminent individuals belonging neither to the youngest nor the
          oldest generation was very deep.</p>

        <p>The most intellectual and open-minded woman of the day, the most distinguished of
          Goethe's female admirers, Rahel, who by this time was sixty, was in entire sympathy with
          the Revolution. To her, as a woman, the social side was of more interest than the
          political. Saint-Simonism takes strong hold upon her; her marvellously youthful mind
          perceives its possibilities, and in the events of July she sees the beginning of the
          triumph of its social theories.</p>

        <p>To the reviving, inspiriting impression of the Revolution of July was now added another,
          which gave a sharp edge to the passionate political feeling of the younger generation--the
          impression, to wit, made by the outbreak of the Polish revolt. It is most plainly
          observable in the case of Platen, who in wild excitement addresses a poetical adjuration
          to the Crown Prince of Prussia (said to be the most favourably disposed) to take the part
          of unhappy Poland, and also writes the _Polenlieder_, the only poems of his that rise to
          the height of passion, proud songs of liberty, full of outspoken scorn of the autocrat who
          was worshipped at the German courts as an almighty being, and of those who allowed
          themselves to be bribed and bought with his roubles.</p>

        <p>On Ludwig Börne's mind the news of the Revolution of July acted with the effect of a
          flash of lightning.</p>

        <p>In the summer of 1830 he was at the watering-place of <pb n="24"/> Soden, near
          Frankfort-on-Main, recovering from a long bout of rheumatic fever and repeated attacks of
          hemorrhage. His _Journal_ shows that his political hopes were almost extinguished, his
          desires stifled. A soul like his, whose aspiration after liberty was a passion, whose
          hunger and thirst after righteousness consumed his vital force, was unable permanently to
          bear the heavy weight of political reaction.</p>

        <p>He was now forty-four, and since the time of the War of Liberation, that is to say as
          youth and grown man, had had experience of nothing but the triumphs of baseness and its
          persecution of all rectitude, all freedom of opinion. He had never been able to lift his
          eyes from the sheet of paper he was writing on, without seeing pallid fear of every great
          passion, of ideals, of youth itself, enthroned in high places, side by side with the
          animal instinct of self-preservation and animal self-indulgence--the Metternich and Gentz
          principle. He had given up none of the convictions of his youth and manhood, but the world
          to him was draped in mourning weeds. He had the feeling in Germany of sitting at the
          bottom of the sea, a diving-bell providing him with just enough air to keep him from
          suffocation. In Paris he had breathed fresh air. There the light of the sun, human voices,
          the sounds of life had enraptured him. Now, down among the fishes, he shivered with cold.
          He suffered the most terrible ennui. The stillness made him ill; the narrowness of
          everything galled him to the quick.</p>

        <p>He describes himself as one of those natures which cannot in the long run endure the
          "solo music" of existence. "Symphonies of Beethoven or thunder-storms" were a necessity to
          him. He was one of the people who feel themselves out of place in a box at the theatre,
          who sit from choice in the pit, in the middle of the crowd.</p>

        <p>It seemed to him as if in Germany the bullion of life were minted underground, in the
          silence of midnight, like counterfeiters' coin. Those who worked did not enjoy, and those
          who enjoyed, who in the light of day set the money in circulation that had been coined in
          fear and trembling in the darkness, did not work. In France a man of health and <pb n="25"
          /> spirit lived a life like that of a king's messenger, who is sent with despatches to
          foreign towns, never twice to the same place, and who on his long journeys sees and enjoys
          life in its most different developments; in Germany he lived like a postilion, who is
          always taking the same short journey back and forwards between two post-houses, receiving
          a miserable tip from fortune for his trouble. The postilion was perfectly able to take the
          journey in his sleep; he knew every stone on his ten miles of road; and this in Germany
          was called thoroughness; but Börne, sitting in the little hotel in Soden, watching the
          geese fighting in the yard, and studying the jealousy of the turkey-cocks and the coquetry
          of the turkey-hens, was not grateful for the opportunity of remarkable thoroughness
          afforded him.[3]</p>

        <p>When the news reached him that Polignac's ministry had issued the famous ordinances, had
          violated the constitution, he cried, anticipating all the consequences of this step: "And
          God said, let there be light!"</p>

        <p>The news of the Revolution of July followed. Every day he awaited the hour of the arrival
          of the newspaper with impatience; he walked out the country road, on the lookout for the
          mail; if it delayed too long, he went all the way to Höchst, where the papers came from.
          Soon he felt unable to remain in Soden. He returned to Frankfort, and astonished,
          electrified his environment by his fire. The silent, invalid-looking Börne was
          unrecognisable; a miracle seemed to have happened; he was young and strong again. All his
          old dreams seemed to have become realities, and everything in him that he had been
          forcibly keeping down sprang up again like a spring when pressure is removed.</p>

        <p>Frankfort did not long satisfy him; presently we hear of him in Paris.</p>

        <p>On the 7th of September he writes from Strasburg: "The first French cockade I saw was on
          the hat of a peasant who passed me in Kehl coming from Strasburg. It seemed to me like a
          little rainbow after the flood of our time, a sign of peace from a reconciled God. But
          when the bright tri-coloured flag greeted my eyes--oh! words <pb n="26"/> cannot express
          my emotion. My heart beat so violently that I was on the point of fainting.... The flag
          was on the middle of the bridge, its staff rooted in French ground, but part of the
          bunting waving in German air. Ask the first Secretary of Legation you meet if this is not
          a breach of international law. It was only the red stripe of the flag that fluttered over
          our native soil. And this is the one colour of French liberty that will be ours. Red,
          blood, blood--and alas! not blood shed on the battlefield."</p>

        <p>Börne is here only the mouthpiece of a feeling which had taken possession of most of the
          many in Germany who were susceptible of enthusiasm. The heroism shown by the French
          students, polytechnicians, and working men during _les trois jours glorieux_ was admired
          as much as in France itself, and doubly admired as the proof of an energy which the German
          people appeared to have lost. There was a universal inclination to drift into exaggerated
          contempt of their own want of political aptitude and insight, their own want of ability to
          act at the decisive moment.</p>

        <p>Thus powerfully did events act upon characters like Börne, and upon the enthusiasts who
          were to be found in greatest numbers in the scholarly class. Let us complete the picture
          by observing their effect on the men of the reaction.</p>

        <p>Gentz, who had at first exulted over Charles X.'s energy, grew anxious as the _coup
          d'état_ approached. "I look upon the ordinance against newspapers and books," he writes,
          "as a tremendous venture, of the success of which I am as yet by no means assured.... Such
          weapons ought to be played with only by people who are sure of their strength and of the
          means at their disposal. To venture into such regions means ruin for men like Polignac and
          Peyronnet."[4]</p>

        <p>As soon, however, as the first alarm had subsided, he and his spiritual kindred set to
          work to take advantage of every mistake made by the Liberals. Wisely turned to <pb n="27"
          /> account, the after-effects of the Revolution of July in Germany, by the occasion they
          gave for ruthless repression and persecution, censorship, and imprisonment, might lame the
          German Liberal movement for many a day; might (as Metternich said a few years later of the
          Hambach Festival) make the anniversary of the Revolution a day of rejoicing for the good
          instead of for the bad. And only a year later, Gentz, who at times had seen the future in
          a very dark light, was able to write: "Away with all gloomy forebodings now! We are not to
          die, Europe is not to die, and what we love is not to die. I am proud of never having
          despaired."[5]</p>

        <p>Metternich had enough literary taste to admire Börne, and Gentz was a fanatical Heine
          enthusiast. Before the Revolution of July it was still possible to look upon Heine as
          essentially the poet of unhappy love and the poetical humorist, with a touch of blasphemy
          and frivolity.</p>

        <p>In the summer of 1830 Heinrich Heine was at Heligoland, dreaming on the shore, gazing out
          to sea, listening to the plash of the waves. He had given up all hope of better times. He
          occupied himself with reading the few books he had taken with him--Homer, the Bible, the
          history of the Lombards, and some old volumes on witches and witchcraft. He could hardly
          himself believe that he had quite lately been the editor of the _Politische Annalen_ in
          Munich. Two days after the Revolution of July had taken place, but before the news of it
          had reached Heligoland, he wrote, in one of his letters from that island, that he had now
          determined to let politics and philosophy alone, and to devote himself entirely to the
          observation of nature and to art; that all this torture and trouble was to no purpose;
          that however great sacrifices he might make in the general cause, they would be of little
          or no avail; the world, doubtless, did not stand still, but it moved in a circle, with no
          result whatever; when he was young and inexperienced, he had believed that even if the
          individual perished in the war of <pb n="28"/> human liberation, the great cause would be
          victorious in the end; now he recognised the fact that humanity, like the ocean, moved
          according to fixed laws of ebb and flow.</p>

        <p>Even if these expressions have been strung together at a later period, even if the
          letters are not genuine, but a fragment of memoir inserted later, for the sake of
          contrast, in the book on Börne[6], they will undoubtedly give us a correct picture of
          Heine's mental attitude at that time.</p>

        <p>On the 6th of August he writes: "I was sitting reading Paul Warnefried's _History of the
          Lombards,_ when the thick packet of newspapers, with the warm, glowing-hot news, arrived
          from the mainland. Each item was a sunbeam, wrapped in printed paper, and together they
          kindled my soul into a wild glow. I felt as if I could set the whole ocean, to the very
          North Pole, on fire, with the red heat of enthusiasm and mad joy that glowed within me."
          It was all like a dream to him; the name Lafayette especially was like the echo of one of
          the stories of his earliest childhood; he could hardly believe that the man who had ridden
          in front of the grandfathers of the present generation in the American War of Independence
          was once more on horseback, the hero of the nation. He felt as if he must go to Paris and
          see it for himself.</p>

        <p>He writes with a passionate fervour, which he soon feels obliged to temper with a touch
          of self-contempt: "Lafayette, the tri-colour flag, the Marseillaise.... It intoxicates me.
          Bold, ardent hopes spring up, like trees with golden fruit and with branches that shoot up
          wildly, till their leaves touch the clouds.... My longing for rest is gone. I know once
          more what I desire, what I ought to, what I must, do.... I am the son of the Revolution,
          and again I take into my hand the charmed weapons, over which my mother spoke the magic
          spell.... Flowers, flowers! that I may crown my head for the death struggle. And the lyre,
          too; give me the lyre! that I may sing a song of battle.... Words like flaming stars, that
          shoot down from the sky, set palaces on fire, and illuminate huts.... Words like burnished
          javelins, that whirr up into the seventh heaven and <pb n="29"/> transfix the pious
          hypocrites who have insinuated themselves into the holy of holies.... I am all gladness
          and song, all sword and flame, and quite possibly mad."</p>

        <p>Among other things, he tells how the fisherman who some days later rowed him out to the
          sandbank from which they bathed, told him the news smilingly, with the words: "The poor
          people have won the victory." Heine expresses his astonishment at the correct instinct of
          the common man. And yet the exact opposite was the real state of matters; it was the rich
          people who in the end were and remained the victors.</p>

        <p>But an utterance such as the last quoted suffices to show the light in which German
          authors regarded the Revolution of July. It inspired in them the same religious emotion
          with which forty years previously the leading spirits of the Germany of that day had
          regarded the great Revolution. It was not to them the result of the strength of the
          Liberal bourgeoisie, and of their ability to persuade the lower classes to work and shed
          their blood for them; it was the general signal for the political, economical, and
          religious emancipation of humanity. It was the great deed that with one blow freed all
          nations from the yoke, all minds from oppression.</p>

        <p>In 1847 one of the foremost of the Radical writers of the Forties, Robert Prutz (at the
          time of the Revolution only fourteen), gave an excellent reproduction of the impression it
          created. "For fifteen years," he says, "it had seemed as if the eternal generative power
          of the world's history were paralysed. For fifteen years they had been building and
          cementing, holding congresses, forming alliances, spreading the net of police supervision
          over the whole of Europe, forging fetters, peopling prisons, erecting gallows--and three
          days had sufficed to overturn one throne, and make all the others tremble. It was not true
          then, after all, what the sovereigns had boasted, what the court romanticists had said and
          sung."[7] The millennial reign of the Holy Alliance had lasted fifteen years. It seemed as
          if a new spring must be at hand in the political and intellectual life of the German
          people.</p>

        <p>THE INFLUENCE OF BYRON</p>

        <p>The classical literature of Germany in the end of the eighteenth and the early years of
          the nineteenth century was in subject or form imitative of the antique; the Romantic
          literature which followed swore allegiance to the Middle Ages; both stood aloof from
          surrounding actualities, from the Now, from existing political or social conditions;
          neither directly aimed at producing any change in these. The ideal floated in the deep
          blue ether of Greece or in the Catholic sky of the Middle Ages. Now it was resolutely
          dragged down to earth. The modern ideal, an ideal which contains no mythic element,
          manifested itself to the dreamers and the workers. And with a haste, a violence, that too
          often made prose journalistic, poetry only lyric or quite fragmentary, the opposition
          poets and prose writers set to work to draw all modern life into the sphere of literature.
          From the fact of this inclusion, this appropriation, taking place when things were on a
          war footing, wit and satire became more prominent powers than they had ever been before in
          Germany; and the mood and inspiration of the "Sturm und Drang" period seemed to have
          revived, so far as aggressive defiance of the established was concerned. It was a strong
          craving for liberty that first induced Heine and Börne to strike out a new path in German
          literature, and afterwards inspired the writers who followed them, and were known by the
          vague name of "Young Germany."</p>

        <p>But there was one great man who, foreigner though he was, influenced German intellectual
          life by his personality, writings, and actions more than any of the famous men of the
          past. This was Lord Byron. It was long before men's eyes in Germany were opened to his
          artistic weaknesses and deficiencies. Gutzkow alone, about the year 1835, begins <pb
            n="31"/> to criticise him discerningly. But the Byron whom Goethe had admired and shown
          favour to (though principally because of that in him which the old master attributed to
          his own influence), Byron, with his contempt for the real negation of liberty that lay
          concealed beneath the "wars of liberty" against Napoleon, with his championship of the
          oppressed, his revolt against social custom, his sensuality and spleen, his passionate
          love of liberty in every domain, transfigured by his death as a liberator, seemed to the
          men of that day to be an embodiment of all that they understood by the modern spirit,
          modern poetry.</p>

        <p>Wilhelm Müller, the poet of the _Griechenlieder_, sings of him with fervent
          enthusiasm:</p>

        <p> "Siebenunddreissig Trauerschüsse? Und wen haben sie gemeint? Sind es siebenunddreissig
          Siege, die er abgekämpft dem Feind? Sind es siebenunddreissig Wunden, die der Held trägt
          auf der Brust? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Siebenunddreissig
          Jahre sind es, welche Hellas heut beweint! Sind' die Jahre, die du lebtest? Nein um diese
          wein ich nicht: Ewig leben diese Jahre in des Ruhmes Sonnenlicht, Auf des Liedes
          Adlerschwingen, die mit nimmer müdem Schlag Durch die Bahn der Zeiten rauschen, rauschend
          grosse Seelen wach. Nein, ich wein um andre Jahre, Jahre die du nicht gelebt, Um die
          Jahre, die für Hellas du zu leben hast gestrebt: Solche Jahre, Monde, Tage kündet mir des
          Donners Hall, Welche Lieder, welche Kämpfe, welche Wunden, welchen Fall! Einen Fall im
          Siegestaumel auf den Mauern von Byzanz, Eine Krone dir zu Füssen, auf dem Haupt der
          Freiheit Kranz!"[1]</p>

        <p>Byron's pride and his contempt for political slavery meet us again in Platen; his
          aristocratic tone, his antipathy to prejudice, his taste for travel, his love of animals
          and of nature, his charm and his irony, live again in Prince Pückler. <pb n="32"/> How
          enormously he influenced the formation of Heine's poetical ideal needs no insisting on, so
          forcibly does it strike every one who is familiar with the development of the modern
          literature of Europe. But it is both remarkable and instructive to observe the light in
          which he was looked upon by Börne, the first pioneer of the new German literary movement,
          a fundamentally different character from the English poet. One would naturally imagine
          that the vain, frivolous sides of Byron's personality would repel him, as these same
          qualities did in the case of Heine. Far from it. Note the expressions he employs in
          writing about him (_Briefe aus Paris_, No. 44) after reading Moore's _Life of Byron_. He
          calls the book wine that sends a glow of warmth through the poor German wayfarer,
          shivering on his journey through life. He feels almost ill with envy of such a life:</p>

        <p>"Like a comet that submits to no rules and regulations of the star community, Byron
          wandered through the world, wild and free; came without welcome, departed without
          farewell, preferring solitude to the thraldom of friendship. His feet never touched the
          dry earth; through storm and shipwreck he steered undauntedly onwards, and the first
          harbour he came to was the grave. Oh, how he was tossed about! But what islands of bliss
          did he not discover!... His was the kingly nature ... he is king who lives as he lists.
          When I hear people say that Byron only lived for thirty-seven years, I laugh; he lived for
          a thousand. And when they pity him because he was so melancholy! Is not God melancholy?
          Melancholy is God's gladness. Is it possible to be glad when one loves? Byron hated men
          because he loved mankind, hated life because he loved eternity. I would give all the joys
          of my life for a year of Byron's sorrows."</p>

        <p>We observe not only that Börne takes everything about Byron seriously, but that he is
          quite unconscious of the same self-indulgent temperament in Byron which repelled him so
          strongly in Goethe. And it is still more surprising that Börne should consider his own
          nature to be akin to Byron's. He writes:--</p>

        <p><pb n="33"/> "Perhaps you ask me in surprise how such a beggarly fellow as I come to
          compare myself with Byron; in which case I must tell you something that you do not know.
          When Byron's genius on his journey through the firmament first came to this earth, he
          stayed for a night with me. But the lodging was not to his mind; he left again at once,
          and took up his quarters at the Hotel Byron. I sorrowed over this for many a year, grieved
          over my insignificance, my failure. But that is past now; I have forgotten it, and live
          contented in my poverty. My misfortune is that I was born in the middle class, for which I
          am not suited."</p>

        <p>Words such as these bear striking witness to the magic power which the shade of Byron
          still exercised over the minds of the leaders of literature.</p>

        <p>[1] What mean these thirty-seven minute-guns? Do they tell of thirty-seven victories? of
          thirty-seven wounds on the hero's breast?... They are thirty-seven years, that Greece is
          mourning to-day. Are they the years of thy life? Nay, over these we do not mourn; these
          live for ever in the sunlight of fame, borne upon the eagle wings of song, whose tireless
          beat resounds down the ages, awakening great souls. 'Tis other years I weep, the years
          thou wouldst have lived for Greece. 'Tis of these years and months and days that the
          volley's thunder speaks to me. What songs, what struggles, what wounds, what a fall! A
          fall in the intoxicating moment of victory, on the walls of Byzantium, a crown at thy
          feet, on thy brow the wreath of liberty!</p>

        <p>VALUE OF THE NEW LITERATURE</p>

        <p>It was under the conditions and influences just described that the German opposition
          literature of 1820 to 1848 came into being. In surveying such a large group of
          intellectual productions, we naturally look upon them in the first instance as being,
          taken generally, a series of documents which inform us how the people of that country and
          that time thought and felt, what were the developments of their civilisation, what their
          hopes, their wishes, their philanthropy, their devotion to liberty, their sense of right,
          their ideal of good government, and, finally, what their taste was--that is to say, in
          what manner an author required to write who wished to be read and to awaken real
          interest.</p>

        <p>Our historical curiosity on these points being satisfied, there next involuntarily arises
          the question of the actual value of the literature. In the case of philosophical writings
          this question turns mainly upon the measure of new truth they contain; or if, as is too
          often necessary, we are obliged to regard them chiefly in the light of productions of the
          imagination, it turns upon the scope and suggestiveness of their hypotheses. In the case
          of poetry and fiction, and also to a certain extent in the case of the allied historical
          and descriptive writings, the question of their value is the same as the question of their
          beauty; for by beauty we mean artistic worth.</p>

        <p>It is a well-known fact that out of a very large number of authors only one or two
          continue to be read after the lapse of a few generations; out of an enormous number of
          works there is only one here and there that people continue to make their own. Of the
          writers of the period under consideration, very few are known and read to-day out of
          Germany; in Germany of course a considerably <pb n="35"/> greater number; still,
          comparatively few of the productions of that day are in the hands of the general reading
          public.</p>

        <p>The first rough criticism is thus the work of time; after the lapse of so many years,
          such and such an author does not sell, whilst another is perpetually coming out in new
          editions. But it is no absolute proof of the worth of a writer that he long continues to
          have a wide circle of readers. It does not prove that his place is among the best, only
          that he is among the most approachable, the most entertaining. A high degree of culture,
          or of refinement of mind, may stand in the way of a wide circulation, though they ensure
          lasting fame.</p>

        <p>At the present day, out of Germany, only two of the philosophical writers of that day,
          Feuerbach and Schopenhauer, are still read, the former little, the latter much; but it was
          at a later period that Schopenhauer began to influence men's minds, and both these
          thinkers are read less for the sake of their matter than for their original, daring style.
          Of the poets, only Heine is much and steadily read out of Germany. In Germany he is looked
          on and judged as the stinging-nettle in the garden of literature; he stings the
          historians' fingers and they curse him. In histories of literature and magazine articles
          his prose is described as old-fashioned and his poetry as artificial; yet his works, now
          that the copyright has expired, are republished in innumerable editions. Both in and out
          of Germany he is as much sung as read. His poems have given occasion to more than 3000
          musical compositions. In 1887 the solo-songs alone (leaving out of account the duets,
          quartettes and choruses) numbered 2,500. Hueffer has counted one hundred and sixty
          settings of "Du bist wie eine Blume," eighty-three each of "Ich hab' im Traum geweinet"
          and "Leise zieht durch mein Gemuth," seventy-six of "Ein Fichtenbaum steht einsam," and
          thirty-seven of "Ich weiss nicht was soll es bedeuten." Amongst these compositions are
          many of the most beautiful songs of Schubert, Mendelssohn, Schumann, Brahms, Robert Franz,
          and Rubinstein--very few of which the poet himself can have heard. Of all the German lyric
          poets Heine is the one whose songs have <pb n="36"/> been most frequently set to music.
          After him, with his 3000 compositions, comes Goethe, with about 1700; the others follow
          far behind.</p>

        <p>Out of Germany Heine's fame not merely lives unassailed, but is steadily growing and
          spreading. In France he occupies men's minds as if he were a contemporary. He is the only
          foreign poet whom Frenchmen regard as one of their own, one of their greatest. No other
          foreign author is so frequently mentioned in the French literature of our own day, and
          none is named with greater admiration, not even Shelley or Poe. Edmond de Goncourt makes
          use of the strong expression, that all modern French writers when compared with Heine
          remind him of commercial travellers; and Théophile Gautier said that the Philistines
          sought to drag the stones to build a pyramid above Heine's grave.</p>

        <p>A question that is constantly cropping up in one civilised society or another is: What
          works should be included in a library of the hundred best books? The answers of course
          vary very much. But in all Romanic and Slavonic countries, Heine's name is sure to be one
          of the first on the lists. On English lists there are usually ninety English books and ten
          foreign, but Heine's name is certain to be among the ten. The belief that it is possible
          to find a hundred books which would be the best reading for every one, a belief which has
          its origin in the Protestant notion of there being one such great book, is of course
          childish, and the question interesting only in so far as it shows what an entirely
          impersonal ideal of culture exists in the mind both of the questioner and of those who
          naïvely set themselves to answer his question. It is instructive, however, _à propos_ of
          Heine, to notice the results in certain specific cases. No small astonishment was
          expressed in Germany a few years ago, when a great number of English lists were published,
          and Heine was found in them all--a distinction shown to no other German author, for there
          were lists which contained no book by Goethe.</p>

        <p>This universal fame is not, however, founded on Heine's merits alone, but also on the
          fact that much of his writing demands only the very slightest amount of culture for its
            <pb n="37"/> comprehension, and of refinement of mind for its enjoyment; the latter
          quality being indeed rather a hindrance to the enjoyment of some of it. Still its main
          foundation is the fact that, after all, his talent was, in its way, the most eminent of
          that period.</p>

        <p>If, then, the value of a literary work of art is evidenced by its power of resistance to
          time, and its attraction for foreign readers, and yet these qualities form no proper
          criterion of its value, how are we to gauge it? By the originality and vigour of the
          spiritual life and of the emotion of which the work is an expression, together with its
          power of impressing these characteristics on the reader. All art is the expression of some
          emotion, and has for its object the production of emotions. The deeper a signet gem is
          cut, the sharper, the clearer are the outlines in wax. The deeper the impression in the
          soul of the artist, the clearer, the more forcible is its artistic expression. The
          emotions of the artist differ from those of other men only in this, that they leave in his
          memory that species of impression, which, when he reproduces it, infects listener or
          reader.</p>

        <p>The questions to which any work provides us with answers are such as the following: How
          far-sighted was the author? How deeply did he penetrate into the life of his time? How
          characteristically did he feel joy, or grief, or sadness, or love, or enthusiasm, or
          cynicism? We say: So great was the horror, or disgust, inspired in him by stupidity or
          wickedness; so sharply or wittily did he revenge himself and us on contemptible stupidity
          or worthlessness. From the best we receive an impression of high-mindedness or greatness,
          of love of truth or love of beauty; in the case of inferior men we suffer from deficiency
          in understanding, in depth of feeling, in sense of beauty, or in strength of
          character.</p>

        <p>Now the literary group under consideration includes no creative minds of the highest, and
          only one of very high rank, namely Heine. It bequeathed to posterity little that was
          tangibly great. It denied, it emancipated, it cleared up, it let in fresh air. It is
          strong through its doubt, its hatred of thraldom, its individualism.</p>

        <p><pb n="38"/> In Germany, especially in North Germany, it has never stood so low in
          general estimation as at the present day. Those writers who, about the year 1830, made war
          upon all the forms of tyranny which weighed upon the German-speaking peoples, have in our
          days been overtaken by an unpopularity which shows no signs of decrease.</p>

        <p>The explanation is simple. The younger generation of the Germany of to-day, which has the
          unification of the Empire behind it--that unification which to the men of 1830 was a
          fantastic hope--and which has seen Germany put forth its united strength in prompt,
          universally successful action, that generation takes little interest in the old dreamy
          speculations as to how the unification was to be brought about, and is bored by these old
          writers' everlasting ridicule of German sleepiness and inactivity, German pedantry and
          theorising, now that results have shown how practical and how resolute the flouted Germany
          could be when an opportunity was offered her.</p>

        <p>More especially since the Franco-German war, the writers who half a century ago were
          always praising France at the expense of Germany, or maintaining that liberty would bring
          to Germany those blessings which actually came to her through Bismarck, have been placed
          under a sort of ban. They are looked on as bad patriots and foolish prophets. Only a small
          minority are able to perceive how powerfully that very indignation, that scorn for the
          contemptible existing conditions, helped to bring on the change and improvement that
          followed. And still fewer in number are those who read in the literature of the Thirties
          and Forties a living reproach for betrayed or forgotten ideals, and who, as they turn over
          the leaves of these old books, ask themselves sadly what, in the new order of things, has
          become of the best that these men fought for.</p>

        <p>BÖRNE</p>

        <p>Of the authors who in those days stood in the foremost rank, Ludwig Börne is now almost
          the most neglected. The subjects on which he wrote are obsolete, and none but those
          interested in the personality of the writer read his short prose pieces in the form of
          newspaper articles or letters, for the sake of the style, or of the spirit in which the
          subject is treated. It was in the later years of his life that Börne first really made a
          name for himself by his _Letters from Paris_; and the abstract hatred of princes and the
          republican faith which find expression in these letters are entirely out of place in the
          young Empire of to-day. No personality could be more utterly out of keeping with the new
          order of things. Where the idea of the State is by slow degrees becoming all-powerful:
          where, from above, despotically socialistic, it seeks to restrict initiative, transforms
          as many citizens as possible into paid officials, and gives the paid official precedence
          of the simple citizen, and from below, revolutionarily socialistic, strives with all its
          might to restrict individual freedom of action: there markedly self-reliant characters
          inevitably disappear, and the rugged, independent individuality seems something illegal,
          something which no one can accept as a model of culture. Börne's was just such an angular
          individuality and perfectly independent character.</p>

        <p>[Illustration: LUDWIG BÖRNE]</p>

        <p>In the German middle-class of to-day, speaking generally, the only task that seems worthy
          of a man is to build up, to forward, to strengthen or remould the already acquired. The
          iconoclastic tendency of Börne's mind at once alarms. The fire which warmed his age and
          generation is to the new generation that of a Don Quixote who charges with his lance at
          fortress and castle walls. And yet Börne, too, had a hand in the production of the iron
          architecture of the new <pb n="40"/> Iron Age of Germany. His fire melted the ore out of
          which the new pillars of society have been cast.</p>

        <p>Perhaps nothing has injured Börne more in the estimation of the present generation than
          his violently prejudiced denunciation of Goethe. Goethe, as productive and intelligent
          spirit, is so great, and his temperament and personality are so unique, that in our own
          day a man's judgment of him gives a valuable clue to that man's mind and character. And
          although in those days there were quite a number of writers, not only belonging to the
          clerical party, but also among the opposition, who detested Goethe, there can be no doubt
          that Börne gave clear proof of narrow-mindedness by the manner in which he wrote of the
          venerable old man in Weimar, by the nature of his protests against the general belief in
          Goethe's greatness as a man and as a poet.</p>

        <p>But in order to understand how it came about and what it signified that a revolutionary
          political moralist like Börne entertained a feeling of positive hatred and of lasting and
          lively resentment towards the greatest genius in all German literature, it is necessary
          that we should understand how, from his very birth, Börne's fate placed him in a position
          of antagonism to the great man whom he was driven to judge by an alien and therefore a
          false standard.</p>

        <p>Goethe and Börne were natives of the same town, born, one thirty-seven years after the
          other, in Frankfort-on-Main. Frankfort was an old imperial fortified city, with gates and
          towers which indicated the boundaries of the town in earlier days, and an outer circle of
          gates, towers, walls, bridges, ramparts and moats round the new town. It was a fortified
          place enclosing smaller fortifications in the shape of monastic buildings and castle-like
          mansions. There was something unalterable about the town, which was surrounded by a sort
          of halo of ancient, venerable independence. It was a patrician republic, in which a
          stranger was practically without the pale of the law. Woe to him if he engaged in a
          law-suit with a Frankfort citizen in a Frankfort court of justice, though it might be
          clear as noon-day that he was in the right! The ruling families formed an exclusive
          coterie, and their social inter<pb n="41"/>course was marked by much old-fashioned
          ceremony. No one dreamed of the possibility of tampering with any of the old political or
          social institutions of the city. The authorities had no spirit of enterprise, the
          inhabitants no feeling that change of any kind was possible. Such a thing as political
          cohesion with the rest of Germany was unthought of. In the Germany of that day each town,
          and in the town each quarter, was a little world by itself.</p>

        <p>Goethe was a young patrician. His father was an Imperial Councillor (_kaiserlicher
          Rath_). As soon as the young man had acquired a thorough knowledge and understanding of
          his native town, it must have seemed to him that fate could not possibly have any other
          lot in store for him but that of a prosperous Frankfort citizen. For the town enthralled
          him; its best families took possession of the handsome, gifted youth, their women made
          much of him, their tradition bound him. There was nothing to attract him to the larger
          towns, Vienna or Berlin, which were then practically as far from Frankfort as Rome and St.
          Petersburg are in our days. Fate appeared to have destined him to become in due time a
          lawyer, paterfamilias, public official, house-owner, and literary notability in his native
          town.[1]</p>

        <p>Goethe's actual evasion of this fate was, as every one knows, mainly due to the fact
          which calls down Börne's wrath upon him, that he became the retainer of a prince, that the
          Duke of Weimar gave him an important appointment at his little court.</p>

        <p>Börne, too, was born in Frankfort-on-Main, but in the Jews' quarter. In his day it was a
          misfortune to be born a Jew in Germany; for there, as elsewhere, the Jews had none of the
          rights of citizens. But it was a special misfortune to be born a Jew in Frankfort-on-Main.
          In other large towns, the position which Jews by this time took in society to a certain
          extent counterbalanced their political disqualifications. Both in Vienna and Berlin many
          Jewish houses were frequented as centres of liberal-minded culture and brilliant wit.
          Jewesses of <pb n="42"/> genius like Rahel, charming Jewesses like Henriette Herz,
          Baroness Grotthuis, Baroness Arnstein, the Prince of Reuss's consort, and many others,
          were soon to become leaders of society in the capitals of Prussia and Austria. But in
          Frankfort, in every walk of life, the barrier between the religions was an impassable
          one.</p>

        <p>All Jews were compelled to live in the narrow, mean, over-populated Judengasse, which was
          their only place of abode for 334 years, from 1462 onwards. The contrast we read of in
          novels between the outward meanness and inward splendour of the Ghettos did not exist
          here; the interiors of the houses corresponded to their exteriors; in the small, dark
          rooms no display of splendour or of taste was possible. A few years ago we had the best of
          all opportunities of judging of the kind of life the inhabitants of the Judengasse must
          have lived. One side of the street was pulled down, and a single stunted row of deformed,
          hunchbacked, cramped, startled-looking houses, in which great gaps had already been made
          by the axe of the leveller, was exposed to the full light of day, from which their little
          blinking bull's-eye windows gave them the appearance of shrinking.</p>

        <p>As soon as it began to grow dark, all the inhabitants of the Ghetto were locked in. When
          they walked through the streets or round the ramparts in the day-time, they dared not set
          foot on the pavement or foot-paths, but had to keep to the middle of the road. They were
          obliged to take off their hats and make a low bow to every passer-by who called: "Mach
          mores, Jud'!" In order to prevent their too rapid increase, only fourteen couples were
          permitted to marry each year. Although even at that time a large proportion of the
          Frankfort Jews, with Rothschild at their head, were wealthy, a strong society barrier
          existed between the religions. They were even separated in the Masonic Lodges, which are
          consecrated to "brotherly love" and the worship of "the highest Being."</p>

        <p>It is clear that such a condition of things must have had a strong influence on a
          receptive young mind.</p>

        <p>On the 6th of May 1786, in house No. 118 of that <pb n="43"/> Judengasse which has now
          disappeared, there was born to the "Jew merchant Jakob Baruch" a third son, the same who
          in 1818, shortly before his baptism, exchanged the name Juda Low Baruch, given him at his
          birth, for that of Ludwig Börne. The family stood in very high estimation. Börne's
          grandfather was a rich and remarkably benevolent man. He built and fitted up a synagogue
          for the community at his own expense. He was the business agent at Neckarsulm of the
          Teutonic Order, and was thence transferred, on account of his ability and honesty, to
          Mergentheim, the headquarters of the Order, where he took up his residence. An Electorship
          becoming vacant, he did such good service, in the course of the election, to the House of
          Hapsburg, that Maria Theresa with her own hand signed a document promising all sorts of
          privileges to him and his descendants if they should at any time take up their abode in
          Austria.</p>

        <p>This man's son, Jakob Baruch, inherited, it seems, his father's ability and sagacity
          without his orthodox religious faith. He was a clever man of business, with considerable
          diplomatic talent, much esteemed at courts and by high officials for his knowledge of
          human nature, his clearsightedness and coolness; a cold, prudent man, to whom life had
          taught the lesson that the best thing those in his position could do was to live quietly
          and thus avoid exciting hatred. He held enlightened opinions on religious subjects, and
          the wearisome Jewish ceremonial, which, chiefly for his father's sake, he felt obliged to
          observe with all his household, was a burden to him personally. It was not till late in
          life that he tried to emancipate himself. Being a rich man's son, he had received a fair
          education; it is said that he was at the same school in Bonn as Prince Metternich; but his
          cautiousness led him to give strict orders to his own son's one tutor to confine himself
          to the old Jewish course of instruction--the Bible, the prayer-book, and the Talmud.</p>

        <p>The boy was quiet and shy. As he was the one of her children his mother cared least for,
          and was constantly in disgrace with the tyrannical old servant, his home-life was one of
          severe discipline, his father too, no doubt with the <pb n="44"/> best of intentions,
          checking every manifestation of independence in thought or action. One result of this was,
          that when he first came into contact with the outer world, his emotions blunted, his
          intellect doubly keen, he looked at everything from the purely intellectual point of view.
          A thing was stupid or not stupid, and that was all.[2]</p>

        <p>The religious observances of his home and of the synagogue aroused in the boy a feeling
          of aversion as dead ritual; the religious instruction he received at home made as little
          impression on him as his attendance at the synagogue. Certain prayers, as, for instance,
          the prayer for the reinstitution of sacrificial worship, displeased him, in spite of his
          boyish orthodoxy. To the horror of those about him, he said: "That is a stupid
          prayer."</p>

        <p>His learning was mere committing to memory, his teacher not believing himself what he
          taught; and it was all quickly forgotten. As a grown man, he did not know a single word of
          Hebrew, had no understanding whatever of Jewish customs, and no affection even for the Old
          Testament, of which Heine was such an enthusiastic admirer. The man who himself reminds us
          of an Old Testament prophet, has not one allusion to the prophets in all his writings.
          From time to time, indeed, with complete indifference, and merely as a well-known
          illustration, he refers to some Bible narratives; but as Steinthal acutely observes, he
          quotes even such a passage as Samuel's republican warning against the establishment of a
          kingdom, which one would expect to excite his every sympathy, as if he were quoting one of
          Æsop's fables.[3]</p>

        <p>Schiller's essay, _The Mission of Moses_, was the first hint of a rational conception of
          religion that reached the boy. It made a deep impression on him, and shook his faith.
          Naïvely simple as the essay is, with its implicit trust in the historic accuracy of the
          Bible narrative, it yet inevitably produced a revolution in the mind of the youthful
          reader, who now for the first time saw the most important <pb n="45"/> events in the life
          of his people and of their lawgiver divested of every miraculous element, Providence
          itself being superseded by "destiny."</p>

        <p>Various anecdotes exist, illustrating the awakening of the spirit of criticism in the
          boy, and the play of the different forces which formed his character. One day, when it was
          raining heavily and the road was inch-deep in mud, he was walking with his tutor outside
          the gates of the town. "Let us walk on the footpath," said Börne. "Do you not know,"
          answered the teacher, "that we are forbidden to do that?" The boy's reply, "no one sees
          us," gave the tutor an opportunity for a moral exhortation, with remarks on the sacredness
          of law. "That is a stupid law," said Börne.</p>

        <p>The tutor was careful to avoid occasions of exciting bitterness in the child. But there
          were so many. No Jew was allowed to be present at any open-air public amusements, not even
          at a balloon ascent. On all festive occasions, as, for instance, when the town was
          decorated for the reception of royal guests, the Jews were shut up in the Judengasse; on
          the day of the coronation of Leopold II. some of their leading men ventured out, but were
          at once arrested and taken to the guard-house. They were prohibited from entering most of
          the hotels, and from setting foot in any public grounds or open spaces. The general rule
          was: Where there is green grass, no Jew must be seen. On Sundays the gates of the
          Judengasse were locked at four o'clock in the afternoon, and the sentry allowed no one to
          pass out except persons taking letters to the post-house or going for medicine to the
          apothecary's. Little Börne used to say: "I only don't go out because the sentry is
          stronger than I am." Yet when the boy, who early showed signs of a distinctly benevolent
          disposition, was accosted one day by two beggars, the one a Jew, the other a Christian, it
          was to the latter he gave all the money he had in his pocket. "Why do you not give the
          preference to one of your own people?" asked the tutor. "Because it is written in the
          Proverbs of Solomon that we are to heap coals of fire on our enemies' heads." The
          conscientious tutor would not hear of this reason: "it was based on <pb n="46"/> the false
          assumption that the Christians are the enemies of the Jews."</p>

        <p>It is easy to understand that such impressions, received in childhood, must have caused
          Börne's ancestry to weigh more upon his mind than it would have done under normal
          conditions. And even if he could have forgotten it, the frequent humiliations experienced
          in his youth, and in later years the perpetual allusions to his nationality made both by
          his opponents and his champions, would have constantly reminded him of it. With reference
          to these perpetual allusions he writes in _Briefe aus Paris_ (Feb. 7, 1832): "It is like a
          miracle! The thing is always happening, and yet is always new to me. One set of people
          reproach me with being a Jew; another set forgive me for it; a third go the length of
          praising me for it; but they one and all think of it. It is as if they had been conjured
          into this magic Jewish circle; none of them can get clear of it. And I know quite well
          what is the evil spell. These poor Germans! They live in the basement, weighed down by
          seven stories of higher ranks, and it eases their perturbed minds to talk of human beings
          who live even lower down than they do, right down in the cellar. The fact that they are
          not Jews consoles them for not even being court-councillors (_Hofräthe_)."</p>

        <p>It cannot, however, be asserted that Börne was peculiarly sensitive on the subject of his
          Jewish extraction. He often declaimed with the greatest indignation against the oppression
          of the unfortunate inhabitants of the Ghettos, but he could not do what many expected of
          him, could not advocate the emancipation of the Jews with greater warmth than other
          kindred causes. A pursuit of liberty with only that end in view he looked upon as
          one-sided and egoistic.</p>

        <p>Moreover, the Jews inspired him with a feeling of dissatisfaction, of aversion,
          originating in the antipathy which Frankfort commerce, consisting chiefly in banking
          business, early awoke in the born poet and idealist. It horrified him to hear a Frankfort
          merchant speak with the same enthusiasm and ardour of Rothschild or the Austrian loan,
          with which "a lover of art would speak of a Raphael." In 1822 he wrote: "My aversion from
          traders and Jews, as such, has <pb n="47"/> reached a climax, now that I have got away
          from Frankfort, and see what it really means to enjoy life." Börne was by no means
          incapable of appreciating great commercial undertakings from the æsthetic as well as the
          practical point of view. Not many years later, the exchange and the harbour of Hamburg
          excite his lively admiration. But the Frankfort merchants, Rothschild among them, appeared
          to him, with their speculations in government stock, to be connected with what he abhorred
          above everything--the dismembered state of Germany and the Metternichian principles. His
          writings abound in thrusts at "the ennobled German Jews, who are on terms of the most
          familiar intimacy with all the ministers and royal mistresses," and in consequence look
          with complete indifference on the Poles' struggle for liberty. Rothschild especially is to
          him the symbol of evil: "The government could not be more despicable if Rothschild the Jew
          were king, and had formed a ministry of bill-brokers.... Rothschild will stand till the
          last day of kings. What a day of reckoning! what a crash!" In his bitter hatred of him he
          goes so far as to call it a disgrace to the Jewish nation when Rothschild is sentenced in
          Paris to two days' imprisonment for declining, in spite of repeated warnings, to have his
          cabriolet numbered. Börne had, of course, no personal enmity to the man, but he detests
          him as "the great broker of all those State loans which give monarchs the power to defy
          liberty." Being firmly persuaded, after the Revolution of July, that another great
          revolution was close at hand, he mistakenly considers it stupid of the Jews to curry
          favour with those in power throughout Europe. But he is right when he calls them "stupider
          than cattle" for imagining that in the event of a threatening revolution they will be
          protected by the governments.</p>

        <p>With sound political judgment he perceives, what events in Russia have confirmed, that it
          is exactly at such a time that those in power will deliver them up to the tender mercies
          of popular hatred in order to escape themselves.[4]</p>

        <p>The fact of Börne's being born without the pale of <pb n="48"/> Christian society did not
          produce in him any excessive sympathy with his co-religionists; but the severe discipline
          of his joyless childhood, the coldness of his parents, the aversion aroused in him by the
          cupidity, cowardly caution, and other vices generated by oppression which he observed in
          those around him, all contributed to forge a spirit that could never be bent, softened, or
          broken--a character on whose adamantine firmness neither flattery nor threats made the
          smallest impression. The severity of this character of ermine-white purity, a severity
          born of the burning love of justice, at times clad itself in the garment of humorous
          irony, at times in that of scathing ire. As a writer Börne was for Germany much what Paul
          Louis Courier was for France, that is to say, a political tribune, as satirical and as
          liberty-loving as the Frenchman, less clear-sighted in matters of the day, but with more
          feeling, more imagination, an all-round richer nature.[5]</p>

        <p>For in Börne's case firmness of character did not preclude gentleness of disposition. The
          weak, always rather sickly boy, who grew up in a sunless street, shut off from fresh air
          and from nature, was tender-hearted. The germ of tenderness in his nature was perhaps
          first developed by reading that German author who exercised most influence on the
          formation of his opinions and his style--Jean Paul. It is from Jean Paul, his best
          comforter in the dark days of his youth, that Börne, the author, is directly
          descended.</p>

        <p>To him Jean Paul was the poet of those who are born in obscurity. He loved him as the
          spokesman of those who suffer wrong. He saw in him a priest of justice, an apostle of
          mercy. His famous commemorative oration gives us some idea of his youthful enthusiasm, and
          at the same time shows what it was in Jean Paul's style that he endeavoured to make his
          own. Real emotion makes itself felt through the artificial antitheses in such a passage as
          this:--</p>

        <p>"We will sorrow for him whom we have lost, and for those who have not lost him. For he
          did not live for all. But the time is coming when he will be born for all, and then all
          will mourn for him. He stands with a patient <pb n="49"/> smile at the gates of the
          twentieth century, waiting till his lagging people overtake him. Then he will lead the
          tired and the famishing into his city of love."</p>

        <p>And there is clever character-drawing in such lines as the following:--</p>

        <p>"In countries the towns only are counted; in towns, only the towers, the temples, and the
          palaces; in houses, their masters; in nations, parties; and in parties, their leaders....
          By narrow, overgrown paths Jean Paul sought out the neglected village. In the nation he
          counted the human beings, in towns the house-roofs, and under every roof each heart."</p>

        <p>It was possibly Jean Paul's political attitude which first brought Börne under his spell.
          Jean Paul early took his place in German literature as the inheritor of Herder's
          cosmopolitan sentiments and doctrines. Herder had persistently exalted love of humanity,
          at the expense of patriotism and national antipathy. Jean Paul continued to proclaim the
          common brotherhood of man. All his writings were, moreover, pervaded by a general spirit
          of political liberalism, resembling that formulated in the Declaration of the Rights of
          Man, which had electrified him; and he treats of sovereigns, courts, and the great world
          generally, in a tone of sustained irony. At times he regards as close at hand a coming
          golden age, in which it will no longer be possible for nations, but only for individuals,
          to sin, and from which the spectre of war shall have disappeared; at other times he
          relegates it to a very far off future; but the rapidity of what was and is called
          _historic progress_ induced both him and his disciple to imagine that universal
          brotherhood was not very distant.</p>

        <p>It was, however, not only his grand conception of the future that made Jean Paul so
          attractive to Börne, but also the idyllic and satiric qualities of his talent. Börne
          adopted some of his comical names of places (_Kuhschnappel Flachsenfingen_), and as a
          young man imitated his humorous style. Many of the short tales and sketches contributed to
          periodical literature--the comic _Esskünstler am Hoteltisch, Allerhochstdieselben, Hof-
          und Commerzienräthe, Die Thurn und Taxissche <pb n="50"/> Post_ (the postal system of the
          day), &amp;c. &amp;c.--are in Jean Paul's manner, though Börne keeps closer to reality
          both in his facts and his local colouring than Jean Paul does. Börne attacks State,
          Church, executive, manners, and customs in Jean Pauls farcical fashion; but he has not his
          predecessor's stores of observation to fall back on, and does not approach him in variety
          of knowledge.</p>

        <p>By way of compensation, his style is in many ways superior to Jean Paul's.</p>

        <p>Börne, who was not gifted with any profound artistic feeling, or delicate appreciation of
          style, admired the inartistic in Jean Paul as being unartificial. He did not feel that the
          profusion of imagery was collected from here, there, and everywhere, and was seldom the
          natural outgrowth of the subject it adorned. That Oriental wealth of simile, that flowery
          luxuriance of language, pleased his taste as being poetical; and the want of harmony in
          the periods, the heavy ballast of the innumerable parenthetic clauses, were to his ear
          only evidences of the naturalness of the style. To him, too, Goethe's plastic art was only
          coldness, while the impersonal style of Goethe's old age was a horror. When he read Jean
          Paul's works, the living, restless ego in them came forth to meet his own warm-hearted,
          passionate ego.</p>

        <p>He unconsciously remoulded Jean Paul's style on the lines of his own individuality, that
          individuality which discloses itself in his earliest letters, and whose distinguishing
          traits were modified or developed, but never altered. There were no wildernesses, no
          primeval forests in his mind, as there were in Jean Paul's. He did not think of ten things
          at a time, all inextricably entwined. No; in his case both fancy and reasoning-power were
          clear, and concise in expression. His acquaintance with Johannes von Müller's works early
          produced a propensity for pithy, Tacitus-like brevity. From the first there was a half
          French, half Jewish tendency to antitheses and contrast in his style. He loved symmetry of
          thought and symmetry of language; his spiritual _tempo_ was quick; as a writer he was
          short-winded. Hence short, sharp, strong sentences following each other at a gallop; no
          rounded periods. Metaphors abound; yet <pb n="51"/> they are not so numerous as to jostle
          each other out of place, and all are apt and suggestive; he did not ransack note-books for
          them, like Jean Paul; they presented themselves in modest abundance. He employed similes
          freely; but in his clear-headed fashion he arranged them almost algebraically in his
          sentences, so that they produce the effect rather of equations than of scattered
          flowers.</p>

        <p>By degrees his decidedly marked individuality took shape in a decidedly individual
          humorous style. Jean Paul's humour spreads itself throughout lengthy and discursive
          investigations, narratives, romances; not so Börne's. He was never able to produce a
          political, poetical, critical, or historical work of any length; he could not write books,
          only pages. His was an essentially journalistic talent.[6] And this determines the
          character of his humour.</p>

        <p>Playful humour was his, but also that sarcastic wit which stings like a lash, and yet
          thrills and touches by an indirect appeal to the feelings; his that bitterness of
          complaint and accusation which assumes the conciliatory form of an attempt to comfort; and
          that melancholy, which with a smile and a whimsical conceit rises above time and place.
          But something similar to this might be said of other great humorists. What distinguishes
          Börne (from Sterne, Jean Paul, and others) is, in the first place, the strength, the
          violence of the reaction produced in him by all the occurrences of the day which came
          within the bounds of his horizon. A comparatively trifling incident in real, and
          especially in public, life is sufficient to set all the chords of his being in vibration.
          The second peculiarity is that all occurrences directly act upon one and the same point in
          his spiritual life, that passion for liberty which was born of the keenest sense of
          justice. One of his critics, Steinthal, explains in a masterly manner the connection
          between this fact and the fact of his inability to produce a great work. He never thought
          systematically, never combined with each other all the many things that one after the
          other occupied and affected his <pb n="52"/> mind, but looked on each separately in its
          relation to the centre point of his being.[7] His humour brought the miserable reality
          into juxtaposition with the ideal demand of his intellect; but he gave no picture of the
          different elements of reality, he merely focussed them.</p>

        <p>Given such a state of matters, it is easy to understand how inevitable it was, not only
          that Börne should place Schiller high above Goethe, but also that he should consider Jean
          Paul to be greatly Schiller's superior. And it is highly characteristic that what he
          objects to in Schiller is not his purely poetical shortcomings, but his want of moral
          idealism. We are accustomed to think of Schiller as unassailable on this point, but to
          Börne's ruthless severity of moral requirement he is not so. Börne's pronouncement on the
          character of Wilhelm Tell is especially enlightening. To him Tell is nothing but a
          Philistine-- a good citizen, father, and husband, but a man the essence of whose character
          is submissiveness. He did not appear at the Rüth, that meeting-place of the elect, to take
          the oath; he had not the courage to be a conspirator. His words:</p>

        <p>"Der Starke ist am mächtigsten _allein_"-- (The strong man is strongest alone)</p>

        <p>are to Börne the philosophy of weakness; a man who has only the strength necessary to get
          the better of himself, is strongest alone, but he that has strength to spare after gaining
          the mastery over himself, will rule others also. The critic reviews Tell's actions one by
          one. Tell does not uncover to the hat on the pole, but his is not the noble defiance of
          the lover of liberty; it is only Philistine pride, a mixture of a sense of honour with
          fear; he passes the pole with his eyes cast down, that he may be able to say he has not
          seen it. And when Gessler calls him to account, he is humble--so humble that we are
          ashamed of him; he says the omission was accidental, and shall not occur again.</p>

        <p><pb n="53"/> The famous apple incident arouses no admiration in Börne. A father may dare
          everything for his child's life, but he has no right to hazard that life. Why did Tell not
          shoot the tyrant at once instead of beseeching like a woman with his reiterated "Lieber
          Herr! lieber Herr!"? He deserved to have his ears boxed. And when the governor, in the
          storm on the lake, trusted himself to him, as enemy trusts enemy, was it not treachery and
          a knavish trick on Tell's part to leap on shore, push the boat out into the lake and leave
          him to the mercy of the storm? Börne finds strong cause of offence in the speech:</p>

        <p> "Ich aber sprach: Ja, Herr mit Gottes Hilfe Getrau ich mir's, und helf uns wohl
          hindannen. So ward ich meiner Bande los und stand Am Steuerruder und _fuhr redlich
          hin._"[8]</p>

        <p>"How," exclaims the critic, "are we to explain such Jesuitry in the simple-minded man? It
          is inconceivable to me, too, that any one can consider Tell's next action moral, much less
          beautiful--he lies in safe ambush, and kills his enemy, who has no idea that he is in
          danger."</p>

        <p>No one can be surprised that a man in whose spiritual organism the sense of justice was
          so sharply, so intensely developed that it almost took the place of the æsthetic sense,
          should be wanting in the organ of appreciation for Goethe, whose craving for justice was
          undoubtedly less developed.</p>

        <p>In 1802, after one or two years' residence with a professor at Giessen, young Börne was
          sent to Berlin, his father being obliged to give in to his desire to study, although on
          account of his religion this could only lead to his becoming a doctor, a profession for
          which as yet he showed no turn whatever. He boarded in the house of the famous physician
          and Kantian, Marcus Herz, whose public lectures on philosophy had drawn such crowded and
          influential audiences, that the appointment of Professor of Philosophy was conferred on
          him before any University of Berlin existed. Herz was an eminent physician, a clear
          thinker, and a good orator; a friend of Lessing, whose <pb n="54"/> poetry he valued as
          highly as his critical writings. Hence the mysticism of the Romantic school, more
          especially Hardenberg's, was to him both meaningless and obnoxious. As he died in 1803,
          his influence on young Börne's development was inconsiderable. All the more powerful was
          the impression made on the youth by Herz's famous wife, Henriette, _née_ Lemos. She was
          seventeen years younger than her husband, to whom she was betrothed, without her consent
          being asked, at the age of twelve. Remarkably beautiful, mistress of many languages,
          admired by numbers of the most eminent scientific men and authors of the day, she made her
          house one of the most frequented, most talked of, most looked up to in Berlin. She was
          thirty-eight, Börne sixteen, but this naturally did not prevent the young man from at once
          falling violently, though hopelessly, in love with the most beautiful, most distinguished
          woman it had been his lot to meet.</p>

        <p>The charming Henriette presented in outward appearance, as well as in character, a marked
          contrast to her little, clever, ugly husband; she was a faultless beauty, tall and stately
          as Queen Louise, with the small head we see on Greek statues. She went by the name of the
          Tragic Muse or the Beautiful Circassian. She was worshipped by Wilhelm von Humboldt, by
          Mirabeau, by Schleiermacher, and after her husband's death she was surrounded by a bevy of
          men of position, who all wooed the fair widow in vain. She refused all offers, in spite of
          her poverty rejected even the hand of the richest noblemen in Germany, and took the place
          of governess to the future Empress of Russia. She was as severely virtuous as she was
          intoxicatingly beautiful. She was on terms of intimacy with more than one man, but always
          within the strict bounds of friendship.</p>

        <p>In her circle a line was drawn between the admissible coquetry which aims at enthralling
          the whole man, and the inadmissible, which only aims at enthralling his senses. She
          herself belonged to the dangerous class of virtuous flirts. Of a passionless temperament
          and much addicted to sentimental moralising, she founded in her younger days a
          "Tugendbund" (league of virtue), in which Wilhelm von <pb n="55"/> Humboldt played the
          principal part, and of which old and young, known and unknown men, were members. They
          called each other Thou, wrote long letters to each other in foreign languages or in Greek
          or Hebrew characters, exchanged rings or silhouettes, aimed at each other's "moral
          development," desired "to attain happiness by self-devotion" (unencumbered by duties, for
          self-devotion knows no duties), and ignored the rules and regulations of conventional
          propriety--but in all chastity and honour. Rahel laughed at them, and would have nothing
          to do with the league.</p>

        <p>The letters the members of the league exchanged bear a strong resemblance to those which
          passed a little later in Denmark between Kamma Rahbek and Molbech. They were absorbed in
          their own feelings, but in constant self-examination, thereby naturally depriving their
          feelings of all freshness. Friends of different sexes explained to each other in
          interminable letters, with written tears, how they mutually supplemented and developed one
          another. They tore themselves up into lint, and contemplated themselves in this unravelled
          condition; they did not collect themselves for each other's benefit, but spun themselves
          out. They put their inner man under pressure till the result was a liquid--tears, heart's
          blood, or such like--and this they poured into the bosom of a like-minded friend, without
          themselves becoming in any way more remarkable or original under this treatment.</p>

        <p>The beautiful and noble Henriette Herz herself was less an original personality than what
          the Germans call an "Anempfinderin." From the remarkable men with whom she came in
          contact, she seldom assimilated more than what she picked up from a surface knowledge of
          their ways and doings. What brought her particularly into notice was the tender friendship
          existing between her and Schleiermacher. It was much talked about in Berlin, but with no
          insinuation of evil. The contrast was too striking between the "Tragic Muse" and little
          Schleiermacher, whose distinguished head was set upon a fragile, slightly deformed body.
          People smiled good-naturedly when they saw the little pastor coming out of Henriettas
          house in the evening with a lantern <pb n="56"/> fastened to the button of his coat, or
          when they met him in the daytime hanging on the arm of his majestic Melpomene. A
          caricature appeared, in which she was represented carrying him--the jewel, as he was
          called--in her hand, like a parasol.[9]</p>

        <p>Even if young Börne had been the fresh, red-cheeked youth he was not, he would hardly
          have made much impression on his proud, spoiled foster-mother. At first she did not even
          understand what was the matter with the young man, whose passion--described in his own
          memoranda was a real school-boy worship, of the kind produced at his age by half-conscious
          instinct and exaggerated ideas of the perfection of woman. One or two attempts which he
          made, through the medium of the servant, to procure arsenic from an apothecary's, opened
          Henriette Herz's eyes to the position, and she did her best, by an admixture of kindness
          with strictness, to bring him to reason.[10] That she was not quite insensible to his
          adoration, or quite innocent of a certain amount of coquetry, which masqueraded in this
          case as motherliness, is shown by the following little incident. Börne had taken her to be
          between twenty-eight and thirty, but at the dinner-table, on the 3rd of December 1802, she
          told him that she was thirty-four. In the evening she added two to this figure, but she
          never acknowledged more than the thirty-six, and on the 5th of March 1803, Börne still
          supposes this to be her age. So the charming "Frau Mutter," as she allowed him to call
          her, made herself two years younger than she was. Naturally he continued to love, to
          admire, to despair, to suffer the pangs of hell because of her indifference, and to feel
          the bliss of heaven when she smiled at him or said a friendly word; also to be so
          suspicious, bitter, unreasonable, and capricious that at last it became necessary to send
          him away.</p>

        <p>He went to Halle to continue his studies there. As he was leaving he handed her the diary
          of his emotions--she had, it seems, advised him to pour forth his sorrows on paper--and a
          number of passionate letters addressed to herself. He continued to write to her from Halle
          with un<pb n="57"/>changeable devotion and passionate longing, but in absence he soon so
          far recovers himself as no longer to be entirely absorbed in the sifting of his own
          feelings; we presently have calm and entertaining criticism of his surroundings, and a
          certain dignified self-esteem, combined with self-criticism. In these letters we already
          notice the characteristic combination of enthusiasm for ideas, indignant denunciation of
          slavishness, and sharp satire. They give us an understanding of Börne's real nature--a
          temperament to which licentiousness presents as little temptation as does drink, a soul
          that suffers under weakness of body, suffers from the inward conflict that ensues where
          there is courage without power, love that meets no return, undefined longing to do great
          deeds without any definite aim. Here and there we come upon a threat of what, when once
          his powers are matured, awaits the Philistine crowd that now smile at him--upon a wrathful
          presentiment of future humiliations, and fiery projects of revenge on those who, as he
          already knows, will shamelessly revile him because of his birth, and torture him by
          calling his reserve cowardice.[11] It is plain that one result of young Börne's stay in
          Berlin has been the maturing of his emotional life, and also that his intellectual powers
          have been stimulated by his being brought into contact, in Marcus and Henriette Herz's
          house, with the most eminent men of the day.</p>

        <p>Börne was studying at Halle when the battle of Jena was fought. Shortly afterwards that
          university was suppressed by Napoleon, and he went to pursue his studies at Heidelberg,
          full of patriotic rancour against the French, to which he gave vent in a pamphlet which
          the censor refused to pass. Whilst one result of Napoleon's triumphal progress was the
          expulsion of the students from Halle, another was a complete revolution in the political
          conditions of Börne's native town. In 1806 Dalberg, as "Prince-Primas" of the <pb n="58"/>
          newly formed Rhenish Confederation, took possession of Frankfort-on-Main. One of his first
          acts was to improve the position of the Jews, and in 1810 Napoleon issued an ordinance
          removing all burdens resting upon them and upon serfs. In 1811 the Jewish community in
          Frankfort received the full rights of citizens, in consideration of a sum of 440,000
          guldens, which was paid up by the following year. The first result of all this, as far as
          Börne was concerned, was that he gave up the study of medicine, which he had taken to
          unwillingly, and only because he was debarred from every other, and entered on that of
          political economy and jurisprudence, as opening the way to a government appointment. In
          1818 he took the degree of Doctor of Philosophy.</p>

        <p>His father, who had been extremely dissatisfied with his want of application as a
          student, and with being constantly called on to pay small debts, and who was now no less
          dissatisfied with him for throwing up the study of medicine, insisted that he should begin
          to support himself, and procured for him a small post in the Frankfort police
          establishment, an appointment which contrasts comically with the position which he
          afterwards took as an author.</p>

        <p>He was appointed "Aktuarius," sat in the old, dark Römer building, examined passports and
          journeymen's certificates, entered minutes, and on state occasions, dressed in uniform and
          wearing a sword, represented local authority.</p>

        <p>But he had also by this time made his _début_ as a writer. He contributed to a Frankfort
          daily paper articles crammed with primeval German rhetoric, defying the mighty Corsican
          with a patriotic enthusiasm which he at times allows to run away with common sense. They
          are appeals to the youth of Germany, and passionate expressions of blind, loyal faith in
          the rulers of Germany.[12] He is absolutely hopeful of the result of "the war of
          liberation."</p>

        <p><pb n="59"/>He had no foreboding that he himself would be one of the first victims of
          victory. Hardly had the Emperors of Russia and Austria and the King of Prussia entered
          Frankfort, when the seven years' rule of Prince Dalberg came to an end. The Grand Duchy of
          Frankfort was blotted from the list of States, and the old constitution came into force
          again. The citizenship which the Jews had acquired at such a high price was simply taken
          from them again, of course without the return of the money. "It was," writes Karl Gutzkow,
          "as if the couriers who rushed back and forwards between Vienna, where the Peace Congress
          was sitting, and the other German towns where reactionary congresses were being held, tore
          furrows in the blood-manured soil of Germany, in which the ruling powers dared to sow the
          seed of the old prejudices and privileges."</p>

        <p>The fall of the French power deprived Börne of his appointment, and his brothers in
          misfortune of their rights as men; he was impersonal enough in his way of looking at
          things to consider the foreign rule a disgrace from first to last.</p>

        <p>It is not surprising that Goethe's indifference to this, as to other results of the great
          reaction, strengthened Börne's hatred for a personality that appeared great upon no side
          accessible to him. In his notice of Bettina's book, _Goethe's Briefwechsel mit einem
          Kinde_ ("Goethe's Correspondence with a Child")--perhaps the most misleading criticism he
          ever wrote--Börne says: "What made Goethe, that greatest of poets, the smallest of men?
          What entwined hops and parsley in his wreath of laurel? What set a night-cap on his lofty
          brow? What made him a slave of circumstances, a cowardly Philistine, a mere provincial? He
          was a Protestant, and his family belonged to the ruling class in Frankfort, from among
          whom its senators were chosen. At the age of sixty, at the zenith of his fame, with the
          incense-clouds under his feet separating and sheltering him from the base passions of the
          valley-dweller, it angered him to hear that the Frankfort Jews demanded the rights of
          citizens, and he foamed with rage at the 'humanitarian twaddlers' who championed their
          cause."</p>

        <p><pb n="60"/> It was his relations with the great ones of the earth that Börne could least
          of all forgive Goethe.</p>

        <p>He overlooked the fact that the generation that lay between him and Goethe meant a
          complete change in the position of the author towards men of rank and the public
          generally. In Germany in the eighteenth century authors did not live on their works, but
          on their dedications. Poets were obliged to seek the favour of a high-born patron, to
          educate young noblemen, or accompany young princes on their educational tours. Wieland
          accepted money in return for his dedications; Schiller gladly accepted the assistance
          which the Duke of Augustenburg procured for him from Denmark. In the end of the eighteenth
          century, kings, princes, and the aristocracy generally, took a true and keen interest in
          philosophy and poetry, in all the new truth and beauty; they sought the acquaintance of
          authors, and associated with them as with their equals. With the French Revolution these
          admirable relations came to an end, but Goethe's position dated from before the
          Revolution.</p>

        <p>Börne blinded himself with gazing at disconnected expressions of Goethe's veneration for
          rank. Somewhere or other he copies this passage from Goethe's diary: "I afterwards had the
          unexpected happiness of being permitted to pay my homage to their Imperial Highnesses the
          Grand Duke Nicholas and his consort, in my own house and garden. The Grand Duchess
          graciously allowed me to write some lines of poetry in her elegantly splendid album."
          Börne adds: "This he wrote in his seventy-first year. What youthful power!" The older
          Börne grew, and the more he developed, by his own conscious volition, into a simple
          incarnation of political conviction, into a being of whose feelings, talents, and wit
          political conviction had taken possession, to whom it had become a religion, with all the
          outward expressions of religion, faith, worship, fanaticism--the more unworthy and
          contemptible did Goethe's rôle of spectator of the political struggles of the day appear
          to him. Elsewhere he writes: "I have finished Goethe's journal. No drier or more lifeless
          soul exists in the wide world, and nothing can be more comical than the simplicity <pb
            n="61"/> with which he lays bare his own callousness.... And these are the consuls
          chosen by the German people--Goethe, who, more timid than a mouse, burrows in the ground,
          and gladly dispenses with light, air, liberty, everything, so long as he is left in peace
          in his hole gnawing at his stolen bacon; and Schiller, more noble, but equally
          faint-hearted, who seeks refuge from tyranny above the clouds, where he vainly cries to
          the gods for aid, and, dazzled by the sun, loses sight of the earth, and forgets the human
          beings whom he intended to help. And meanwhile the unhappy country, without leaders,
          without guardians, without advisers, without protectors, falls a prey to its kings, and
          the nation becomes a byeword among nations."</p>

        <p>From the summer of 1818 onwards, Börne, who till then had only published an occasional
          pamphlet, appears as an independent journalist, publisher of the _Die Wage_ ("The
          Balance"), most of the articles in which he wrote himself. He was the first German
          journalist in the grand style, and first to make the periodical press of Germany a power.
          The possessors of the now rare numbers of that old epoch-making magazine "of politics,
          science, and art," look on them as treasures. Its success is to be ascribed to its
          publisher and chief contributor's lively style and apt wit. It treated of politics,
          literature, and the drama, and had on its staff men like Görres (before his conversion)
          and Willemer, Goethe's rationalistic, liberal-minded friend ("Suleika's" husband); but
          whatever the subject under treatment might be, it took a political colouring from the
          manner in which it was approached. For three months of the four years during which Börne
          continued to publish _Die Wage_, he was also editor of the daily newspaper, _Zeitung der
          freien Stadt Frankfurt_, a position he had to give up because of the constant annoyance to
          which he was subjected by the censorship. He afterwards edited another daily paper, _Die
          Zeitschwingen_; but this was suppressed, and its editor sentenced to a short imprisonment.
          Börne now paid his first visit to Paris, whence he for a time wrote letters for Cotta's
          various periodical publications; but by 1822 he was again in Germany, where a long and
          dangerous illness soon <pb n="62"/> swallowed up all his savings, and compelled him to
          apply to his father for assistance.</p>

        <p>His father was exceedingly dissatisfied with him. All his other children did him credit,
          he said; but this son, now unable to support himself, had had a most expensive education,
          and what was there to show for it? He could do nothing but write articles with a tendency
          highly disapproved of by his (the father's) patron, Prince Metternich, in Vienna. What was
          the good of making enemies for himself? of attacking the great? Was it becoming in his
          position of life? What position, indeed, did he suppose himself to occupy, seeing he
          allowed himself such liberty of speech? By this time he might have been a doctor in good
          practice, or a barrister, and counsel for Rothschild; instead of which he elected to be a
          hack writer for periodicals, spending the trifle he got for his articles on travelling,
          and closing every avenue to success by his impious attacks on those in authority.</p>

        <p>And Börne's father had sufficient political sagacity to be aware that it was quite
          unnecessary for his son to be either a doctor or an advocate in order to find lucrative
          employment. He knew very well where Herr von Gentz's and Herr Friedrich von Schlegel's
          bank-drafts came from. And besides, had not his son Maria Theresa's promise to fall back
          on?[13]</p>

        <p>From the very commencement of Börne's career as a journalist, his talent had attracted
          the attention of the great reactionaries. On the 18th of May 1819, Rahel writes that Gentz
          has recommended _Die Wage_ to her, as containing the cleverest, wittiest writing of the
          day, the best of its kind since Lessing's time. Börne's father was perfectly aware that
          Herr von Gentz praised his son's style, and Prince Metternich his grasp of politics.[14]
          So he privately <pb n="63"/> set to work to secure an advantageous sphere of operation for
          him on the sunny side of society. Before young Börne was told anything about it,
          Metternich had eagerly come forward with the most liberal proposals: The young man was to
          live in Vienna with the title, position, and emoluments of an Imperial Councillor
          (kaiserlicher Rath), and with no claim made on him for any service in return. Everything
          he chose to write was to be entirely exempt from censorship; he should be his own censor.
          And if, in the course of a few months, he should elect to give up his appointment, he was
          to be free to do so. In such a position he would have the very best opportunity of working
          for the cause of progress and humanity.</p>

        <p>His father wrote: "Dear Louis! I beg of you to read this letter as carefully as I have
          read it. Believe me, the independence you prize so highly is an uncertain possession; will
          you, can you retain it? Why should not you, too, at last think of making a settled
          position for yourself?... On what is your present bliss founded? Surely not on the 500
          francs (Cotta's monthly payment)? Make up your mind, for the sake of your future, to take
          a journey to Vienna at my expense; I beseech of you not to throw away this chance of
          success...."</p>

        <p>Börne refused everything point blank, refused to hold any communication with those in
          power.[15] Goethe might allow himself to be appointed Privy Councillor at a court, but he,
          Börne, would not. And yet the temptation must have been greater in the case of the born
          plebeian, who had had to take off his hat at the bidding of every passer-by, than it was
          in the case of the great patrician. In reading the hard, contemptuous, and unjust words
          which Börne wrote of Goethe, we must not forget that behind these words there was a man
          who would not do what Goethe did.</p>

        <p>Börne was devoid of artistic sense in the strict acceptation of the term. He frankly
          confessed the fact himself, and, moreover, betrays it in his intolerance of those to <pb
            n="64"/> whom it is a matter of indifference what the artist represents, but
          all-important how he represents it. Artists and connoisseurs of this type are utterly
          repugnant to him. It disgusts him that any man can prefer a painting of still life to a
          painting of a Madonna. His natural bias towards the lofty, the sublime, the divine, leads
          him to demand these qualities in art, and to declare frankly that all works of art in
          which these qualities are wanting, are to him simply daubs or monstrosities.[16]</p>

        <p>We cannot agree with Steinthal when he says that Börne was at home in every domain of
          culture, every sphere of artistic production; for that very branch of art to which the
          name art is more specially applied, was a sealed book to him. This naturally did not
          prevent his writing much that is sensible and instructive about works of art; but what he
          wrote is not art criticism.</p>

        <p>Börne has been often and much praised for his energetic condemnation of the German
          fatalistic tragedies (_Schicksalstragödien_) which began in his day to take possession of
          the stage and to confuse men's minds. But it is to be observed that it is not as
          æsthetically reprehensible that he objects to them; he looks at the matter from the moral
          or religious point of view. The belief that a certain date, say the 24th of February, is
          peculiarly fraught with fate for any family, is stupid and futile. It has no connection
          whatever either with the belief of the ancients in an inevitable, pre-ordained fate, or
          with the Christian belief in an omniscient Providence, or with the modern determinist
          theory of cause and effect, which has undermined the earlier belief in so-called freewill.
          But to Börne the belief in question is an unreasonable one only because it is a confusion
          of two theological systems. His chain of reasoning is this: death is either a loving
          father, who takes his child home, in which case fate is not tragic, or a Kronos, who
          devours his own children, in which <pb n="65"/> case it is unchristian.[17] As if that
          were any objection! It might still be extremely poetical.</p>

        <p>Börne is so clever and clear-headed that his opinion as to the worth or worthlessness of
          the many dramas it falls to his lot to criticise is almost always correct. He thoroughly
          enters into the spirit of Oehlenschläger's _Correggio_, and is full of indulgence for the
          weaknesses of the play, but quite oblivious to its scenic effect. He shows thorough
          appreciation of dramatists like Kleist and Immermann and young Grillparzer. But when he
          begins to give his reasons for blame or praise, the inartistic temperament invariably
          betrays itself, and he frequently displays all the many prejudices of the idealist. He is
          undoubtedly justified in his unfavourable opinion of Inland's _Die Spieler_ ("The
          Gamblers"), for instance. But the justification he offers is most peculiar: "What has
          gambling to do on the stage?" he cries; "one might as well dramatise consumption in all
          its different stages." There is only this difference, one would imagine, that consumption
          is a physical ailment, gambling a vice. His position is one that is characteristic of
          idealism, namely, that there is no need to go to the theatre to see what we can see at
          home. He gives as examples poverty, debt, a faithful wife's patient endurance of
          hardships; and instead of remarking on the dull, inartistic spirit in which such things
          are represented, he exclaims: "Are these such rare sights that we should pay money to see
          them? On the stage, humanity ought to be raised a step above its common level." And he
          goes on to explain that it was for this reason the Greek and Roman tragedians had recourse
          to mythic fable, and to maintain that the modern dramatist ought to represent the real
          characters of ancient days; or, if nothing will serve him but to grapple with the present,
          that he must only venture to reproduce its passions. We perceive that Börne is possessed
          by the naïve belief that the <pb n="66"/> "classic" characters of olden times stood on a
          higher level than the human beings of to-day; and that he does not understand how
          every-day reality, properly treated, can be refined into art.</p>

        <p>A still stronger proof than these academic utterances of Börne's inability to appreciate
          simple, primitive poetry, is his indifference to the Old Testament. In a letter to
          Henriette Herz, written in his nineteenth year, we come upon a passage of absolutely
          alarming sterility, dry and senile as a joke on the Pentateuch by Voltaire-- and this
          after Goethe: "It has always appeared to me as if it had been the intention of the old
          Jews, from Abraham down to Solomon the Wise, to parody the history of the world. Read
          Joshua or the Book of Kings, and you will at once be struck by their resemblance to
          Blumau."[18] A comparison between these venerable compilations of memorable legends and
          historical events and a clumsy German parody of Virgil's _Æneid_ could only be instituted
          by a critic who, devoid of all appreciation of antique literary form, set himself to find
          in every work some modern sentimental, religious, or political moral. It is quite of a
          piece with this that Börne should end by blindly admiring the vague, half Biblical, half
          modern unctuous pathos of Lamennais' _Paroles d'un Croyant._</p>

        <p>[14] Metternich was even acquainted with the later, quite revolutionary letters from
          Paris. On the 26th of January 1834, Princess Melanie Metternich writes in her diary: "I
          spent the early hours of the evening with Clemens, to whom I read Börne's _Letters from
          Paris_. They are of course as malicious as possible, but the style, with its dæmonic
          extravagance, is remarkably clever." (Metternich's _Posthumous Papers_, v. 545, quoted by
          Holzmann.)</p>

        <p>[15] He writes to his father: "Gentz, too, was doubtless a Liberal to begin with, but he
          could give securities for a sincere conversion which I cannot give. He had been sold to
          England for many years before he took service with Austria. He is sensual, extravagant,
          the most dissolute man in the country."</p>

        <p>[16] "A frog, a cucumber, a leg of mutton, a Wilhelm Meister, a Christ--it is all the
          same to them; they actually forgive a Madonna her holiness, if she is well painted. So am
          not I, and never was. In nature I have always sought God, God only, and in art the divine;
          and where I did not find God, I saw nothing but miserable botch-work. History, men, and
          books I have judged in like manner--unfortunately!"</p>

        <p>[17] "I have never been able to understand their conception of fate, their confusion of
          the antique with the Romantic idea, their Christian paganism. Death is either a loving
          father, who comes to fetch his child home from the school of life, in which case fate is
          not tragic; or he is the cannibal Kronos, who swallows his own children, in which case it
          is unchristian. Your fate is a hermaphrodite, unable either to beget or to bring
          forth."</p>

        <p>BÖRNE</p>

        <p>But for this lack of poetic-artistic understanding, it would be difficult to explain how
          Börne came to take the share he did in the reaction against Goethe which was set on foot
          by some of the leading men of the day. For, though he had a quite individual, spontaneous
          animosity to Goethe, Börne was certainly not the originator of the reaction, which was in
          full swing before he took any part in it. About the time when the Pietists were gloating
          over Pastor Pustkuchen's parody of the _Wanderjahre_, with its attack on the impiety of
          Goethe, the pagan, progressive, youthful politicians were beginning to approve of
          investigations into Goethe's political convictions, which measured them by the very latest
          standard and made him out to be an "aristocrat," with no feeling for the people, and in
          reality with no genius.</p>

        <p>The first writer of any note who perseveringly and fanatically devoted himself to the
          systematic disparagement of Goethe was Wolfgang Menzel (born in 1798), a man who before
          the age of thirty had made his name famous and feared by the help of a certain coarse
          literary ability, tremendous self-assurance, and the severity of his creed as a Liberal,
          Nationalist, and moralist. Like Börne, he was originally a disciple of Jean Paul. But his
          _Streckverse_ (1823), which were much admired in their day, and which are unmistakable
          imitations of that master, carry Jean Paul's peculiar kind of humour to the verge of
          caricature. Things that have no natural connection whatever with each other are forced
          into juxtaposition to produce an aphorism, in much the same manner as totally unconnected
          ideas are coupled together in a pun. He writes: "All Saints' Day <pb n="68"/> comes before
          All Souls'; the prophets reach heaven before the people." "The religion of antiquity was
          the crystal-matrix of many resplendent gods; the Christian religion is the mother-of-pearl
          that encloses one god only, but one beyond all price." "This mortal life is a bastinado."
          "Every church bell is a diving-bell, beneath which the pearl of religion is found."[1]</p>

        <p>In his periodical, _Deutsche Litteratur_, he began, in 1819, an attack upon Goethe, which
          he carried on with insane conceit and immovable faith in the justice of his cause. He
          first tried to undermine the admiration of the reading world for Goethe's originality,
          examined his works with the aim of discovering imitations or plagiarisms, and demonstrated
          the existence of foreign influence everywhere throughout them.</p>

        <p>In his first connected work on the history of literature, _Die deutsche Litteratur_,
          which was published in 1828, in two parts, he calmly accuses Goethe of having flattered
          all the prejudices and vanities of his time. He declares him to be possessed of nothing
          more than great descriptive ability, great "talent," which is a thing unattended by inward
          conviction, "a hetaira, who is at every one's beck and call." Goethe has always, he
          declares, swum with the stream, and on its surface, like a cork; he has ministered to
          every weakness and folly that happened to be in fashion; under the fair mask of his works
          a refinement of sensuality lies concealed; these works are the blossom of that materialism
          which prevails in the modern world. Goethe has no genius, but a very high degree of "the
          talent for making his readers his accomplices," &amp;c, &amp;c.[2] Heine, who was
          uncritical enough in his review of the book to praise both it and its author--praise which
          he was soon to regret--would have nothing to say to Menzel's doctrine that Goethe's gift
          was not genius, only talent. He <pb n="69"/> expresses the opinion that this doctrine will
          be accepted by few, "and even these few will confess that Goethe at times had the talent
          to be a genius."[3]</p>

        <p>Menzel continued the cannonade in his numerous contributions to periodicals, and in a
          new, very much enlarged, edition of his work on German literature. He convicts Goethe of
          three distinct kinds of personal vanity and six kinds of voluptuousness ("dreierlei
          Eitelkeiten und sechserlei Wollüsteleien"). He analyses his works, great and small, one by
          one, measures them by his own patriotic standard, and declares them to be despicable.
          _Clavigo_ he condemns, because Goethe makes Clavigo desert Marie. That he afterwards makes
          him die by the hand of her brother goes for nothing, in fact is only an additional cause
          of offence to Menzel, who knows that in real life Clavigo lived on happily, which make his
          death on the stage a mere _coup de théâtre._[4] To find sufficient immorality in the play,
          the critic must, we observe, take advantage of his knowledge of circumstances that do not
          concern it. _Tasso_ is to him Goethe's _Höflingsbekenntniss_ ("Confessions of a
          Courtier"), in which he betrays the vanity of the _parvenu_, to whom the high rank of a
          woman is an irresistible attraction.[5] The reader will have no difficulty in imagining
          for himself all the moral reflections for which Menzel finds occasion in _Die
          Mitschuldigen_, in _Die Geschwister_, where "voluptuousness casts sidelong glances at the
          pretty sister," in _Stella_, where it craves the excitement of bigamy ("nach dem Reiz der
          Bigamie gelüstet") and in the _Mann von fünfzig Jahren_, which is the special object of
          his indignation. <pb n="70"/> Even _Wilhelm Meister_ is to Menzel only an expression of
          the shamefully light esteem in which Goethe held true virtue, and the strong attraction
          which the outward conditions of rank possessed for him.[6] _Die Wahlverwandschaften_ he
          regards as the type of "the novel of adultery," which takes for its theme the desire of
          voluptuousness after untried sensations ("die Wollüstelei, die das Fremde begehrt"). _Die
          Braut von Korinth_ is simply the expression of the voluptuousness whose desire is set on
          corpses, "die sogar noch in den Schauern des Grabes, in der Buhlerei mit schönen
          Gespenstern einen _haut goût_ des Genusses findet"--(which even amidst the horrors of the
          grave finds a _haut goût_ of sensual enjoyment in intercourse with beautiful
          spectres).</p>

        <p>Where it is impossible to bring an accusation of immorality, Menzel returns to his
          accusation of want of originality. It is not only its glorification of middle-class
          Philistinism that stamps _Hermann und Dorothea_ as an inferior work, but also the direct
          imitation of Voss's _Luise_. According to Menzel, Goethe showed real originality only in
          _Faust_ and _Wilhelm Meister_, because in these two works he copied himself. In his youth
          he borrowed from Moliere and Beaumarchais, from Shakespeare and Lessing, and his later
          iambic tragedies are "the fruits of his rivalry with Schiller." Added to all this, he was,
          God knows, no patriot.</p>

        <p>Let us compare Börne's attacks on Goethe with Menzel's, and we shall find, in spite of
          similar extravagance of expression, this great difference, that Börne does not attempt to
          judge, still less to condemn Goethe's great works, nor does he condescend to accusations
          of sexual immorality; he invariably confines himself to attacking Goethe in his political
          relations. Saint-René Taillandier correctly observes that Börne gave expression to
          everything that was rankling in his heart when he took as motto for his review of
          Bettina's <pb n="71"/> _Goethe's Briefwechsel mit einem Kinde_ ("Goethe's Correspondence
          with a Child"), these words from _Prometheus_:</p>

        <p> "Ich dich ehren? Wofür? Hast du die Schmerzen gelindert Je des Beladenen? Hast du die
          Thränen gestillet Je des Geängsteten?"[7]</p>

        <p>Though he could only appreciate those of Goethe's works in which the fire of youth was
          perceptible, his attacks are not based on contempt for the other works, but on the fact
          that Goethe, so highly favoured in the matter of ability and of social position, never
          thought of devoting that ability, that position, to the improvement of the existing
          conditions of life in Germany. It is easy to cull foolish passages conceived in Menzel's
          strain from Börne's works. In his Journal of 1830, for instance, he writes of Goethe's
          luck in having succeeded in imitating with his talent the handwriting of genius for sixty
          years without being detected; and in another place he calls Goethe the rhyming, Hegel the
          rhymeless, thrall.[8] But to understand these wild and regrettable outbursts, we must make
          ourselves acquainted with Börne's bill of accusation against both Goethe and Schiller.</p>

        <p>He started from the premise (in all probability quite a false one) that Goethe, by making
          timely and energetic protest, could have prevented the Resolutions of Karlsbad, could have
          secured the liberty of the press and the other spiritual rights of which the reaction had
          deprived the German nation. In any case, whatever the results might have been, he was
          firmly convinced that it was Goethe's duty to have protested. Instead of this, what
          happens? "Geheimrath von Goethe, the Karlsbad poet," as Börne, knowing that he goes there
          every year to drink the waters, <pb n="72"/> satirically nicknames him, subscribes himself
          _servant_ among other servants of his Prince ("wir sämmtlichen Diener"); confesses in his
          _Tag- und Jahres-Hefte_ that he wrote his stupid little play _Der Bürgergeneral_ (the
          whole plot of which hinges on the stealing of a pail of milk from the peasant Martin),
          with the intention of ridiculing the French Revolution; also confesses that, far from
          taking Fichte's part when that philosopher was accused of teaching atheism in the
          University of Jena, he was much annoyed at the vexation caused to the court by the outside
          interference which Fichte's utterances provoked.[9] Another cause of offence was the way
          in which, when Oken's _Isis_ was published, Goethe bewailed the peaceful times brought to
          an end by the establishment of the liberty of the press in Weimar, "the further
          consequences of which every right-thinking man with any knowledge of the world foresees
          with alarm and regret."[10] And the same feeling of disappointment and mortification was
          aroused in Börne when he read that Schiller, whom he highly esteemed, had at the very
          crisis of the French Revolution declared in his announcement of the new periodical _Die
          Horen_, that from this publication everything in the nature of criticism of the
          government, of religion, or of the political questions of the day, would be expressly and
          strictly excluded.[11]</p>

        <p>We must bear all this in mind when we read Börne's flaming denunciations--ablaze with a
          passion for liberty that forgets to be just--of Schiller and of Goethe, his lament that in
          their correspondence these two greatest minds of Germany show themselves so small that
          nothing at all would be better ("so Nichts sind--nein weniger als Nichts, so wenig"), and
          that they actually are what he, the confirmed democrat, considers the worst thing
          possible, a pair of confirmed aristocrats. He sees in Schiller a <pb n="73"/> worse
          aristocrat than Goethe, for Goethe's partiality is merely for the upper classes of
          society, whereas Schiller will associate with none but the _élite_ of humanity. It is
          Börne's belief that Goethe might have been the Hercules who should cleanse the Augean
          stables of his country; but he rather elected to fetch the golden apples of the
          Hesperides, and to keep them for himself.[12] He compares him in his own mind with the
          great productive spirits of other countries; with Dante, who championed the cause of
          justice; with Alfieri, who preached liberty; with Montesquieu, who wrote the _Lettres
          Persanes_; with Voltaire, who dared everything and gave up all his other occupations to
          assist a persecuted man, or to vindicate the memory of one who had been unjustly condemned
          to death; with the republican Milton; with Byron, whose life was one struggle against
          tyranny, intelligent or unintelligent--and he summons him before the judgment seat of
          posterity. "That terrible, incorruptible judge will say to Goethe: A mighty mind was given
          to thee, didst thou ever employ it to oppose baseness? Heaven gave thee a tongue of fire,
          didst thou ever champion justice? Thou hadst a good sword, but it was drawn to defend
          thyself alone."[13]</p>

        <p>We cannot deny that Börne has pointed to real flaws in Goethe's greatness, and to real
          limitations in his nature, even though we know that some of his qualities were bought at
          the price of these defects, and that a certain limitation was inevitable if the
          many-sidedness of his genius was not to be its bane. It was not for him to do what Börne
          required of him. Still we must understand the proportion of justice there is in Börne's
          attacks, to be able to forgive him this violent and foolish expression of resentment
          against Goethe during those years when the hopes of the Liberals in the results of the
          Revolution of July were receiving their double death-blow, from the subjection of the
          French Government to the power of the great financiers, and from the suppression of the
          Polish revolt. He is now more bitter and violent than ever. He calls Goethe a prodigious
            <pb n="74"/> _obstructive_ power, compares him to a cataract on the eye of Germany, and
          expresses the opinion that not until the old man of Weimar dies will German liberty be
          born. (Nov. 20, 1830.)[14]</p>

        <p>It was on the 1st of October 1831, after whole days spent in despair over events which
          conveyed the impression, specially painful to this obstinately hopeful man, that France
          was lost and the reaction victorious, that his anger reached boiling-point. He took up
          Goethe's _Tag- und Jahres-hefte_, and was horrified by its author's "apathy." Goethe tells
          how, when he was with the army in Silesia in 1790, he wrote one or two epigrams, and how
          later, at the royal headquarters in Breslau, he lived the life of a hermit, completely
          engrossed in the study of comparative anatomy. He adds that what originally led to his
          taking up this study was his finding a half-cloven sheep's skull one evening in Venice on
          the sand-hills of the Lido.</p>

        <p>"What!" writes Börne, "Goethe, a highly gifted man, a poet, in the best years of his
          manhood ... to be in the council of war, in the camp of the Titans, on the very spot
          where, forty years before, the audacious yet sublime war of kings against their peoples
          began, and to find no inspiration in these surroundings, to be moved to neither love nor
          hatred, neither prayer nor curse, to nothing but a few epigrams, which he himself does not
          consider worth offering the reader. And with the finest of regiments, the handsomest of
          officers passing in review before him, he finds nothing better to turn his attention to
          than comparative anatomy! And walking by the sea-shore in Venice--Venice, that _Arabian
          Night_ in stone and mortar, where everything is melody and colour, both nature and art,
          man <pb n="75"/> and state, past and present, liberty and despotism; where even tyranny
          and murder merely clank like the chains in some gruesome ballad (the Bridge of Sighs and
          the Council of Ten are scenes from Tartarus)--Venice, towards which I turn my longing
          eyes, but cannot turn my steps, because the Austrian police lies in wait like a serpent at
          the city gates and repels with the terror of its poisonous gaze--there, after sunset, when
          the red glow of evening was spread over sea and land, and the waves of crimson light broke
          upon the man of stone, and imparted their colour to his eternal greyness; when, perhaps,
          the spirit of Werther came upon him, and he felt that he still had a heart, that there
          were human beings around him and a God above him; and the beat of his heart, the
          apparition of his dead youth terrified him, and he felt the hair standing up on his
          head--he behaved as usual, escaped from his terrors, avoided all disagreeable reflection,
          by creeping into a cloven sheep's skull and hiding there till night and coldness once more
          descended upon his heart! And I am to honour that man! to love that man! I would sooner
          throw myself in the dust at the feet of Vitzli-Putzli, sooner lick the spittle of the
          Dalai Lama!"</p>

        <p>Certainly Börne ought to have honoured this man, and for the very reason for which he
          despises him. For perhaps at no time was he more clearly worthy of all honour. Börne, by
          his own showing, would, like the ordinary tourist in Venice, have spent himself in vague
          moonlight and sunset romancings on the subject of the Bridge of Sighs, the terrors of
          tyranny, the blessings of liberty, and all the melody and colour--Goethe gazed at his
          sheep's skull. What was there remarkable about it? It was split; and with his naked eye,
          that seeing eye which pierced into the deepest recesses of nature, into the innermost
          workshop of life, whence issue all its various forms, Goethe _saw_ the great truth, which
          he had already suspected, that all the bones of the skull were in reality metamorphosed
          vertebræ, thus making a discovery in the science of osteology that was closely connected
          with one he had already given to the world in his work on the _Metamorphosis of Plants_,
          and <pb n="76"/> founding philosophic anatomy, as he had already founded philosophic
          botany. Börne did not perceive that this man, whose life-work is one of the
          foundation-stones in the edifice of the modern world, in this particular instance, with
          his intuition of the unity underlying all variety of form, in his divine simplicity,
          resembles one of the fathers of ancient science, a Thales or a Heraclitus.</p>

        <p>Börne's attacks on Goethe do not come under the same category as Menzel's. They are never
          malicious, much less base. Though they certainly now and again hit some vulnerable spot in
          the great man, they throw more light on Börne's own nature than they do on Goethe's; and,
          even where they most clearly show the limitation of his intelligence, they witness to the
          purity of his character. They have been powerless to affect men's admiration for Goethe's
          genius. It would be as foolish to judge Goethe by the false political standard set up by
          Börne in 1830 as to judge Börne himself by the false German standard of 1870, which those
          do, who say of him, what he said of Goethe, that he was no true patriot. It was natural,
          nay inevitable, that Börne should undervalue Goethe. It is possible to understand his want
          of understanding without sharing his dislike. And it is possible to do full justice to the
          rush of his pathos, to the elasticity and keen sparkle of his wit, without forgetting, as
          our eyes light on the seething, flashing cascades of his prose, that there is a deep,
          calm, wide ocean, called Goethe.</p>

        <p>BÖRNE</p>

        <p>It is in the first volumes of the _Letters from Paris_ that Börne reaches his high-water
          mark as an author. He was not capable of writing books, not even of writing essays and
          dissertations; for his explosions of emotion or thought there was no form so suitable as
          that of a letter. And these are real letters, not newspaper-articles, nor even newspaper
          correspondence, but letters written to a friend, without thought of publication until that
          friend took the initiative, and asked Börne's permission to make an experimental selection
          of passages which might be of interest to the general public.</p>

        <p>The friend in question was Frau Jeannette Wohl, a lady who plays an important part in
          Börne's life, though perhaps not so important a part as he plays in hers. For upwards of
          twenty years, from 1816, when he made her acquaintance, till his death in 1837, he gave
          her his entire confidence, and rarely took any step without consulting her; and to her,
          during the same period, his career as an author, his health, his circumstances generally,
          were of more importance than all else.</p>

        <p>When they saw each other for the first time, he was thirty and she thirty-three. She had
          been married to a rich man, with whom she had lived unhappily. After nursing him through a
          long illness, she got a divorce from him, refusing to accept any share of his fortune or
          to retain his name. When Börne and she lived in the same town, he read aloud to her
          everything that he wrote; when they were separated, she would at one time urge him to
          work, eager that he should win fame and independence; at another, fearing that he was too
          diligent, and that his health, at all times precarious, might suffer, she would beg him
          not to be too <pb n="78"/> conscientious in the fulfilment of his engagements to the
          publishers, but to allow himself sufficient leisure and recreation.</p>

        <p>Jealous of his honour, she underwent long periods of anxiety and irritation when it
          seemed to her that he was neglecting his duty to the public. Börne had taken payment in
          advance from the subscribers to _Die Wage_ for the second volume of that periodical, and
          then, after bringing out only five numbers, made a lengthy pause, partly because he was
          tired of the work, and partly because, being in pecuniary difficulties, he was anxious to
          find more remunerative employment. Her letters, which he always looked for with almost
          feverish eagerness, at this time keep _Die Wage_ before his eyes by every device which the
          ingenuity and perseverance of an anxious woman can suggest. She entreats and threatens,
          she scolds and teases, she sends him four long pages with nothing upon them except _Die
          Wage, Die Wage._</p>

        <p>But she is often quite as anxious to distract and amuse him, to prevent him from
          over-exerting himself and to keep up his spirits. When he is taken seriously ill at a
          distance from her, she grieves that she is not able to look after him, has once actually
          made up her mind to hazard her reputation by going to him; she knows very well that if she
          does, people will no longer believe that what unites them is only friendship.</p>

        <p>It was in reality a feeling midway between friendship and love, for which no name exists.
          After Jeannette's death there was found among her papers an ordinary _Gesindebüchlein der
          freien Stadt Frankfurt_,[1] on the cover of which Börne had written his name, with the
          usual particulars. On its first page stands:</p>

        <p>Took service With whom? For how In what Left service long capacity? when?</p>

        <p>15. Jan. 1818 Frau Wohl. For ever. As friend. On the day of his death.</p>

        <p>There could be no more laconic expression of a volun<pb n="79"/>tary lifelong devotion.
          And the last words were literally fulfilled, for it was on Jeannette's face that the dying
          man's last look rested, and to her that he spoke his last words: "You have given me much
          happiness."</p>

        <p>Jeannette Wohl's portrait, which Börne declared to be a good one, shows us a woman with a
          longish face, regular, pleasing features, a high forehead, an expressive, beautifully
          formed mouth, and bright, kindly eyes; the firm chin indicates energy. Her voice is said
          to have been remarkably sweet. Hers was not a particularly original, and still less was it
          a productive mind; she was one of those women who can merge their own individuality in
          that of the man to whom they are devoted. To Börne, the author, her natural feminine
          capacity for inspiring a man with confidence in himself was invaluable; she was as much
          offended by any disparaging remark he made on the subject of his own ability or deserts,
          as if it had been made by another. She was comfort and consolation to him in human form.
          In her he had a being on whom he could place absolute reliance, to whom he could confide
          everything without the slightest fear of ever being misunderstood, far less betrayed, and
          to whom he could address all his literary efforts. She was to him an epitome of the ideal
          public for whom he wrote.</p>

        <p>In one of his confidential letters he writes that his feeling for Jeannette is described
          in the following passage from _La Nouvelle Heloïse_: "C'est cette union touchante d'une
          sensibilité si vive et d'une inaltérable douceur; c'est cette pitié si tendre à tous les
          maux d'autrui; c'est cet esprit juste et ce goût exquis qui tirent leur pureté de celle de
          l'âme; ce sont, en un mot, les charmes des sentiments, bien plus que ceux de la personne,
          que j'adore en vous." And we learn, from a letter of Jeannette's written in 1833, after
          this friendship had lasted seventeen years, that the attraction he exercised was at least
          equal to that which he experienced. She describes as a sort of _idée fixe_, or chronic
          ailment, the excitement that takes possession of her about the time when the mail may be
          expected. The day she writes, she had been obliged to give up her usual occupations and
          lie on the sofa, and when at last the letter arrives, she weeps for joy.</p>

        <p><pb n="80"/> She looks after his money matters, calculates the payments due to him, draws
          his police pension for him; at one time, when he has a great longing to travel in Italy,
          but cannot do it for want of means, she takes a lottery ticket, in the hope of winning the
          necessary sum, and when she is disappointed in this, wishes to sell her piano, but finds
          she cannot raise the required amount in this way either.[2] And all this without the
          incentive of love, in the narrower sense of the word. Her friends believed her to be
          capable of doing even more for him. At the time that it first occurred to her that Börne
          ought to publish his letters to her, she expressed to a cousin the naïve doubt if it were
          possible to publish letters before the death of the person to whom they were addressed, to
          which the cousin replied that she had not the least doubt that Jeannette was quite ready
          to let herself be buried if it would do any good to Dr. Börne.</p>

        <p>They often travelled together, and sometimes, it would seem, lived together; but the
          nature of their relation to each other never altered. It is probable that at one time, in
          the first stage of their friendship, Börne tried to persuade Jeannette to marry him, but
          her fear lest the relation existing between them might lose its charm by being turned into
          an ordinary, everyday marriage, a fear which Börne himself afterwards shared, proved an
          insurmountable obstacle. Considering that they were both free to dispose of themselves as
          they would, it seems hardly possible that their relation could have remained what it was
          for all these years without the existence of some slight, it might be almost unconscious,
          physical antipathy on her side, or on both sides. An outward hindrance to their union
          undoubtedly existed in the difference of their creeds. Börne belonged to the Christian,
          Jeannette to the Jewish confession; her orthodox mother was strongly opposed to her
          becoming a Christian, and in those days great difficulties were placed in the way of mixed
          marriages. But this was not the main difficulty. Jeannette herself writes that to marry
          Börne <pb n="81"/> would require "more courage and more self-confidence" than she
          possesses. And in this instance we see the man whom we knew in his youth as the passionate
          lover, and who all his life long suffered from a jealous disposition, quickly rise to the
          height of pure devotion; he constantly urges Jeannette, for her own sake, to marry a man
          worthy of her, and make a happy home.</p>

        <p>In 1821, in answer to the words just quoted, Börne writes: "I swear to you by Almighty
          God that, ardent and often expressed as my desire to make you mine may have been, it has
          always been more of your happiness than of my own that I have thought. My love for you
          makes me happy; what more could marriage give me, since it could not increase that love?
          Though I did not confess it to you, I always dreaded that marriage might drag down our
          beautiful friendship to the level of everyday, sordid reality. But I thought, what I still
          think, that _you_ would gain something by it, and this would indirectly have increased my
          happiness. So there is nothing to prevent you from marrying another man; you and I should
          lose nothing by that."</p>

        <p>Strange to say, the truth of this last, audacious assertion was put to the proof. At a
          somewhat advanced age, Jeannette actually fell in love with and married a man much younger
          than herself. It was their mutual admiration for Börne that brought the couple together,
          and in Jeannette's answer to the letter in which Straus asks her to marry him there is a
          long reference to Börne, so enlightening in its simple eloquence that it cannot be
          dispensed with in this estimate of his character as a man and as an author. She
          writes:</p>

        <p>"The Doctor has no one in the world but me; I am to him friend, sister, all that these
          words convey of kindliness, friendliness, sympathy. Can you grudge this to him, to whom
          life has given nothing else, and who has reconciled himself to his fate ... is even
          contented with it.... Ican think of no other possibility than that the Doctor should be
          free to come to us when, where, and for as long as he chooses; for altogether, if he
          wishes. I can't say _you_, my <pb n="82"/> heart is too full; canst _thou_ think anything
          else possible? If so, then all is different from what I thought. I!--we!--dream of
          deserting a man like the Doctor--why, he would be a ruined, a lost man! I would rather
          give up everything, rather die, than have that upon my conscience; I could not do it, even
          if I would.... I am trembling all over, and as pale as death from writing even these few
          words on the subject. For nothing agitates me so deeply as the very thought of such
          treason, of such infidelity to such fidelity. As long as I live, till I draw my last
          breath, I shall feel for Börne the love of a daughter for her father, of a sister for her
          brother, of a friend for a friend. If you do not understand, cannot grasp the situation,
          do not know me well enough--then all is over, all is night. I can write no more. But no
          more is necessary. I am thankful this is over."[3]</p>

        <p>Events proved that Straus thoroughly entered into Jeannette's feelings, indeed shared
          them. He, too, became a faithful friend to Börne. For five months in the summer of 1833
          Börne lived with them in Switzerland. They then removed, for his sake, to Paris; where
          they all lived together from the end of 1833 till his death, spending the summers at
          Auteuil. The one person who permitted himself to make disparaging comment on this
          arrangement was Heine, in that unfortunate passage in his book, _Ludwig Börne_, which led
          to the duel in which he was wounded by Straus. Heine afterwards, of his own free will,
          expunged the passage. But in anger and grief at the harm done to his reputation by this
          work on Börne, he was heard to call Jeannette the baleful woman who, on his triumphal
          progress as Germany's chosen poet, crossed his path, prophesying evil, and caused him to
          start back and drop his laurel wreath in the dirt.[4]</p>

        <p>It is certain that Jeannette never forgave Heine his unpardonable molestation; yet no one
          could have been less of a Megæra. What Börne once wrote to her, joking, as he <pb n="83"/>
          often did, on the subject of her faulty orthography, was almost true, namely, that in the
          letter he had received that day there were more faults than she had herself, for there was
          one.</p>

        <p>In her opinions we can follow the different steps of Börne's political development. After
          the Revolution of July she, too, is a radical democrat. In the expressive words of her
          biographer, Schnapper-Arndt: "She most frequently thinks with Börne, at times in
          opposition to him, never without him. But she does seem to be perfectly independent in her
          passionate sympathy with the revolt of the Polish nation, a feeling so strong that it
          leads her to heap reproaches on Börne for being capable at such a moment of writing about
          the Italian opera in Paris. The Polish scythemen, the liberty of Poland--nothing else is
          worthy to be mentioned along with this. It seems to her that every one must help; she
          gives her own most cherished possessions to the cause; and nothing can exceed her shame
          when Germany shows itself indifferent to it, nothing her joy when she can send Börne
          proofs of the fact that a storm of sympathy and enthusiasm is sweeping over the
          country."</p>

        <p>[1] The "service book" which German employés are required to keep.</p>

        <p>[2] On this occasion Börne writes: "Love has affected the reason of many a human being,
          but I never heard of human kindness doing so. No one was capable of this but you.... It is
          well that you have never found the man of your heart--you cannot even stand wine mixed
          with water."</p>

          Schnapper-Arndt's article: _Jeannette Straus-Wohl und ihre Beziehungen zu Börne.

        <p>BÖRNE</p>

        <p>The progress of the insurrection in Poland, which lasted from the winter of 1830 till the
          summer of 1831, was followed with lively sympathy by almost all the nations of Europe. All
          knew that the struggle in Poland was deciding whether absolutism or national liberty was
          to prevail in the Europe of the future. The movements of the combatants were eagerly
          noted; every victory of the Poles was hailed with popular rejoicing, every defeat was
          heard of with sorrow. Towards the close of the struggle, when it became evident that the
          Poles, unaided, could not triumph, numerous appeals were addressed by German subjects to
          their respective governments, urging them to assist Poland. The Germans then possessed the
          quality, which Bismarck afterwards laid to their charge as a fault--a fault of which he
          has cured them--of being almost more interested in the welfare of other nations than in
          their own, to the extent even of desiring that welfare when it could only be purchased by
          some surrender of power on the part of Germany.</p>

        <p>When all was over with the Poles, the Germans tried to give proof of their sympathy by
          showing as much hospitality as possible to the Polish refugees on their wanderings through
          Central Europe to France. They everywhere met with a warm reception; a committee was
          appointed in almost every German town to collect money for them and help them on their
          journey. Jeannette Wohl's letters to Börne at this time contain many significant details.
          She tells that a number of Polish officers who came by water from Hanau to
          Frankfort-on-Main were escorted all the way by enthusiasts, that bands played and salutes
          were fired as they entered the town, and that, they were carried shoulder high through the
          crowd. When bands of Poles march <pb n="85"/> through the town, all heads are uncovered as
          they pass. The town defrays their expenses at the hotels. A wounded Polish officer, who
          dies at one of the hotels, is followed to his grave by thousands, including the city
          militia. A goldsmith sets a splinter of iron taken from the wound of another Polish
          officer in the shape of a little sword, and presents it to him.</p>

        <p>With the fall of Poland the bulwark which protected Germany from the influence of the
          Russian autocracy was broken down. The defeat of the Poles was a defeat for the champions
          of liberty in every country. The shock was a violent one.</p>

        <p>A man who lived at Bremerhafen at the time when the infernal machine devised by the
          wholesale murderer, Thomas, exploded, tells how, immediately after he had heard the report
          of the fearful explosion, a torn, bleeding hand flew in at his open window and fell upon
          the desk at which he sat writing. Something of the same kind happened to German authors'
          when Warsaw capitulated. Shattered Poland's dissevered hand fell without warning upon
          their desks. Heine writes in 1831, in his introduction to Kahldorf's book on the
          aristocracy: "I feel while I am writing as if the blood shed at Warsaw were gushing from
          my paper, and as if the Berlin officers' and diplomatists' shouts of joy were ringing in
          my ears."</p>

        <p>The three Powers that had divided Poland determined to take immediate advantage of the
          victory to overpower dismayed European Liberalism, and this in four countries at the same
          time--in Germany, where the Bundestag was to inaugurate, and Prussia and Austria to carry
          out, a still more energetic reaction; in Italy, which was once more to be occupied by
          Austria; in Portugal, where Don Miguel was to be supported against his brother; and in the
          Netherlands, where the King of Holland was to be assisted in his struggle with rebellious
          Belgium.</p>

        <p>Immediately after the suppression of the Polish revolt, a note was addressed by the
          Cabinet of St. Petersburg to the German governments, in which Russia advised them to keep
          the revolutionary tendencies in their respective countries <pb n="86"/> in check, and
          offered them her assistance in doing so. The censorship at once became more severe, and
          many Liberal newspapers and periodicals were suppressed. The Chambers of the South German
          States protested, and the utterances of the Liberal press, in spite of all warnings and
          threats, became more violent and reckless from day to day. The general belief had hitherto
          been that it was the desire of the sovereigns to meet the wishes of their people, but that
          they were held back by their advisers. Now this belief fell to the ground. The conviction
          became general that the unification of all the German countries in one constitutional,
          strongly democratic State was at hand. Politically short-sighted, and imbued with all
          manner of optimistic ideas, the general public were unable to believe that such a movement
          as that originated by the Revolution of July could exhaust itself without any political
          result. The champions of Liberalism had preached "progress" as a religion, and people had
          arrived at the belief that progress must inevitably be victorious, and that each attempt
          at reaction would actually work for good in the end.</p>

        <p>Such was the state of public opinion at the time of the publication of the first volume
          of Börne's _Letters from Paris_, which gained him great popularity. They were promptly
          suppressed. (November 1831.) This suppression, and the abuse heaped on the author by his
          opponents, added to the sensation which the bold language of the book had created.</p>

        <p>In these letters, Börne's style is only occasionally humorous, whereas in his earlier
          writings it invariably was so. We seldom find the quiet, resigned sort of humour
          distinguishing, for instance, his characteristic description of his capture by night and
          his imprisonment in Frankfort in 1820: "I was refused a boot-jack _Stiefelknecht_ = boot
          servant or slave), that the distressing symbol of servitude might not be always before my
          eyes. I was only allowed to use knife and fork in the presence of a warder, in case I
          should injure myself. Paper, pen, and ink were granted me only after repeated entreaties,
          and paper in restricted quantity; they were afraid my health might suffer from my sitting
          still too much. Every evening a warder came <pb n="87"/> with a lantern to examine the
          stove and see that it did not smoke, as smoke might be injurious to my fine eyes; he also
          examined the grating in front of the window, to make sure that thieves could not break in,
          &amp;c, &amp;c."</p>

        <p>It is only at the commencement of his stay in Paris, while he is kept in a state of
          constant elation by the supposed attainment of great political results, that he still
          jests lightly and freely (as, for example, on the subject of the many Princes Henry of
          Reuss, Greiz, and Schleiz, who are now being punished by the revolution in Gera for all
          the agony the committing to memory of their respective numbers cost him at school); the
          jesting tone soon vanishes from his letters, and the striking, convincing similes are all
          that remains of his old style.</p>

        <p>His chief feeling, when he thinks of his Fatherland, is shame. In the Days of July,
          Englishmen and Dutchmen, Spaniards and Italians, Poles and Greeks, helped to fight for the
          liberty of France, which means the liberty of all nations; but no Germans were there. With
          its administration of justice, its censorship, and its guilds, Germany will soon be the
          antiquarian museum of Europe. But more obnoxious to him than anything else is the German
          spirit of loyalty and humility. The Spaniards, the Italians, the Russians, and all the
          others are slaves; the people that speak the German tongue are lackeys. Slavery only makes
          men unhappy, it does not degrade them; servitude degrades. (January 25th 1831.) At an
          international dinner in Paris, when speeches were being made by Liberals of every
          nationality, shame for his country prevented him from getting up to speak on its behalf.
          He thought: These Poles, these Spaniards, who have spoken, represent their country. "But
          what do I represent? what achievements do I recall? I stand alone, I am a lackey, wearing,
          like all other Germans, the livery of Count Münch-Bellinghausen." (14th December
          1831.)</p>

        <p>Closely connected with this feeling of shame is an irritability, an inclination to be
          indignant with every one and everything, which gives a certain impression of weakness, of
          failing health. Everything, great and small, is "infuriating" <pb n="88"/> --from the
          long-suffering of the nations and their slowness to rise in revolt, to a rude letter from
          Spontini to the Berlin orchestra; from the proposal to grant Louis Philippe a liberal
          civil-list, to the deficiencies of an encyclopædia.[1] As time goes on he actually seeks
          out provocations. We come upon such expressions as: "I am cheerful, for I have been
          angry;" or "You cannot give me greater pleasure than by reporting cases of German
          stupidity to me."</p>

        <p>But in the years immediately following the Revolution of July, shame and anger are
          drowned in a storm-tossed sea of hope. Börne feels as absolutely certain of the speedy
          approach of a universal conflagration, followed by the victory of liberty, as the first
          Christians felt of the immediate end of the world, followed by the day of judgment, with
          its decree of salvation for the elect, and damnation for the hard of heart. He is in a
          state of excitement which makes it impossible for him to be the chronicle-writer of his
          time; he feels that it is his mission to be its prophet, in twelve long volumes, if need
          be.[2]</p>

        <p>Alas, it is only the pessimistic prophets who, sooner or later, always prove to be right.
          And Börne was an optimistic prophet, an enthusiast, naïvely and incorrigibly given to
          believing in what he wished. Events in France have inspired him with the belief that the
          death-knell of the reaction has sounded. He seriously reproaches himself for being ashamed
          to kiss such and such a Frenchman's hand, "the hand which has burst our fetters, and given
          to us serfs the accolade of knighthood." (17th September 1830.) He knows that the end is
          at hand. On the occasion of Charles X.'s laying some foundation-stone, Börne remarks <pb
            n="89"/> that it is high time for kings to stop making themselves ridiculous by laying
          the foundation-stones of buildings. It would be more suitable for them now to nail the
          last tile on the roofs. For the time is at hand when the royal cooks will ask each other:
          "For whom shall we be preparing dinner to-morrow?" (19th September 1830.) A month after
          this, being asked what he thinks likely to happen, he expresses his firm conviction that
          the following spring will see the whole of Europe in conflagration. He pities the
          diplomatists, positively feels sympathy for them. When the Polish insurrection breaks out,
          he does not believe, taking the great strength of the Russians into consideration, that it
          will be as easy for the Poles as for the Belgians to attain their object, but is sure that
          they will succeed in the end. And like a refrain recurs the assertion that, one after
          another, all the countries of Europe will emancipate themselves, Germany alone remaining
          in its miserable condition. And yet at times he foresees the salvation of Germany. When
          the cholera is raging in Moscow, he understands its signification, sees the finger of God
          in it: "This is once more the naked hand of God. The Powers are prevented from gathering
          together great armies, and if, in spite of everything, they persist in doing so ... I have
          a presentiment--no, it is more than that, I _know_ that the cholera will do what as yet
          nothing else has had the power to do, it will rouse the most procrastinating and timid
          nation on the face of the earth to show courage." (3rd November 1830.) His confidence in
          the ultimate success of the Poles increased, supporting itself on the theory that those
          always win who have no choice but victory or death. At the close of the year 1830 he is
          certain that the ruling sovereigns are doomed; his "modest" New Year's wish for his friend
          and himself is, that 1831 maybe a better year for them than it will be for emperors and
          kings. He will have to say to his servant: "If an emperor comes, keep your eye upon him,
          and don't leave him alone in my room." And he ends by assuring him that in 1831 a dozen of
          eggs will be of more value than a dozen princes. (26th December 1830.)</p>

        <p>On the 8th of January 1831, he maintains that if only <pb n="90"/> the Poles can avoid a
          pitched battle, the Russians, "powerful as they are, are lost." And he still takes it for
          granted that the French will take up arms in defence of Poland: France would be insane
          (_ganz von Sinnen_) if she did not take advantage of this unique opportunity to weaken the
          power of Russia. On the 11th of February he is perfectly positive that there will be war.
          He himself has never doubted it for a single day, and many who would not believe it
          before, have come round to his opinion. Outbursts of rejoicing are frequent. The Poles
          have once more received help from above; there is "tolerably certain" news of rebellion
          having broken out in several Russian provinces. On the 6th of March, when things are
          looking extremely bad for Poland, he has another false piece of news to rejoice over. A
          Parisian commercial house has received intelligence that the Russian forces have been
          scattered, and also that the Lithuanians are in revolt behind them, "which will decide
          matters." He is jubilant. From this time onwards, tyrants will be threatened with the
          Poles, as naughty children are threatened with the chimney-sweep. Nicholas boasted that he
          would roll the Poles together like a ball of yarn; the ball has turned into a bomb, which
          has blown him to pieces! Börne actually has visions of Paris illuminated on the occasion.
          On the 18th of March, when it is no longer possible to believe in the truth of the
          favourable news, he is already mounted on a new chimera. All is well; for in France itself
          a great change is impending: "Matters here are in such a position, that I daily, nay
          hourly, expect a revolution. Things cannot continue as they are for four weeks
          longer...."</p>

        <p>It is undoubtedly a strong proof of Börne's honesty that he allowed Jeannette to publish
          his letters as they came from his pen, unedited, without any suppression or modification
          of prophetic passages to which facts speedily gave the lie. But their perusal does not
          increase our faith in him as a politician. The contradiction between what is prophesied
          and what happens is at times so marked as to be comical. On the 25th of December he is in
          despair because of Lafayette's indecision: Lafayette is <pb n="91"/> omnipotent, can bring
          about whatever he pleases, has only to threaten to give up the command of the National
          Guard to reduce the king, the ministers, and the Chambers to immediate submission. Next
          day, the 26th of December, he announces shortly that Lafayette has been deposed from his
          command, without so much as a dog barking. Strange, says the reader to himself, that such
          an eager politician should never have felt it a necessity to study the science of
          politics, in order to be able to form his conclusions with some understanding of the
          subject--that he should have been perfectly satisfied to produce ephemeral journalistic
          effusions, of value to-day, to-morrow cast into the oven.</p>

        <p>What constantly misleads Börne is that optimism of his, which has been already alluded
          to, an optimism at once naïve and fanatical, which perpetually discovers reasons why the
          evil that happens is at the same time the best thing that could happen. In March 1831, he
          trembles for the Poles, and declares that he is prepared for the worst. "But," he
          continues, "such a victory would be more disastrous for the Russians than all their
          defeats. The arrogant Nicholas would become presumptuous, and believe that he could
          dispose of France as easily as of Poland." What a ground of comfort! Börne goes on hoping
          for a revolution in Paris which shall shake all thrones. But it does not come. He
          presently discovers that this quietness of France is more dangerous for the crowned heads
          than anything else could be. On the 30th of November 1831, he writes: "For forty years
          France has been the crater of Europe. When that crater ceases to shoot forth flames, no
          throne in Europe will be safe for one night.... Nothing could have been so disastrous for
          the monarchs as the fall of Warsaw. They have ruined a miracle, and therefore now believe
          themselves capable of working miracles." In other words: A revolution in Paris is good, no
          revolution is still better. The victory of Poland would have been the ruin of the
          monarchs; the fall of Poland is more fatal for them still.</p>

        <p>At the bottom of all this is Börne's very remarkable, implicit faith in God, which is but
          rarely disturbed by the <pb n="92"/> doubts of his ever active brain. The formula to which
          he almost always has recourse when he needs comfort is, that he trusts in God. Nicholas
          advances against the Poles with an overwhelming force; Börne "trusts in God." It is, as a
          matter of fact, only the Polish nobility who have risen in revolt, but Börne "trusts in
          the wisdom of God and the stupidity of his so-called representatives." He himself is, he
          declares, wiser than all the rest in France, as he was wiser than the rest in Germany;
          why? Because he "believes in God and nature," while the others believe in men and
          politics.</p>

        <p>Yet at times his faith wavers. We saw how at first he rejoiced over the cholera, saw the
          finger of God in it, felt that it would drive even the Germans to revolution. Only two
          months later (19th January 1831) he describes its actual effect, the manner in which it is
          paralysing the nations and aiding in the demolition of such liberty as still exists. At
          first he wrote: "What nothing else has been able to do, the cholera will do;" now it is
          the exact opposite: "What no Emperor of Russia, no devil could prevent, the cholera
          prevents." And he who saw in that plague "God's naked hand," now exclaims: "And the
          priests would have us believe that this is a judgment of God!" Nine months later (25th
          November) he gets out of the difficulty with a witty, thoughtless joke: "It is not often
          that God sends a heavenly commission of justice down to earth to investigate into the
          stewardship of his representatives, and so far, when such a thing has happened, it has not
          improved matters. The heavenly emissaries are out of their element on earth; they make
          mistakes, they even allow themselves to be bribed. We saw this lately, in the case of the
          Asiatic cholera, which punished the oppressed in place of the oppressors. God only helps
          those who help themselves."[3]</p>

        <p>Once only, when the fall of Poland is evidently at hand (5th March 1831), we feel that
          Börne's faith in his system is seriously shaken. When the Russians are getting the upper
          hand, he, as usual, makes free use of his favourite words--God, the devil, &amp;c. He
          comes to the conclusion <pb n="93"/> that "not even the wisdom of God, nothing but the
          stupidity of the devil can save Poland now." And then he interrupts himself with a
          question: "But is there a God at all? My heart does not doubt it yet, but one's brain
          feels bewildered enough at times. And even if he does exist, of what use is an eternal God
          to mortal man? Were he mortal like us ... he would take account of time and life, would
          not delay justice so long, would not wait to pay to future generations that which was
          their forefathers' due. Liberty can and will triumph, sooner or later; but why not now? It
          may triumph the very day after the fall of Poland; and that would be enough to break one's
          heart.... Can there be a God? Is this justice? We loathe cannibals, stupid savages, who
          only eat the flesh of their enemies. But we are reconciled to a far worse cannibalism--to
          the torturing, slaughtering, hewing asunder of the present, body and soul, with its joys
          and its happiness, its wishes and its hopes, to satisfy the appetite of the
          future."[4]</p>

        <p>A few days later, however, he returns to his accustomed faith in God and to that optimism
          over which no disappointments can prevail.</p>

        <p>Here and there in these letters we come upon sheer political twaddle, such as the
          fantasies on the consequences of the revolt in Hanover, and here and there on proofs of a
          positively foolish credulity, as, for example, when Börne allows himself to be persuaded
          that it is Metternich who has instigated the disturbances in South Germany in order that
          he may take possession of Bavaria while the troops are occupied; and again, that it is
          Louis Philippe's secret intention to reinstate the dynasty of Charles X. on the
          throne.[5]</p>

        <p>But frequently too we come upon utterances that show real political sagacity, a natural
          capacity for grasping a situation, and an unusual gift of prevision.</p>

        <p>On the 9th of November 1830, only four months after the Revolution, Börne already
          perceives that all that has happened amounts to no more than this, that the industrial
          magnates, those who understand nothing but "fear and <pb n="94"/> money," have come into
          power. And he is quite certain that, since this Revolution has not attained its object,
          those in power refusing to see anything in it but a change of dynasty, a new revolution is
          unavoidable, "and may be expected without fail." A week later, with correct appreciation
          of the facts, and logical deduction, he explains how events will follow on one another: As
          these merchants and manufacturers, who for fifteen years have been declaiming against
          aristocracy, have hardly got into power before they endeavour to form a new aristocracy,
          of monied men, of adventurers, not based like the old on a principle, but upon privileges
          conferred by the possession of property; the French people, with their passion for
          equality, will, the next time they make a revolution, attack that which is now the
          foundation of privilege, namely, property; and this process will be accompanied by such
          horrors as no previous revolution has witnessed. Börne, we observe, has a prevision of
          socialism as a power; he prophesies the Commune. A year later (1st December 1831) he feels
          so certain how things will go that he writes: "I so plainly foresee the great war between
          the poor and the rich that I feel as if we were in the middle of it now;" and at this
          period, in spite of his strong moral bias, he has come to the conclusion that the first
          thing to be aimed at is the support of right by might. If this is not practicable, then
          all that can be done is to touch men's hearts, to gain them for the good cause by working
          upon their feelings, and to pursue tyranny with ridicule, hate, and contempt. It is of no
          use whatever to be simply honest, to have the right on one's side. No; "their honesty is
          their bane. They imagine that the main thing is to be, and to prove that they are, right.
          They talk of liberty as a barrister would talk of some piece of property. As if it were
          reasons that were wanted here!" (1st February 1831.)</p>

        <p>The man who shows himself to us in these letters, is, after all, a political enthusiast,
          a lover of liberty, rather than a statesman. He not only loves the common people but, like
          Rousseau, he has a true admiration for those who have not been "spoiled" by wealth or
          education; and this admiration <pb n="95"/> goes hand in hand with a steadily increasing
          hatred of all the legitimate sovereigns and princes of Europe, which, when Börne casts all
          moderation from him along with his illusions, turns into veritable nihilism. "To think
          that ten yards of hempen cord would suffice to give the world peace, happiness, and
          quiet."[6] The peoples--the sovereigns,--the peoples--the sovereigns; it was between these
          poles that the pendulum of Börne's political thought incessantly swung; they were the
          poles of the political thought of the time. And it was natural enough that he should stop
          short at this antithesis, because he was essentially a democrat, such a confirmed democrat
          that, as he himself plainly tells us, he took no interest whatever in the study of the
          individual human being. It was as much of a nuisance to him to have to inquire into the
          peculiarities distinguishing one human being from another, as it was to have to decipher
          extremely minute handwriting. He preferred to occupy himself with humanity in the mass and
          with books. (3rd November 1830.) It is no wonder that we miss in him the delicate
          psychological insight which we look for in a great writer. To compensate for this
          deficiency we have the sympathy with whole nations, with whole classes, with a wide circle
          of readers, which enables an author to electrify a public, and ensures popularity during
          his lifetime even to a peculiarly audacious writer occupying a peculiarly precarious
          position.</p>

        <p>Not that Börne is unjust or prejudiced in his judgment of individuals. On the contrary,
          he shows the calm benevolence of superior intelligence; though he also undoubtedly at
          times evinces a real middle-class antipathy to what is over-aristocratic, and
          corresponding indulgence towards what is commonplace. When De Musset appears, he is at
          once struck by a kinship with Heine which surprises him in a Frenchman. He promptly
          recognises, even over-estimates Berlioz's genius, and every one knows how neglected and
          misunderstood Berlioz was. Prince Pückler he criticises appreciatively, without any
          warmth, but with a proper discernment of his merits; only he cannot understand how it <pb
            n="96"/> was possible for any one to believe that Pückler's bright, but essentially
          unpoetical letters, could have been written by Heine. As regards Heine himself, it is for
          long only his worship of Napoleon that is distinctly antipathetic to Börne, who
          appreciates, nay admires him in every other respect.</p>

        <p>There is something suggestive in Börne's sincere admiration for Paul de Kock, in the warm
          appreciation with which he mentions him, and the zest with which he perseveringly reads
          eight volumes of his novels on end. It is their naïve and faithful representation of the
          life of the Parisian _petit bourgeois_ that seems to Börne so admirable. He goes the
          length, though half in jest, of praising De Kock's philosophy of life, and on this hardly
          suitable occasion mounts his old hobby, and writes: "Though he does not, like Goethe in
          _Wilhelm Meister_, serve up didactic letters with truffles, he gives us good strong
          philosophy dressed in bourgeois fashion." (3rd March 1831.) Paul de Kock exalted at the
          expense of Goethe!</p>

        <p>This sort of criticism says little for Börne's æsthetic sense. Of his political sagacity
          convincing proof is given by his pronouncements on Talleyrand. In 1830 he at once feels
          quite confident that Talleyrand will serve France well in London, and does not allow his
          confidence to be shaken by the Parisians' hatred of that diplomatist. He sees the
          absurdity of the loud complaint of the Liberal newspapers that Talleyrand, as one of the
          framers of the Peace of Vienna, is certain to support the Holy Alliance. He comprehends
          that neither the Holy Alliance nor anything else is holy to Talleyrand. And long
          afterwards he again refers to the unreasonableness of the accusation brought against that
          sagacious diplomatist of having served and betrayed every government in turn, acutely
          remarking that he did not betray governments, he only deserted them, and that not until
          they were dead. What Börne reads in Talleyrand's hard face is necessity, cast as it were
          in bronze.</p>

        <p>But the chief cause of the leniency of Börne's judgments is to be sought, not in his
          intellect, but in his heart, in the tenderness of his nature, in the strong bias towards
          kindly <pb n="97"/> interpretation, which is not contradicted by his many violent,
          inconsiderate utterances; for these themselves, closely examined, prove to be but
          expressions of his love to his kind. He was a loving-hearted man, and in so far a
          Christian by nature, by instinct. This is the explanation of his conversion to
          Christianity. The reproach of hypocrisy in his case is a foolish one; his conception of
          Christianity may not have been profound, but he acted from honest, independent conviction.
          He became a Christian because he was a democrat and a humanitarian. To him Christianity
          was not simply a continuation and supplement of Judaism, it was rather the religion of
          humanity, and more especially "the religion of all poor devils." Every man who loved his
          kind was in Börne's eyes a Christian. Christianity was moreover to him the religion of
          liberty, especially in its Catholic form; for it was as Catholicism that it had destroyed
          the world-empire of the Romans. In the ardent love of liberty of these Poles with whom he
          has so much sympathy, he sees a proof of the liberalising power of Catholicism.[7]</p>

        <p>Börne does not personally believe in the dogmas of Christianity, or consider that faith
          is its essence; yet any attack on these dogmas is most repugnant to him. He sneers at
          Saint-Simonism because of its antagonism to the Christian religion, and he considers
          Strauss's _Life of Jesus_ to be not only a useless, but a mischievous book. All this makes
          it easy to understand how it was possible for him, in the last years of his life, to be
          completely carried away by a democratic Catholic like Lamennais, whose _Paroles d'un
          Croyant_, an attempt to blend Liberalism with religion, he translated and overrated.
          Religious Radicalism, as here expressed, was the magic formula to which the free and the
          locked-up powers of his own soul responded.</p>

        <p>In the course of the first volumes of the _Letters from Paris_, Börne, following the
          general trend of Oppositionist feeling <pb n="98"/> in Germany, progressed from enthusiasm
          for constitutionalism to hope of revolution. In April 1832, not six months after their
          publication, one of the leaders of the Opposition, Dr Siebenpfeiffer, issued a general
          invitation to all the different German nationalities to attend a great national festival,
          to be held at the castle of Hambach, near Neustadt on the Haardt, on the 27th of May, the
          anniversary of the concession of the Bavarian constitution. It was to be a festival of
          brotherhood for all whose desire and aim was the regeneration of Germany. This festival,
          however, seemed so suspicious to the government of Rhenish Bavaria, that it was forbidden;
          strangers were prohibited from visiting Neustadt or its environs from the 26th to the 28th
          of May, and any assemblage of more than five persons in the streets or other public places
          was forbidden. These prohibitions excited such general discontent that the authorities
          were obliged to withdraw them.</p>

        <p>People streamed to the festival from every point of the compass. Almost every German
          country sent representatives--the majority, of course, being inhabitants of the Palatinate
          itself. Even Frenchmen were there in large numbers, and Poles naturally were not lacking.
          The assembly numbered about thirty thousand in all.</p>

        <p>Börne, who came from Paris, was the most fêted guest. His journey to Neustadt was a sort
          of triumphal procession. He was cheered everywhere. Torchlight processions and serenades
          were the order of the day.</p>

        <p>He writes from Freiburg; "You have no idea what an impression my _Letters from Paris_
          have made in Germany. I never expected anything like it myself. Meyer, Wurm, and others
          had given out, had printed, that I could never again show myself in Germany, because I
          should be turned out of all respectable society. Nice prophets they are! I have done
          nothing but receive homage ever since I arrived. My room is never empty. I often have not
          chairs enough for my visitors. At the Hambach festival all present desired to make my
          acquaintance. It was so fatiguing that it has made me ill. When I made my appearance on
          the street in Neustadt, shouts were heard <pb n="99"/> from the restaurants and from the
          passing carriages of: 'Hurrah for Börne! hurrah for the author of the _Letters from
          Paris!'_ The Heidelberg students serenaded me. All the patriots, Wirth and the rest,
          declared that the credit of the patriotic movement in Germany was due to me; I was first;
          the others all came after. Many, moved to tears, arid unable to speak for emotion,
          embraced me warmly. It has been the same thing here in Freiburg. The students came to my
          house in the evening, serenaded me, and shouted: 'Hurrah for the champion of German
          liberty!'... What will my critics say to this, those critics who called me a bad patriot?
          Public opinion does not allow itself to be misled." Absurdly enough, with all this
          enthusiasm, his watch was stolen at the Hambach festival.</p>

        <p>On the morning of the 27th of May, the enormous procession made its way from Neustadt to
          the ruins of the castle of Hambach. Every one wore black, red, and gold colours, and
          black, red, and gold flags were carried in front of the procession, the ranks of which
          were swelled by a great number of women, wearing black, red, and gold belts.
          Siebenpfeiffer and the Bavarian Liberal journalist, Wirth, were the principal speakers.
          They proclaimed the sovereignty of the people to be the foundation on which every state
          must rest, and declared that Germany would ere long be a republic. All the speeches made
          were violent, and all described the degradation of Germany as the work of her sovereigns,
          in combination with the aristocrats. Wirth proposed the toast (for which he had afterwards
          to do penance by a long imprisonment) of "The united free states of Germany," and
          "federated republican Europe," and shouted as he waved the sword of honour that had been
          presented to him: "Accursed, three times accursed be the rulers of Germany!" These words
          were re-echoed by part of the assembly; there were shouts of: "Down with kings and
          princes! To arms! To arms!"</p>

        <p>The participators in the Hambach festival had, however, no immediate, practical aim in
          view. Supposing the moment to have been favourable--a tolerably doubtful <pb n="100"/>
          supposition--they allowed it to pass without taking advantage of it.</p>

        <p>Heine writes humorously and bitterly: "I dare hardly tell the story, it seems so
          incredible, yet I have it from a reliable source, from a man who is an honest and truthful
          republican, and was himself a member of the committee at Hambach which deliberated on the
          impending revolution. This man told me in confidence that, when it came to the question of
          competence, to a dispute as to whether the patriots then assembled at Hambach were really
          competent to begin a revolution in the name of the whole of Germany, those who advised
          immediate action were outvoted, and the conclusion arrived at was that they were
          incompetent." Heine calls this the best story he has ever heard, good enough to make him
          forget all the troubles of this vale of tears, and even to cheer him after death in the
          dusky tedium of the realm of shades. Then he speaks words of comfort to kings and princes,
          tells them how it is quite unnecessary that they should imprison any more worthy citizens;
          they may sleep in peace; they are in no danger; the German revolution is still far off;
          the question of competence is not yet decided.[8]</p>

        <p>For many years after he made Heine's literary and personal acquaintance, Börne's feeling
          towards that author was a friendly one; he spoke of him with affection, gave him his full
          due as a poet, and more especially appreciated him as a great power in the service of
          universal emancipation. But their natures were too unlike to permit of his judgment being
          quite unprejudiced. From 1831 onwards we come upon spiteful references to Heine in the
          Letters. Although Börne was devoid of petty vanity, the frequent comparisons made between
          Heine and himself rankled in his mind, especially as, in the matter of ability and gifts,
          they were often to his disadvantage. And Heine's _Französische Zustände_ ("The Situation
          in France") offended and wounded him; its perusal roused in him a feeling of ill-humour to
          which he gave vent (in the last volume of the _Letters from Paris_) in cutting satire,
          which <pb n="101"/> struck Heine as it were from above, and, in the eyes of many readers,
          stamped him with the brand of political untrustworthiness.</p>

        <p>It was in reality the deep-seated antagonism between the natures of the two
          fellow-combatants that found vent on this occasion. Börne did not understand the real
          nature of the difference between himself and Heine. To him it seemed to be the difference
          between manly earnestness and boyish frivolity, or, taken in its highest aspect, between
          devotion to truth and devotion to form, to art. With accurate perception he detected and
          exposed some of the small puerilities and snobberies of which Heine, when dazzled by the
          tinsel of life, could at a time be guilty, and also some of his unjust mockeries of ideal
          endeavour clothed in clumsy or naïvely popular form. Börne detested the Rothschilds, by
          whom Heine was impressed and fascinated. Börne, who felt out of his element in
          drawing-rooms, was quite at home among democratic artisans, and in gatherings of German
          emigrants, no matter how wild the schemes they planned, or how unpractical the
          undertakings for which they collected money; Heine, on the contrary, was annoyed by the
          constant solicitations to support this or that democratic undertaking, was quite unsuited
          to be a member of the democratic fraternity, preferred, in spite of his revolutionary
          leanings, to keep himself to himself, and had no intention whatever of being on terms of
          hail fellow well met with any chance band of emigrant fellow-countrymen.</p>

        <p>In a letter dated the 25th of February 1833, Börne jeers at Heine for various things,
          amongst others for writing of the inhuman policy pursued by Austria for the last three
          hundred years as "sublime perseverance"; for calling King Louis of Bavaria, whom he
          afterwards so unmercifully satirised, "one of the noblest and most intellectual monarchs
          that ever sat upon a throne"; and for declaring it to be "courageous and admirable" of the
          Messrs. Rothschild to remain in Paris during the cholera, while he, at the same time,
          casts ridicule on the unpaid exertions of the German patriots. On these points, and
          others, Börne is right, but <pb n="102"/> nevertheless he shows no delicate discernment or
          profound comprehension of Heine's real character.</p>

        <p>In the case of Heine, as in the case of Goethe, he stood face to face with a genius he
          was unable to judge impartially, though he by no means wronged his restless contemporary
          to the same extent or in the same manner as he did his great predecessor.</p>

          to stop writing for a good half hour, and was infuriated beyond all bounds.)</p>

          write? The ground, the table, the desk, hand and heart tremble, shaken by the hurricane,
          history itself trembles.... A prophet I would be, throughout twelve volumes.</p>

        <p>For Heinrich Heine also, as already observed, the present moment in the development of
          the new German Empire is an unfavourable one. He is reproached with so much, that it is
          difficult to summarise. First there is his infatuation for France, and his supposed or
          real frivolity; then his un-German extraction and wit, his sentimentality, his foppery,
          his wantonness; and lastly, the defiant manner in which he parades his irreligion. New
          Germany is indifferent in religious matters, but tacitly so, and in the matter of morals
          it is thoroughly disciplined. In the Germany of to-day the highest virtues, truthfulness,
          independence, high spirit, and sensitiveness, are of much less account than dutifulness,
          correctness, social discipline, military smartness--_Schneidigkeit_, as it is called. In
          Heine's time the opposite was the case. No value was put on discipline. Piety counted for
          more than religion, humanity for more than patriotism. The best men of those days did not
          regard patriotism as an unqualified virtue; nor did they consider that justice ceased to
          be a virtue when shown to another nation.</p>

        <p>To an abstract Radical bent of mind there was added in Heine's case the hatred of
          Prussia, whose future he did not foresee, whose strength he did not realize--that strength
          of which Carlyle gives us the best idea in his delineation of the father of Frederick the
          Great, a strength which lay in the ability, by means of sober severity, to conquer chaos,
          crush all foolish opposition, and rule. Heine's was no undefined dislike, it was the
          Rhinelander's mortal enmity to Prussia. Read his lines to the Prussian eagle:</p>

        <p> "Du hässlicher Vogel! wirst du einst, Mir in die Hände fallen, So rupfe ich dir die
          Federn aus Und haue dir ab die Krallen.</p>

        <p><pb n="104"/> Du sollst mir dann in luft'ger Höh' Auf einer Stange sitzen Und ich rufe
          zum lustigen Schiessen herbei Die _rheinischen_ Bogenschützen."[1]</p>

        <p>At the Congress of Vienna, after repeatedly refusing, Prussia at last consented to take
          over the Rhine Provinces. Instead of the rounding off of her frontier in the east for
          which she had hoped, she thus acquired territory at a distance, and came to rule over a
          race of Germans totally unlike the Old-Prussians. This Rhine Province was the region
          where, in days gone by, the line of separation between Kelts and Germans lay. Most of it
          had been included in the Roman military province. At a later period the land came under
          priestly rule, which accounts for the fact that it was in no way influenced in the
          eighteenth century by the spirit of Frederick the Great. Old, decaying clericalism came
          here into direct contact with the French Revolution, and the propagators of the
          revolutionary ideas were joyfully welcomed.</p>

        <p>The Old-Prussian's feeling towards the Rhinelanders was the distrust of antipathy, a
          feeling the Rhinelanders returned with interest. At the Rhine the Prussians were, and
          continued to be strangers, unwelcome strangers. When he spoke of a son serving in the
          army, the Rhinelander said: "He is with the Prussians." The government official
          transferred from Berlin to Cologne or Düsseldorf put on airs, and disparaged everything,
          and the Rhinelander long regarded a transfer to one of the old Prussian provinces as a
          sort of exile to Siberia. Complaints were heard everywhere of Prussia's inability to gain
          the affections of the peoples she had conquered.[2]</p>

        <p>[Illustration: HEINRICH HEINE]</p>

        <p>Heinrich Heine was born near the close of the century at Düsseldorf, then capital of the
          duchy of Jülich-Cleve-Berg. For six years the town was garrisoned by French revolutionary
          troops. They took their departure in 1801, and Max Joseph of Pfalz-Zweibrücken became
          Grand Duke; but <pb n="105"/> in 1806 he was made King of Bavaria, and Joachim Murat was
          installed as Grand Duke in his stead. Only two years later Murat had to make way for the
          eldest son of the King of Holland, or, in reality, as the boy was not of age, for
          Napoleon, as his guardian. The country was now governed exactly according to the French
          pattern; serfdom, feudal law, and statute-labour were abolished, and complete religious
          liberty was proclaimed. This last innovation led to Napoleon's being revered by the Jewish
          population of the Rhine Provinces as their saviour from the oppression of a thousand
          years.</p>

        <p>There can be no doubt that the contact with the audacious, victorious Frenchmen of that
          day powerfully influenced Heine's mental development. His respect for traditional
          authority was early undermined. His natural wit was developed in the direction of what the
          French call _esprit_. The germs of his enthusiastic admiration for Napoleon were
          generated. That enthusiasm seems to us to-day to be an isolated phenomenon in the German
          literature of the century; in reality it was very far from being so.</p>

        <p>Let us go back to Wieland, and we shall find that he held Napoleon in the same high
          estimation, even before such an opinion had been justified by the events of history. In
          1798 he declares that France stands in need of a dictator, and that no one is fit for the
          post except General Bonaparte, then in Egypt. In 1800 he prophesies that Bonaparte will
          and must make himself king, and defends him against the attacks of the English newspapers.
          Napoleon, having been told of these prophecies, had a lengthy interview with Wieland at
          Erfurt in 1808.</p>

        <p>None of the great Germans at the end of the eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth
          century knew what national enmity meant. It was without a spark of any such feeling that
          Goethe, in the capacity of spectator, made the campaign of 1793 in France. Schiller valued
          his certificate of French citizenship, and believed that it might come to be of use to his
          children. Knebel, Goethe's friend, wished that he dared sing Napoleon's victories. Goethe
          himself looked on with complacency while Napoleon shattered the kingdom of <pb n="106"/>
          Frederick the Great into fragments; it is evident that he must have regarded that kingdom
          of Prussia as a passing phenomenon in the history of Germany. He had witnessed Napoleon's
          rise and victorious career, and had seen him suppress that anarchy which was so hateful to
          himself, the aristocrat and evolutionist. At last he made his personal acquaintance, saw
          him surrounded by his marshals, in an atmosphere of brightness, amiability, geniality,
          general irresistibility. The personal impression made upon him by Napoleon was such as to
          increase his previous admiration for him. Hence it was that even after the Russian
          campaign, even during the rehabilitation of Germany, Goethe continued to say: "It is all
          of no use; the man is too strong for them." It was not till all was over that he made a
          sort of compulsory amends by writing a play for the fête on the occasion of the peace.</p>

        <p>Goethe's valuation of Napoleon has been the subject of much discussion; less well known
          is the impression which the great Frenchman made on Hegel, who, as Heine's teacher and
          chosen philosopher, influenced him quite as much as Goethe. Hegel was born a subject of
          the small, despotically-ruled State of Würtemberg. He longed for a fatherland, but had
          never known what it was to have one, and in the beginning of the century he was so
          embittered by the situation in Germany, and roused to such anger and scorn by the
          political stupidity of his countrymen, that he, like Goethe, welcomed Napoleon with the
          unqualified enthusiasm of a cosmopolitan. He had spent his youth dreaming of a possible
          reconciliation of the real with the ideal, but had never come into contact with a real
          living power until Napoleon crossed his path and aroused his enthusiasm. It was said of
          Goethe that he took advantage of the distraction caused by the roar of the cannon at Jena
          to marry Christiane Vulpius without rousing remark; of Hegel it was said that he finished
          his work _Die Phænomenologie des Geistes_ ("Philosophy of Mind") in Jena itself, while the
          battle was raging. It is a fact that it was exactly at this time that he despatched the
          last pages of the work to his publisher; and there is a very striking contrast between his
          calm indifference to the <pb n="107"/> ruin of Prussia and his keen anxiety lest any of
          the precious packets of manuscript should be lost in transit at that unsettled time. A
          letter to his publisher, which accompanied one of the packets, bears the date of the
          battle.</p>

        <p>In the work, to which the finishing touches were put under such circumstances, Hegel
          expounded his theory of the development of the human mind with a curious mixture of
          historical and psychological argument. He maintained that humanity had now reached its
          goal, that such individual mortals as had attained to the highest degree of understanding,
          now possessed the insight of gods, that their lives, lives of far-reaching influence, were
          now simply the harmonious unfolding of an existence such as the Greeks imagined that of
          their gods to be, absolutely contented, absolutely reconciled. While Hegel was writing his
          concluding words, which are to the effect that history is but a play of the spirit that is
          conscious of itself as spirit, Napoleon drew rein at the gates of Jena.</p>

        <p>And Hegel saw him, and seeing him, rejoiced. "I have seen the emperor, that soul of the
          world," he writes from Jena. "It truly gives one a strange feeling to see one such single
          individual who, concentrated on a single point, sitting on his horse here in Jena,
          influences and rules the world. As far as the Prussians are concerned, nothing better
          could have been prognosticated--but only such a man could have made such way between
          Thursday and Monday; it is impossible to refuse him admiration." And it is not only the
          emperor Hegel admires, but the whole French people. Three months later he writes that in
          the history of the day he sees convincing proof that culture overcomes barbarism, that
          intellect overcomes unintellectuality. And he even adds: "I have long wished the French
          army success, now all do so; nor can it fail to be successful, considering the enormous
          difference between its leaders and soldiers and those of the enemy."[3]</p>

        <p>If Heine had ever imagined that his enthusiasm for Napoleon required any apology, he
          might have found one in the fact that he was but following in the footsteps of the man <pb
            n="108"/> whom he invariably spoke of with reverence as "the great Hegel, the greatest
          philosopher Germany has produced since Leibnitz," the man of whom he makes the very
          questionable assertion that he quite unquestionably "towers high above Kant," and whom he
          criticises with such lenient and gentle disparagement as the following utterance conveys:
          "Hegel allowed himself to be crowned in Berlin, and alas, to be anointed too."</p>

        <p>Not only Heine's great models and teachers, but contemporaries like Varnhagen von Ense,
          who had actually shed his blood in the war against Napoleon, shared his enthusiasm, and
          were equally free from patriotic enmity to France. Of the Dane Baggesen, who, half German
          by nature, was fain to be more German than the Germans, Varnhagen writes: "His hatred of
          Napoleon and the French is peculiarly offensive; it is an aversion which amounts to
          loathing, and yet it is groundless, for all that is good in us Germans, all that we are
          proudest of in ourselves, he holds in horror and would fain suppress with the help of
          Kant, Jacobi, Voss, and Klopstock." Kant is evidently included in this list on account of
          the very un-German "categorical imperative," the others on account of the extreme
          narrowness of their patriotism.</p>

        <p>The cult of Napoleon is thus, we see, to be traced in the words and works of the men who
          had the greatest influence on Heine's development and on that of young Germany in
          general.</p>

        <p>It inspired Heine's muse several years before it became epidemic in France, and Heine
          rises to an equal height of enthusiasm with Beyle and Hugo. It is not too much to say that
          the poetic expression of this enthusiasm in his youthful poem _The Two Grenadiers_ (which
          he probably wrote at the age of eighteen, though he himself claims to have written it at
          sixteen) surpasses anything of the same nature that exists in French. Not even Béranger's
          _Souvenirs du Peuple_ is so simply grand, although it, better than any other poem, has
          given tangible and touching expression to the French popular Napoleonic legend. In Heine's
          _Grenadiers_ the rhythm of each line answers exactly to its mood <pb n="109"/> and
          matter--the mournful iambics: _Der Andre sprach: das Lied ist aus_; the fiery anapæsts:
          _Dann reitet mein Kaiser wohl über mein Grab_. The grenadier's impossible request to his
          comrade to carry his corpse to France passes almost unnoticed. The wildness of the
          principal strophe: _Was schert mich Weib, was schert mich Kind_, the grenadier's protest
          against the supposition that he is tied by the wife and child he has left at home,
          contrasts forcibly with the sentimentality of the Romantic style. It is only ostensibly
          that this poem glorifies fidelity to Napoleon personally; what it really glorifies is
          loving fidelity to the great leader, unbounded enthusiasm for the great personality.</p>

        <p>The gift of describing by means of introducing characters into lyric poetry was common to
          both Béranger and Heine. But Béranger was a song-writer, Heine a genius. _The Two
          Grenadiers_ begins, as Heine almost always begins, quietly, smoothly. Nothing could be
          more unlike this than Victor Hugo's lyric attack: _Lui! toujours lui!_ Heine does not
          produce his effect by direct representation, but by delineation of the less important, of
          the small things in which the great are reflected, and which provide a standard to gauge
          them by; then at last, following on and issuing from the simple dialogue, comes the burst
          of visionary enthusiasm.</p>

        <p>That the object of this worship was hardly worthy of it, does not make the feeling itself
          less admirable. It is a feeling of exactly the same kind that Heine describes in the
          _Reisebilder_, when he tells how, as a child, he saw Napoleon riding through the ducal
          garden in Düsseldorf. The chapter begins: "But what were my feelings when I saw himself,
          saw him with my own highly-favoured eyes, himself, Hosannah! the Emperor!" Note the
          _Hosannah!_ In the moment of ecstasy, the recollections of childhood bring the Old
          Testament cry of salutation and rejoicing to his lips. And what did the child think on the
          occasion? He remembered that it was forbidden, under a penalty of five thalers, to ride
          through the avenue. And, lo and behold! there was the emperor, with all his officers,
          riding straight through--the shuddering trees bent forward as he passed....</p>

        <p><pb n="110"/> As a political poet, Heine is considered to be revolutionary, and so he
          was. But his political animosity is exclusively aroused by medieval conditions, medieval
          beliefs. He is anti-clerical in good earnest, but not democratic in good earnest. His
          longest political poem, _Deutschland, ein Wintermärchen_, ("Germany, a Winter's Tale"),
          gives abundant evidence of this. It rises to real passion only where the poet's invisible
          companion, the lictor with the terrible axe, breaks up the skeletons of the Three Kings in
          the Cathedral of Cologne, "the miserable skeletons of superstition." But it is in this
          great poem, Heine's most important work, that we have the clearest expression of the
          political feelings and principles which animated him, the element, new to German poetry,
          of warlike challenge and hand-to-hand struggle. Nothing of the kind is to be found in
          Goethe. In the end, indeed, Goethe was persuaded of "the absolute pitiableness of the
          time," but he feared that the overthrow of existing authorities would only make things
          worse. Not even in Schiller can we find any direct reference to the politics of the day.
          His political feeling finds a vent in dramas whose theme is liberty. But in Heine, from
          1830 onwards, we have always this direct expression of the faith that was in him. His soul
          was in politics. And in politics he was honest, even in cases where his honesty was
          misunderstood.</p>

        <p>Turn to that passage in the _Reisebilder_ which is most frequently cited as an expression
          of his boastfulness and affectation, the passage following on the description of his visit
          to the battlefield of Marengo: "'This will be a fine day,' called my travelling
          companion.--Yes, it will be a fine day, silently echoed my heart, uplifted in prayer,
          trembling with sadness and joyfulness. Yes, it will be a fine day, and the sun of liberty
          will gladden the earth. A new generation will spring up and flourish, begotten in free
          embrace, not in a prison bed, under the control of clerical warders; and this free birth
          will generate free thoughts and feelings, of which we born serfs have not even a
          presentiment ..." then at the end these words: "I know not if I deserve that a laurel
          wreath should one day be laid on my coffin. Poetry, dearly as I have loved it; has <pb
            n="111"/> always been to me but a divine plaything, or a weapon consecrated to divine
          purposes.... But lay on my coffin a _sword_, for I was a brave soldier in the Liberation
          War of humanity."</p>

        <p>This political warfare of Heine's is spoken of with the utmost contempt by German
          historians of literature, historians proper, and literary critics; not only by Menzel, but
          by such men as Goedeke, Treitschke, Grisebach (Heine's imitator and denouncer), and Hehn,
          whose perception in other cases is so remarkably acute. Even Scherer is cold and
          depreciatory. When the Italian poet Carducci some years ago celebrated Heine in an ode as
          a hero in the struggle of liberty, even Karl Hillebrand, the best literary critic in
          Germany, who had at one time been Heine's secretary, and had always spoken of him with
          reverence and admiration, made a sort of protest, declaring that Heine himself had never
          taken the thing so seriously. This disfavour and distrust is not surprising. The frivolity
          in Heine's character led in his youth to repellent political vacillation. In 1827, in the
          hope of being appointed to a professorship at Munich, he was ready to disown his previous
          principles to please King Louis, but gained nothing by it. He offered at the same time to
          defend the wretched Duke of Brunswick, the diamond-Duke, in return for a Brunswick order;
          but in this case also he was disappointed. It was not till 1830 that he began to show
          political strength of character.</p>

        <p>We must also remember that in Heine's writings there is an absence of all "pathetic
          gesture." He was too proud to employ it. Germans cannot understand this. But grievous
          wrong is done him. The pathos was in his soul. His whole soul is in the little poem
          _Enfant Perdu_, with which one of the divisions of _Romancero_ concludes, and which he
          wrote when he was no longer young. He really was what he here calls himself, an advanced
          and forgotten outpost, left to be shot down. And when, in his posthumous prose hymn, he
          cries: "I am the sword, I am flame," it is but the truth. The light of his flame, the
          sparks of his sword-blows, still shine bright. Many still warm themselves at his fire.</p>

        <p><pb n="112"/> As already mentioned, Börne, in his _Letters from Paris_, calls Heine an
          inconsistent, vacillating, characterless politician. He does not so much reproach him with
          overrating himself personally as with overrating the influence of the individual human
          being. For it is Börne's opinion that the individual is no longer of much importance. Even
          a Voltaire or a Rousseau would not be a powerful influence nowadays. Individuals are now
          merely the heralds of the people. This Heine forgets. Then, in his desire to please the
          democrats, he declares that the Jesuitic-aristocratic party in Germany malign him because
          he makes a bold stand against absolutism; but almost at the same time, in order to curry
          favour with the aristocrats, says that he has made a stand against Jacobinism, and that he
          is, and always will be, a good monarchist.</p>

        <p>Börne does not always understand a joke. Heine gives a droll account of a Paris millinery
          establishment which he frequented the summer before he writes, where he, as a royalist,
          was one against sixteen, the eight young shop-girls and their eight lovers being all
          violently aggressive republicans. Elsewhere he writes: "God knows I am no Republican. I
          know that when the Republicans are victorious, they will cut off my head ... a piece of
          foolishness for which I am quite ready to forgive them." Börne adds: "Not I. A lunatic
          asylum would be the proper place for Republicans that were such fools as to suppose that
          it was necessary to get rid of Heine in order to attain their aims."</p>

        <p>In spite of their jesting tone, there is something in these and similar utterances of
          Heine's which puzzles the reader. Intermittent outbursts of violent Radicalism, everywhere
          an undertone of the most pronounced revolutionary feeling--and these constantly recurring
          assurances that he is not a Jacobin, not even a Republican.</p>

        <p>An explanation is required, an explanation which no one has yet offered.</p>

        <p>For to say that Heine was characterless, characterless to such a degree, that in the most
          serious matters, and with the eyes of two great nations upon him, he perpetually con<pb
            n="113"/>tradicted himself, is no explanation at all. The vagueness, the contradiction
          must lie in his principles.</p>

        <p>Remember his faithful, boundless devotion to Napoleon, which once more and for the last
          time finds expression in the _Winter's Tale_, in the dirge of the dead emperor, brought in
          his coffin from St. Helena to Paris:</p>

        <p> "Die elysäischen Felder entlang, Durch des Triumphes Bogen, Wohl durch den Nebel, wohl
          über den Schnee Kam langsam der Zug gezogen...."[4]</p>

        <p>And then think of the scene (from the _Reisebilder_) on the battlefield of Marengo. The
          Russian asks Heine: "Are you a good Russian?" And Heine answers: "Yes, I am a good
          Russian." For, he goes on to explain, the incessant change of war-cries and of
          representatives in the great struggle has now led to this--that the most enthusiastic
          friends of the Revolution look for the salvation of the world from the domination of
          Russia, look upon the Emperor Nicholas as the standard-bearer of liberty in Europe. The
          Russian government is permeated with Liberal ideas, its absolutism is simply a
          dictatorship, which gives it the power to put these ideas into practice, &amp;c,
          &amp;c.</p>

        <p>The mistake is colossal in its simplicity. But for our present purpose this is of no
          consequence. What interests us is the fact that Russian absolutism, thus understood by
          Heine, received from him the same measure of approval and sympathy as he had formerly
          bestowed on the rule of Napoleon. Give this due consideration. Heine, the most advanced
          representative of Radicalism among the poets of his time, declares the Emperor Nicholas,
          the most tyrannical autocrat of his time, to be the standard-bearer of liberty! Can this
          be the same man who took a childish pleasure in invariably associating in his mind the
          thought of royal or imperial rank with the thought of the guillotine? Remember his words
          to Barbarossa: "Du wirst hier an ein Brett geschnallt--das senkt sich, &amp;c, &amp;c."
          (They fasten you to a plank--it is lowered, &amp;c), and the concluding <pb n="114"/>
          apostrophe to the venerable old emperor: "Die Republikaner lachen uns aus--sehn sie an
          unserer Spitze--so ein Gespenst mit Scepter und Krön." (The Republicans will laugh us to
          scorn, if they see us led by an old spectre like you, with sceptre and crown). We see that
          he sets some value on the opinion of the Republicans, sees things to a certain extent from
          their standpoint.</p>

        <p>Or again, think of that extraordinarily witty poem "1649-1793-?" which first treats of
          the short and sharp justice meted out to kings in the English and French Revolutions, and
          then prophesies the impending German revolution, but declares that:</p>

        <p> "Der Deutsche wird die Majestät Behandeln stets mit Pietät. In einer sechsspännigen
          Hofkarosse, Schwarz panaschirt und beflort die Rosse-- Hoch auf dem Bock mit der
          Trauerpeitsche Der weinende Kutscher--so wird der deutsche Monarch einst nach dem
          Richtplatz kutschirt, Und unterthänigst guillotinirt."[5]</p>

        <p>If this is not simply playing with words and with feelings, there must be an explanation
          of it, a key to it which Heine himself did not possess. For that there is
          self-contradiction in such words is undeniable.</p>

        <p>The explanation is that Heine was at one and the same time a passionate lover of liberty
          and an out-and-out aristocrat. He had the freedom-loving nature's thirst for liberty,
          pined and languished for it, and loved it with his whole soul; but he had also the great
          nature's admiration for human greatness, and the refined nature's nervous horror of the
          rule of mediocrity.</p>

        <p>In other words, there was not a drop of conservative blood in Heinrich Heine's heart. His
          blood was revolutionary. But neither was there a drop of democratic blood in his heart.
          His blood was aristocratic, his desire was to see genius acknowledged as leader and
          ruler.</p>

        <p><pb n="115"/> When, in his historical retrospects or previsions, he sees a worthless king
          or emperor guillotined, he applauds. But he would give to Cæsar that which is Cæsar's.
          _Apodote ta Kaisaros Kaisari_ is the saying of Jesus which is most deeply engraved on his
          mind. He does not dread a condition of liberty, to which any liberty we have yet known on
          earth is child's play; but he does not believe that liberty would result from the
          realisation of the Philistine ideals of the average mind. All mediocrity, Liberal and
          Republican mediocrity included, he abhors, as inimical to great individuality, to great
          liberty.</p>

        <p>Hence his distrust of the North American Republic, his want of enthusiasm for its
          liberty:</p>

        <p> "Manchmal kommt mir in den Sinn Nach Amerika zu segeln, Nach dem grossen Freiheitsstall,
          Der bewohnt von Gleichheitsflegeln...."[6]</p>

        <p>If Heine adores the _Marseillaise_, it is because the _Marseillaise_ is to him the symbol
          of the great revolt. If he worships Napoleon, it is because Napoleon is the over-thrower
          of kings and of the old order of the world; and if, in Napoleon's case, he overlooks all
          that is inimical to liberty, it is because Napoleon is in his eyes the representative of
          the people, free from any suspicion of democratic mediocrity.</p>

        <p>It is only at a rare time, when he is despondent, when he is not himself, but is making
          use of a borrowed formula, that Heine commits himself to the foolish, plebeian assertion
          that the power of the great personality is a thing of the past--a theory which is in
          reality nothing but the classic expression of middle-class envy. In his heart of hearts
          Heine is so convinced of the contrary that he can go to the mad extreme of imagining
          Nicholas, the obdurate representative of the principle of coercion, to be the chief
          champion of liberty in Europe. But Nicholas was at least a personality, a power. And Heine
          was genius enough to feel that in the last instance personalities and powers are <pb
            n="116"/> the only things that count. Numbers do not, neither do monarchs, not even in
          quantities. Hence Heine's standing joke on the subject of the three dozen German
          monarchs.</p>

        <p>What Heine dreaded was perhaps in the first place a life without beauty. Fourier's
          Phalanstery, the great home of labour, where everything, down to the beer, is equally
          distributed, where there is no room for any superfluity, not even for the superfluity
          which is known by the name of art, seemed to him to be inevitable in the future, but did
          not satisfy him.</p>

        <p>But still more repugnant to him was a life without all greatness, with equality in
          mediocrity as its religion, and hatred to genius, to inquiring minds, to those who openly
          discard Nazarene asceticism, as its only real morality. And equally repugnant to him was
          society as he knew it, dominated by an unintellectual clergy and an unrefined aristocracy,
          and society as he foresaw it, composed of emancipated slave souls, who had only exchanged
          the servility which was their instinct for free indulgence in the envy which lay at the
          root of all their morality.</p>

        <p>He certainly took part with those who rose in revolution against Louis XVI., that worthy
          locksmith who became a king. But he as certainly took part with Cæsar against Brutus, that
          dunce of a usurer, who could do nothing but stick a knife into a great man.</p>

        <p>Heine imagined himself to be a monarchist; he called himself so from sincere conviction,
          because he was a Cæsarian, and had not the word to express it. He imagined himself to be a
          democrat, and called himself so; because he was born a plebeian, hated all unjust
          privileges of birth, and felt himself in eternal opposition to the squirearchy and the
          clergy. But in his inmost soul he was consistent. The apparent contradiction in his
          political sympathies and tendencies arose from the fact that he loved greatness and beauty
          as truly as he loved liberty, and that he was not prepared to sacrifice the highest
          development of humanity on the altar of unreal equality and real mediocrity.</p>

        <head>HEINE</head>

        <p>It seems most probable that Heinrich Heine was born on the 13th of December 1797. His
          father, Samson Heine of Hanover, as a young man took part in a campaign in Flanders and
          Brabant, in the capacity of quartermaster (with the rank of an officer) to the Duke of
          Cumberland, but after his marriage with Peira (Betty) von Geldern, settled down as a
          merchant in Düsseldorf. He was a handsome, placid, grave man, without much ability, even
          as a merchant. He had no taste for art or poetry, but he had a childish love of a fine
          uniform, and aristocratic tastes for gambling, actresses, dogs, and horses. He is said to
          have taken twelve horses with him when he removed to Düsseldorf. The poet's mother was a
          woman of keen intelligence and deep feeling, and was very musical. She had received a good
          education, spoke French and English as fluently as German, was a disciple of Rousseau,
          whose _Émile_ she had studied, and an admirer of Goethe. She early rebelled against
          prejudice and conventionality, and differed from her husband, who reverenced Napoleon, in
          being an ardent patriot. Education was her hobby, and she taught her children with great
          care and patience. Both parents were free-thinkers in the matter of religion--the father
          indifferent, the mother a deist; but they brought up their children in the observance of
          the old Jewish ritual.</p>

        <p>After a short time at a Jewish school for young children, where, it may be, the
          foundation was laid for that knowledge of the Bible which is so conspicuous in his
          writings, Heinrich was placed in an educational establishment carried on in an old
          Franciscan monastery by French ecclesiastics, principally Jesuits, who were at the same
          time educated men of the world. He had had a happy childhood in his <pb n="118"/> home,
          and at school, too, he found friends and protectors, who took his part when his religion
          or his mocking tongue threatened to get him into trouble.</p>

        <p>The earliest noticeable peculiarity in the future poet was a nervousness, which steadily
          grew upon him, and which showed itself in the disagreeable and even painful effect
          produced in him by any kind of noise. Piano-playing and loud talk, at times even his
          sister's sweet, melodious voice, affected him as screaming affects ordinary nerves. And
          his sense of smell was as acute as his hearing. From a child he, like Goethe, loathed
          tobacco smoke. He had no taste for music, and never learned to dance. At fifteen he began
          to write good verse.</p>

        <p>The Rhineland, with its joyousness, but also with its superstition, tradition, and
          legend; the Catholic worship of these parts, with its medieval buildings and ceremonies
          and pilgrimages, over which the Romantic poetry of the day cast a transfiguring halo; the
          impressions produced by Jewish descent, by the poetry of the Bible, and by the craving for
          liberty, and the self-contempt engendered in the Jews by oppression; the enthusiasm for
          the French and for Napoleon, and afterwards, following quickly upon this, the patriotic
          awakening of Germany, which led all the pupils in the highest class of the school, Heine
          among them, to attempt (most of them in vain) to enlist as volunteers in the War of
          Liberation--all these outward conditions and psychological experiences formed and set
          their imprint on the boy's mind. The great humorists, such as Cervantes and Swift, were
          his chosen reading; _Don Quixote_ and _Gulliver's Travels_ his favourite books.</p>

        <p>In his sixteenth year he had a first romantic attachment to a girl of his own age,
          Josepha by name, the daughter of an executioner, who lived with her aunt, the widow of
          another executioner, a woman avoided and feared by all. Heine has told us that the young
          girl was strangely pale, that her movements were rhythmic and dignified, that she had
          finely cut features, large, dark eyes, and blood-red hair. She knew and taught him many
          ballads, was, he himself tells us, the first to awaken his taste for popular poetry, <pb
            n="119"/> and altogether, what with her radiant beauty and the atmosphere of weirdness
          and horror that surrounded her, exercised no small influence on the budding poet. In
          Heine's first poems we observe a tendency towards thoughts of death and the grave, which
          seems to have been one result of the tender attachment of the two children. In No. 6 of
          the _Dream Pictures_, the eternal damnation which is the price that must be paid for the
          possession of the beautiful woman who appears in the dream, seems to symbolise the
          dishonour which clung to the executioner's whole race, and acted like a curse on all who
          dared to connect themselves with it.</p>

        <p>After 1816, Josepha's image is supplanted in Heine's soul by that of another young girl.
          His parents, on whom the brilliant career of the Rothschilds had made a great impression,
          destined their Harry (as he was originally called) to be a merchant. They sent him first
          to a commercial school in Düsseldorf, then for a few months to a banker in Frankfort, and
          finally placed him in an office in Hamburg, where his uncle, the well-known Salomon Heine,
          had risen to be a great man in the commercial world. In 1818, with the help of this rich
          uncle, on whom he remained practically dependent for the rest of his life, Heine began
          business for himself, as a commission agent for English drapery goods. Few were surprised
          when, in the following spring, the firm of "Harry Heine &amp; Co." stopped payment. But in
          his uncle's house Heine had found not only the crusty benefactor who, generous to his
          nephew as he was, never understood him and was always irritated by him, but also, in that
          benefactor's third daughter Amalie, the woman who was to be the fate of his youth, and
          whom he has extolled and execrated under various names--Maria, Zuleima, in correspondence
          Molly. He is never tired of celebrating her charms; she shines in beauty resplendent as
          that of the goddess who emerged from the sea foam; her eyes, lips, and cheeks are those of
          the Madonna in the Cathedral of Cologne; her eyes are violets, her hands lilies, &amp;c,
          &amp;c. But it does not appear that she ever loved him. He hoped in time to win her
          affections, and it is possible that he may now and again have received tokens of her
          favour; <pb n="120"/> from his poems we are led to understand that her marriage to a
          landed proprietor from Königsberg, in the year 1821, stunned him at the time, and was
          afterwards regarded by him as unpardonable treachery.</p>

        <p>Heine had shown how little fitted he was for the career of a merchant, and had moreover
          acquired a thorough distaste for it; fresh help from his uncle now enabled him to prepare
          himself for one of the learned professions. In 1819, soon after the Jewish Reform
          secession, he left Hamburg, and travelled by Düsseldorf to Bonn, there to study law and
          work for the degree which his uncle required that he should take.</p>

        <p>The University of Bonn, which was closed for several years during the French rule, had
          lately been reopened, and had a staff of excellent professors. But it was just at this
          time that, in consequence of the Resolutions of Karlsbad, the prosecution of the students'
          unions (Burschenschaften) and of all national movements among the students began; and
          almost immediately after his arrival at the university, Heine, having taken part in a fête
          on the anniversary of the battle of Leipzig, was summoned before a magistrate and involved
          in a petty and futile political law-suit, which could not fail to arouse in him a keen
          personal detestation of the new reaction. The certificate he received at the matriculation
          examination in 1819 was to the effect that he knew no Greek, had only a slight and
          unpractical knowledge of Latin, and was not qualified to enter for examination in
          mathematics at all; but that he was "not entirely wanting in knowledge of history" and
          that "his German work, though strange in style, showed praiseworthy effort."</p>

        <p>The young student, in the velvet coat and frilled shirt, with lace falling over his
          white, beautifully shaped hands, aimed at careless elegance in dress and deportment. He
          was of middle height; his light-brown hair, which he wore rather long, framed a beardless,
          regular-featured face. The nose was almost Grecian, the eyes were blue, the mouth was
          large and expressive, and the lips were often parted in that cold, scornful smile so
          frequently referred to in his poems.</p>

        <p><pb n="121"/> He attended lectures on the history of the German language, on the
          _Germania_ of Tacitus, on the _Niebelungenlied,_ and other historical and literary
          subjects; dividing his time between these and the law course, lectures on Roman law,
          German law, &amp;c. A professor who had an undoubted influence upon the young poet was A.
          W. Schlegel, the leader of the Romantic school. To him Heine showed his verses. _Almansor_
          was written about this time.</p>

        <p>Towards the end of 1820 Heine left Bonn for Göttingen, with the good intention of
          applying himself diligently to the study of law at the university there. But, as he tells
          us very plainly in the _Harzreise_, the place was distasteful to him, and in the course of
          a few months, moreover, on account of some trifling quarrel with another student, he was
          rusticated. This led to his going to Berlin in 1821. There, in Varnhagen's house, the
          intellectual centre of the day, where Rahel gathered around her the aristocracy of
          culture, talent, and birth, he soon made acquaintance with the élite of the best society
          of the capital. At night, in Lutter and Wegener's restaurant in the Behrenstrasse (still
          in existence), he met the leading lights and genial Bohemians of the day, among them men
          like E. T. W. Hoffmann and Grabbe. And here, after several fruitless attempts, he
          succeeded in finding a publisher, who was willing to take the risk of bringing out his
          first collection of poems and to give him forty copies of the book by way of payment. It
          appeared in December, 1821, made his name known, almost famous, and at once called forth
          both imitations and parodies.</p>

        <p>At the university Heine attended the lectures of the first scholars of the day--Hegel, to
          whom he was ardently devoted; Bopp, the great authority on Sanscrit; Wolf, the classical
          philologist; and Eduard Gans, the great lawyer. He entered with youthful zeal into the
          schemes of a circle of men whose object it was to bring about a reform of Judaism, and who
          were attempting to initiate the Jews into the ideas of European culture. With an equal
          amount of youthful bitterness, he attacked in _Almansor_, in foreign garb, the renegade
          Jews who deserted the common cause; and also, <pb n="122"/> though indirectly,
          Christianity, which he regarded as a hostile power. _Almansor_ was published, along with
          Heine's other youthful work, _William Ratcliff_, in 1823; it was acted, but had no
          success, because of the race hatred felt for its author.[1]</p>

        <p>The life Heine led in Berlin was not compatible with any proper progress in his studies.
          It was but a continuation of the dissipated life to which he had accustomed himself in
          Hamburg. In 1823 he determined to turn over a new leaf, and consequently left Berlin, went
          first to his parents at Lüneburg, thence to Hamburg, and from Hamburg returned to
          Göttingen, where in 1825 he took his degree of Doctor of Law. Immediately after this he
          was baptized. He did not change his religion from conviction of the truth of Christianity;
          on the contrary, his antipathy to it was strong, and he was thoroughly ashamed of the step
          which he took simply with the aim of extricating himself from the humiliating and galling
          position of dependence on his uncle; income, office, or profession being attainable on no
          other condition. His frame of mind at this time is depicted in that overrated fragment,
          _Der Rabbi von Bacharach_, which, in spite of some spirited and artistic passages, really
          proves that Heine was incapable of writing a historical novel. At the end of this work,
          the author, in the disguise of a fictitious character, confesses the shame he felt at
          going over to a religion which to him was the enemy's camp.</p>

        <p>In the correspondence between Varnhagen and Rahel, we find occasional allusions to Heine,
          which give us a good idea of him as he was in those days. Curiously enough, the first time
          Varnhagen mentions "our little Heine," he quotes an exhortation of Rahel's to the young
          man, which is very remarkable, because it shows with what acute perception she had at once
          discovered the very author with whom he had, indeed, something in common, but whom it
          would have been fatal to him, both personally and in a literary sense, to resemble. The
          exhortation is: "You must not become a Brentano. I cannot stand that!" At another <pb
            n="123"/> time she writes jestingly: "Heine must and shall be real, even if he has to be
          thrashed into it.</p>

        <p>'Be real, O man!'"</p>

        <p>And Varnhagen, too, understood him well. How acute is the following remark in a letter to
          Rahel, written six years later: "And now, in addition to all the other wise and clever
          people who entertain you, you have Heine with you, the original, the far-travelled, the
          fresh Heine! Fresh in this case does not necessarily mean fresh from the sea; for salt
          herring, too, and that because they _are_ salted, may be called fresh." The same idea
          recurs in an observation he makes on Heine at the age of thirty: "I hope you will see him
          often, and that he will try to benefit by his intercourse with you. He requires to be
          preserved in a good spiritual atmosphere, for there is something about him that spoils
          easily."[2]</p>

        <p>Rahel and Varnhagen were the first to proclaim Heine's talent. The earliest laudatory
          notice of his poems was written by his fashionable diplomatic patron. Yet it is plain that
          they detected and deplored the weaknesses in his character, which might become dangerous,
          even fatal, to his great poetic gifts.</p>

        <p>[1] G. Karpeles: _Biographie Heinrich Heine's_, 1885.</p>

        <p>[2] _Briefwechsel zwischen Varnhagen und Rahel_, vi. 48, 56, 316, 344. Other interesting
          utterances of Rand's on the subject of Heine are as follows: "I hardly see Heine; he is
          entirely taken up with himself, says he must work hard, is almost surprised that such a
          real thing as his father's death, his mother's grief, should affect him.... He looks
          healthier, hardly complains now at all; but slight grimaces that used to be only
          occasional with him, have grown to be habitual, and are not becoming; for instance a
          twitching of the mouth in speaking, which I used to think rather fascinating, though it
          was no good sign." "I was intending to write about Heine. The conclusion I have come to
          is, that his talent is very great, but that unless it matures, it will lose all substance,
          will degenerate into hollow mannerism." Varnhagen answers: "The one hope for Heine is that
          he should gain the foothold of truth; once firmly established on that, he may let his
          talent sally forth to seek prey and disport itself where it will" (vi. 347, 356, 365).</p>

        <head>HEINE</head>

        <p>The most popular of Heine's books in our day, that with which his name is most
          inseparably connected, the _Buch der Lieder_ of 1827, consists of groups of poems
          belonging to different years and periods.</p>

        <p>The first group, _Junge Leiden_ (1817-1821), is, as such, the weakest. It is divided into
          four parts: Dream Pictures, Songs, Romances, Sonnets. The subjects treated are: early
          recollections of Düsseldorf and of a happy childhood there, his love to his mother,
          Napoleon worship, much Catholic Rhineland romance, churchyard dances of death with rattle
          of bones, and all sorts of visions. We have the jesting tone--jocose complaints of the
          embarrassments resulting from the all too speedy disappearance of the ducats; and the
          bitter tone, produced by the poet's resentment of the humiliations to which he, as an
          unsuccessful and defaulting young merchant, was subjected by the wealthy citizens of
          Hamburg. We have outbursts of affection for college friends, and of admiration for A. W.
          Schlegel, a man as distinguished in the literary world as at the university; and also
          patriotic outbursts in the "Burschen" style, which Heine quickly tired of. We have
          passionate expression of the self-consciousness of genius, and we have love-griefs and
          plaints of various sorts--first love's aspirations (blended in E. T. W. Hoffmann's manner
          with churchyard horrors), and then exceedingly sentimental laments over unreturned love,
          and outbursts of wild, despairing accusation of the false one, who has given him his
          deathblow, and who drinks his blood and eats his heart at her wedding feast. In one single
          poem, _Die Fensterschau_, the mood suddenly changes into a sort of coarse jollity.</p>

        <p>Of these youthful poems, which for the most part are <pb n="125"/> old-fashioned in form,
          the best are the famous epigrammatic quatrain beginning: "Anfangs wollt' ich fast
          verzagen" (I at first was near despairing), the earliest example of the condensation of
          Heine's style; a few of the sonnets, which are much more passionate than the great
          majority of German sonnets; and lastly, among the romances, _Belsazer_, probably inspired
          by Byron's _Hebrew Melodies_, and the inimitable ballad of the _Two Grenadiers_, already
          referred to.</p>

        <p>The second group, which owes its odd title, _Lyric Intermezzo_, to the fact that it first
          appeared as a lyric interlude between the two bad tragedies, _Almansor_ and _Ratcliff_,
          published in 1823, treats of the same subjects as the first, but in more uncommon forms
          and with freer artistic manipulation. Two critics, Ernst Elster and Wilhelm Bölsche (the
          former in the introduction to his edition of the original text of the _Buch der Lieder_,
          the latter in an independent work on Heine), have pointed out with much critical acumen
          that in this division we seldom have a direct expression of the poet's love troubles, but
          rather a sort of extract of them, which he gives us from memory. His imagination runs riot
          among the old sufferings, now and again actually playing with them; hence we have an
          occasional unlucky expression; the reader at times doubts the reality of the feeling, and
          becomes suspicious of the constant assurances of a killing grief, in despite of which life
          goes on and art is not neglected.</p>

        <p>But it was only natural that Heine should fall back upon this one passion, even though it
          had received no new nourishment in the interval. He had felt none since which could
          compare with it in strength or in influence upon his inner life. It was, and it remained,
          the most important incident in his life. It seems as if any happiness it brought him had
          been most transient; hence the first time he sang of his love he dwelt exclusively on its
          woes, on the absence of all return, on his forsakenness, on the treachery and cold cruelty
          of the beloved. Now that he was so far disenthralled, he related the whole real or
          imaginary history of the passion, from the day when it first awoke to life to the hour
          when he was as dead for her; and imparted greater piquancy <pb n="126"/> and fulness to
          its life story by giving each of its separate moments some background drawn from nature in
          one or other of her many moods. In the _Dream Pictures_ night reigned supreme. Now we have
          the budding of the leaf, the singing of the birds, and the starlight of May.</p>

        <p>That the love supposed to be at first felt by the beloved one for the poet is only a
          fiction, and does not really agree with the facts of the case, Heine involuntarily
          discloses when he paints tender scenes between them. For in these the lover never feels
          himself to be the possessor; even when he holds the object of his desire in his arms his
          only feeling is longing:</p>

        <p> "Lehn deine Wang' an meine Wang', Dann fliessen die Thränen zusammen! Und an mein Herz
          drück fest dein Herz, Dann schlagen zusammen die Flammen!</p>

        <p> Und wenn in die grosse Flamme fliesst Der Strom von unseren Thränen, Und wenn dich mein
          Arm gewaltig umschliesst-- _Sterb' ich vor Liebessehnen._"[1]</p>

        <p>[1]</p>

        <p> Thy cheek incline, dear love to mine, Then our tears in one stream will meet, love! Let
          thy heart be pressed till on mine it rest, Then the flames together will beat, love!</p>

        <p> And when the stream of our tears shall light On that flame so fiercely burning, And
          within my arms I clasp thee tight-- I shall die with love's wild yearning. (Translated by
          SIR THEODORE MARTIN.)</p>

        <p>This favoured lover, who, when the flames meet, dies of longing, betrays himself to be in
          reality a thoroughly unsatisfied lover.</p>

        <p>Hence the best of the purely erotic poems are those which express love's longing and
          those which depict its sad decay. Conspicuous amongst the poems of tender longing is the
          charming Oriental song, _Auf Flügeln des Gesanges, Herzliebchen, trag' ich dich fort_,
          which fascinates by its exotic Indian landscape and by its delicate fervency of feeling.
          Heine longed for India as Goethe longed for Italy; his spiritual home was on the banks of
          the Ganges, as <pb n="127"/> Goethe's was on the banks of the Tiber. It is probable that
          Bopp's lectures first turned his thoughts in the direction of that Oriental dream-land;
          but in picturing it he employs the purely imaginative, Romantic style, which he inherited,
          remodelled for himself, and used in painting the far-off and alluring.</p>

        <p>How simply beautiful is such a verse as:</p>

        <p> "Dort wollen wir niedersinken Unter dem Palmenbaum, Und Lieb' und Ruhe trinken Und
          träumen seligen Traum."[2]</p>

        <p>[2]</p>

        <p> We'll lie there, in slumber sinking, 'Neath the palm tree by the stream, Raptures and
          rest deep drinking, Dreaming the happiest dream. (C. G. LELAND.)</p>

        <p>But a verse like:</p>

        <p> "Dort liegt ein rothblühender Garten Im stillen Mondenschein, Die Lotosblumen erwarten
          Ihr trautes Schwesterlein."[3]</p>

        <p>[3]</p>

        <p> There a red-blooming garden is lying In the moonlight silent and clear; The lotus
          flowers are sighing For their sister so gentle and dear. (E. A. BOWRING.)</p>

        <p>beautiful as it is, caressing as it sounds, has something of the unnaturalness which
          often strikes the reader in Heine's painting of nature. The colouring is vivid, but not
          real; local colours obtrude themselves to the detriment of the general tone.
          "Rothblühender," (red-blooming) is hardly the word that it would naturally occur to one to
          use in describing a garden seen by moonlight. In the lines: "Gegenüber am Fenster sassen
          _Rosengesichter_ dämmernd und _mond_beglänzt." (At the opposite window glimmered
          rose-faces, bright in the moonlight glow), from the later poem _Abenddämmerung_
          ("Twilight"), we have the same sort of effect, produced at the same expense of
          naturalness. The declaration that the lotus flowers are expecting their dear sister sounds
          like an old-fashioned compliment in the midst of <pb n="128"/> this gorgeous Ganges
          imagery. We have much the same expression in the stanza:</p>

        <p> "Es flüstern und sprechen die Blumen Und schau'n mitleidig mich an: Sei unsrer Schwester
          nicht böse, Du trauriger, blasser Mann!"[4]</p>

        <p>[4]</p>

        <p> The flowers are whispering and talking; With pity my features they scan: O, pray do not
          chide our sister, Thou sorrowful, pale-faced man! (C. G. LELAND.)</p>

        <p>This is a madrigal style which Heine leaves behind in his later work.</p>

        <p>Another of the verses in this wonderfully emotional song of the Ganges has
          characteristics which point to Heine's derivation from the Romantic school, with its
          arbitrary interpretation of nature:--</p>

        <p> "Die Veilchen kichern und kosen Und schau'n nach den Sternen empor."[5]</p>

        <p>[5]</p>

        <p> The violets titter, caressing, Peeping up as the planets appear. (C. G. LELAND.)</p>

        <p>It is quite audacious enough to represent violets as caressing each other; we are
          reminded of Hans Andersen's enchanted gardens; to make them titter is certainly too much
          of a good thing. Émile Zola affects this same style in his description of the Paradou
          garden.</p>

        <p>The next song, which is conceived in the same spirit, the song of the lotus flower that
          fears the splendour of the sun, is a charming poem, despite its flower-innocence,
          marvellously, meltingly sensuous. Sensual-spiritual desire is here intensified till it
          reaches the verge of hysteria; for the poet, not content with making the lotus flower
          blossom and glow and shine and exhale fragrance and tremble, when her lover, the moon,
          awakes her with his rays, actually makes her weep.[6]</p>

          Jahrgang 57, Nr. 18, 19, 20.</p>

        <p>Next in real feeling to the poems of desire come those <pb n="129"/> that express the
          relinquishment, the cessation of the passion. The finest example is poem No. 59 in the
          _Intermezzo_, which in its first verse describes the falling of a star, the star of love,
          from heaven; in its second, the falling of the apple-blossoms from the tree; in its third,
          the sinking of a swan to its watery grave; then sums all up in the concluding verse:</p>

        <p> "Es ist so still und dunkel! Verweht ist Blatt und Blüth', Der Stern ist knisternd
          zerstoben, Verklungen das Schwanenlied."[7]</p>

        <p>[7]</p>

        <p> The silence and the night fall, The blossoms all have fled, In sparks the star has
          vanished, The swan and his song are dead. (H. F.)</p>

        <p>It is very characteristic of Heine that, as the poem stands, it does not produce the
          impression that he has really witnessed any one of the three natural scenes depicted; they
          are simply symbols, arbitrarily selected and combined.</p>

        <p>Amongst this passionate verse he has interspersed poems of a totally different
          description, treating of far more trivial amours. Some of the most exceptionable of these
          he did not include in the _Buch der Lieder_, not even, for example, the very
          harmless:--</p>

        <p> "Du sollst mich liebend umschliessen, Geliebtes, schönes Weib! Umschling mich mit Armen
          und Füssen Und mit dem geschmeidigen Leib!"[8]</p>

        <p>[8]</p>

        <p> Come, twine in wild rapture round me, Fair woman, beloved and warm, Till thy feet and
          hands have bound me, And I'm wreathed with thy supple form! (LELAND.)</p>

        <p>But we have, among others, _Die Welt ist dumm, die Welt ist blind_ ("The world is stupid,
          the world is blind"), with its description of burning kisses. There are also other
          epigrammatic verses of a serious, passionate character, such as <pb n="130"/> the
          well-known _Ich hab' dich geliebet und liebe dich noch_ ("I have loved thee long, and I
          love thee now"); and, finally, in the very famous _Ein Jüngling liebt ein Mädchen, die hat
          einen Andern erwählt_ ("A young man loves a maiden, who another to him prefers"), with
          intentional triviality of diction, and with an impersonality which is unusual with him,
          Heine generalises the human fate which has made of him an erotic poet.</p>

        <p>To the collection of poems which form the second part of the _Lyric Intermezzo_, the
          title _Heimkehr_ ("The Home-Coming") is given. They were written in 1823-1824 in Hamburg
          and Cuxhaven, and the "home-coming" is the poet's return to Hamburg, the scene of his love
          romance, where the sight of all the familiar surroundings causes his heart's wounds to
          bleed afresh. With this main theme is associated another, new in German poetry--the sea,
          which Heine now saw for the first time.</p>

        <p>Mingled with the lamentations over his lost love, which the sight of the environments of
          the old tragedy calls forth, are records of new impressions. There is first a wild
          outbreak of the old passion; he broods once more over all its agonies; he is miserable in
          the streets, where he feels as if the houses were falling on him, and still more miserable
          in the rooms where she plighted her faith to him. What is new in these songs of unhappy
          love is the hatred, always alike passionate and wild, that flames up over the grave of
          buried happiness.</p>

        <p>But on his travels the poet has met the family of his beloved, and her younger sister
          resembles her, especially when she laughs; she has the same eyes, the eyes that have made
          him so unhappy. In a letter dated August 23rd, 1823, he tells his best friend that "a new
          folly has been engrafted on the old." Ernst Elster's careful study of letters and poems
          has enabled him to show that about this time Heine's first and very unfortunate passionate
          attachment to Amalie Heine was superseded by a passion for Therese Heine, who was her
          sister's junior by eight years. Eveline and Ottilie are the poetic names bestowed on
          Therese. The new passion was a violent one, but in all <pb n="131"/> probability met with
          as little return as the first. Hence the well-known lines:</p>

        <p> "Wer zum ersten Male liebt, Sei's auch glücklos, ist ein Gott; Aber wer zum zweiten Male
          Glücklos liebt, der ist ein Narr.</p>

        <p> Ich, ein solcher Narr, ich liebe Wieder ohne Gegenliebe; Sonne, Mond und Sterne lachen,
          Und ich lache mit--und sterbe."[9]</p>

        <p>[9]</p>

        <p> He who for the first time loves, Though unloved, is still a god; But the man who loves a
          second And in vain, must be a fool.</p>

        <p> Such a fool am I, now loving Once again, without return; Sun and moon and stars are
          smiling, And I smile with them--and perish. (LELAND.)</p>

        <p>In the year 1828 Therese Heine was engaged and married to a Dr. Adolf Halle. Among
          Heine's posthumous poems are bitterly satirical verses on the bridegroom and the wedding.
          He had the unchivalrous poet's habit of revenging himself by satire when he met with a
          rebuff. But the poems in _Heimkehr_ which refer to Therese are not inspired with the
          bitterness and hatred which Heine frequently displays in writing of her elder sister. He
          praises Therese's beauty, her lovely eyes, her purity; she is like a flower; he prays to
          her as others pray to Paul and Peter and the Madonna; and he struggles against his
          feelings, dreads this new passion. Both pride and shyness forbid him to declare it; it
          would be better for her if she did not love him; at times he has himself tried to prevent
          the awakening of love in her soul; but, having been only too successful in the attempt,
          the desire for her love once more asserts itself. He is too proud to speak of his passion
          and of his suffering, mockery and jests are on his lips, while inwardly he is bleeding to
          death; but she does not understand him, does not see <pb n="132"/> that his heart is
          trembling, is breaking. Hence these lines:</p>

        <p> "O, dieser Mund ist viel zu stolz Und kann nur küssen und scherzen; Er spräche
          vielleicht ein höhnisches Wort, Während ich sterbe vor Schmerzen."[10]</p>

        <p>[10]</p>

        <p> Alas, this mouth is far too proud, 'Twas made but for kissing and sighing; Perchance it
          may speak a scornful word, While I with sorrow am dying. (BOWRING.)</p>

        <p>But this time the threat of dying is not intended to be taken literally. For in another
          poem we find the sincere assurance:--</p>

        <p> "Glaub' nicht, dass ich mich erschiesse, Wie schlimm auch die Sachen steh'n! Das Alles,
          meine Süsse, Ist mir schon einmal gescheh'n."[11]</p>

        <p>[11]</p>

        <p> Fear not that I shall languish, Or shoot myself: oh, no! I've gone through all this
          anguish Already, long ago. (LELAND.)</p>

        <p>Undoubtedly, however, he felt deeply and suffered greatly this time also. Strange as it
          sounds, cousin-love, which is, as a rule, merely the initiation into the life of passion,
          its first preliminary stage,[12] (Note 20) was the only serious, and not perfectly
          transient passion known to young Heine. And no feeling experienced later, in his mature
          manhood, approached in intensity to this youthful twin-passion for two sisters, the second
          of whom reminded him of the first.</p>

        <p>[12]</p>

        <p> Aux prés de l'enfance on cueille Les petites amourettes Qu'on jette au vent feuille à
          feuille, Ainsi que des pâquerettes; On cueille dans ces prairies Les voisines, les
          cousines, Les amourettes fleuries Et qui n'ont pas de racines. (RICHEPIN.)</p>

        <p>Among the emotional poems which refer to this episode in his psychic history, Heine
          introduced (exactly as he did <pb n="133"/> in the _Intermezzo_) verses relating to less
          serious love affairs, to college adventures, and even to quite low, venal, erotic
          pleasures. He omitted from the _Buch der Lieder_ some of the most objectionable of these,
          which originally formed part of the _Heimkehr_, amongst others the amusing, though
          impudent:</p>

        <p> "Blamier mich nicht, mein schönes Kind, Und grüss mich nicht unter den Linden; Wenn wir
          nachher zu Hause sind, Wird sich schon Alles finden."[13]</p>

        <p>[13]</p>

        <p> Don't compromise me, my pretty one, Don't bow to me in "Rotten Row"; At home together
          afterwards I'll make up for it, that you know.</p>

        <p>--and even such a merry wanton rhyme as:--</p>

        <p> "Himmlisch war's, wenn ich bezwang Meine sündige Begier; Aber wenn's mir nicht gelang,
          Hatt' ich doch ein gross Plaisir."[14]</p>

        <p>[14]</p>

        <p> 'Twas heavenly joy to overcome Each sinful wish and thought; But when I couldn't, truth
          to tell, That, too, much pleasure brought.</p>

        <p>What we are most struck by in the poems of this division is the author's double gift of
          song and painting. Along with the capacity for producing those outbursts of mixed passion,
          which sound like the unaffected heart-cry of modern humanity, he here reveals a special
          talent for painting, for producing figures by means of light and shade and colour, without
          outline.</p>

        <p>There is the scene in the lonely parsonage, with the disunited, despairing family (_Der
          bleiche, herbstliche Halbmond_). The son is determined to be a highway robber, the
          daughter has made up her mind to sell herself to the Count. With all its vividness,
          however, this scene is not one of the best. There is too much old-fashioned Romanticism in
          the idea of the dead father in his black robes standing outside, knocking at the window.
          The next poem, _Das ist ein schlechtes Wetter_, is a most masterly production. We see the
          little old woman hobbling across the street with <pb n="134"/> her lantern late on the
          dark and stormy evening, to make purchases for her tall, beautiful daughter, who is lying
          in the arm-chair at home, blinking sleepily at the light, her golden locks falling over
          her sweet face--it is like an old Dutch painting.</p>

        <p>Still finer is the group of eight poems which was the result of his stay at Cuxhaven.
          _Wir sassen am Fischerhause_ is a little marvel of artistic ability--that talk with the
          girls, sitting outside the fisherman's hut, in which far-off India and Ultima Thule are
          described in a few words: "By the Ganges all is brightness and fragrance, giant trees
          blossom, and beautiful, tranquil men and women kneel to the lotus flowers. In Lapland the
          people are dirty and small; their heads are flat and their mouths are wide; they cower
          round the fire, roast fish, and screech and scream."</p>

        <p>Then there are merry poems, treating of light characters like the girl whom he searches
          for through the whole town and finds in a fashionable hotel, and the girl in whose heart
          the blue hussars are quartered.</p>

        <p>And lastly, there are single epigrammatic verses, which every one now knows by heart, but
          which, at the time they appeared, gave great offence and made enemies for their author.
          Especially noteworthy is the famous:</p>

        <p> "Selten habt ihr mich verstanden, Selten auch verstand ich euch, Nur wenn wir im Koth
          uns fanden, So verstanden wir uns gleich."[15]</p>

        <p>[15]</p>

        <p> Little by thee comprehended, Little knew I thee, good brother; When we in the mud
          descended Soon we understood each other. (LELAND.)</p>

        <p>It is incomprehensible that this verse should ever have been regarded as a confession of
          unclean instincts. It only applies to those who find their way straight to any
          exceptionable or indecent passage in a book, as the sow finds her way to the mire, and
          stops there. That it never occurred to Heine that he was making any admission of having
          desired to appeal to his reader's sensual instincts or cynic <pb n="135"/> tendencies is
          best proved by the poem which immediately follows on the lines in question, the one
          beginning:</p>

        <p> "Doch die Kastraten klagten, Als ich meine Stimm' erhob; Sie klagten und sie sagten: Ich
          sänge viel zu grob."[16]</p>

        <p>[16]</p>

        <p> How the eunuchs were complaining At the roughness of my song! Complaining and explaining
          That my voice was much too strong. (LELAND.)</p>

        <p>He could not have declared more unmistakably that, where he is straightforward,
          plain-spoken, or cynical, it is only the result of his modern tendency to realistic
          truthfulness, of his antipathy to romantic embellishment, and of his instinctive
          inclination to face the bitter truth of life.</p>

        <p>And there is quite as little justification for the general complaint of what Julian
          Schmidt has called the low-mindedness of Heine's sudden leaps from the sublime to the
          sordid. We have a typical instance of these sudden changes of style and mood in the poem
          _Frieden_ ("Peace"), one of the group of North Sea poems, in which Heine, during a calm at
          sea, beholds the giant form of Jesus, the Prince of Peace, striding over sea and land. He
          is clothed in white; his head touches the clouds; the heart in his breast is the sun, the
          red, flaming sun, and this sun-heart sheds its illuminating, warming rays over land and
          sea. Then there is a sudden revulsion of mood. Heine calls to mind a miserable, canting
          fellow in Berlin, weak in mind and body, strong in faith--what would not _he_ give to be
          able to hit upon such pious imagery, by means of which he might ingratiate himself with
          those in power and perhaps attain to the position of court-councillor in the pious town on
          the Spree--what dreams he would have of a hundred thalers rise in salary!</p>

        <p>Heine most undoubtedly spoiled the effect of his beautiful vision. He broke up his poem,
          shattered its melody with grotesque discords; but yet it is easy to understand that in the
          case of a poet with his experience of modern life, the second vision was a perfectly
          natural sequel to the first; <pb n="136"/> and in any case it is unjustifiable to speak of
          this connection of ideas, this "idea-leap," as a symptom of low-mindedness. In this
          connection Wilhelm Bölsche makes the true and pertinent observation that no one has
          accused Goethe of low-mindedness because he allows the gibes of Mephistopheles to follow
          directly upon Faust's confession of faith to Gretchen (_Heinrich Heine_, p. 106). And yet
          the only difference is that in _Faust_ the pathos and the ribaldry are put into the mouths
          of two people, whereas in the lyric poem the poet makes himself directly responsible for
          both.</p>

        <p>Almost at the end of this collection (_Heimkehr_), we come upon a couple of poems which
          are distinguished by depth of feeling and perfection of form. The particular arrangement
          of their rhymes would distinguish them from the majority of the small poems, if nothing
          else did, as it is one we seldom meet with in Heine. The first, _Dämmernd liegt der
          Sommerabend_ ("Summer eve with day is striving"), which describes the beautiful elf-maiden
          bathing in the river by moonlight, has the diaphanous haze of a Corot landscape. The
          rhythmic treatment of the second gives it a unique place in the collection. It is the
          pathetic, fantastic:</p>

        <p> "Der Tod, das ist die kühle Nacht, Das Leben ist der schwüle Tag. Es dunkelt schon, mich
          schläfert, Der Tag hat mich müd gemacht.</p>

        <p> Über mein Bett erhebt sich ein Baum, Drin singt die junge Nachtigall; Sie singt von
          lauter Liebe, Ich hör' es sogar im Traum."[17]</p>

        <p>[17]</p>

        <p> Death is a cool and pleasant night, Life is a sultry day. 'Tis growing dark-I'm weary,
          For day has tired me with his light.</p>

        <p> Over my bed a fair tree gleams, And in it sits a nightingale: She sings of naught save
          love, I hear it even in dreams. (LELAND.)</p>

        <p><pb n="137"/> The next division of the _Buch der Lieder, Aus der Harzreise_ (1824),
          contains the delightful mountain-rhymes conceived in the course of a walking tour which
          Heine took by way of refreshment after his law studies in Göttingen. Here we have charming
          pictures of mountain scenery and peasant life, and a tone of witty, bold self-laudation,
          kept up with irresistible audacity. The beautiful and witty poem about the knight of the
          Holy Spirit was doubtless suggested by the catechising scene in _Faust_, but has an
          originality of its own which has made it popular all the world over.</p>

        <p>The _Buch der Lieder_ closes with the North Sea poems (_Die Nordsee_, 1825-1826),
          inspired by two visits to Norderney, and written in forcible, irregular rhythm. In them we
          observe first and foremost a particular understanding of nature which is a new gain for
          German poetry.</p>

        <p>As far as nature was concerned, Goethe seemed to have exhausted everything. His love for
          every living thing, his feeling of kinship with animals and plants, his persuasion that
          the human being is one with all other beings, his intuition of the unity that underlies
          perpetual change of form--this gift of resolving all nature into feeling was his earliest
          characteristic. It was soon superseded, or rather supplemented, by his capacity for
          observing and reproducing natural scenes without any ascription of his own feelings to
          them. He studies nature, becomes an observer and investigator, and finally, thanks to the
          steadily increasing profundity of his observation, in combination with his genial
          intuition, an epoch-making discoverer in two great domains of natural science. We see him
          pass through all the phases of a great mind in its relation to nature--the emotional, the
          religious-pantheistic, the poetic-scientific--and see him in the end lay such exclusive
          stress upon material impressions that he thrusts all that is psychical from him as merely
          disturbing. His views become more and more positive and realistic. In his essay on granite
          he writes: "I do not fear the reproach of its being a spirit of contradiction that has led
          me from the observation and delineation of the human heart, that youngest, most multiform,
          most mobile, most changeable part of creation, that which <pb n="138"/> it is easiest to
          unsettle and to shake, to the observation of nature's oldest, firmest, deepest, most
          immovable son"[18] --namely, granite.</p>

        <p>[18] Goethe: _Werke_, xxxiii. 164.</p>

        <p>In what domain was it still possible for a German poet to display fresh, original
          understanding of nature? From the human heart to granite Goethe had embraced them all.</p>

        <p>There was one left. Goethe had never sung the sea. He saw it for the first time when he
          was nearly forty, in Venice, from the Lido. "I heard a loud noise," he writes; "it was the
          sea, and I soon saw it, rolling high waves up the beach, as it drew back. It was midday
          and ebb-tide. At last, then, I have seen the sea also with my own eyes." A little further
          on we come upon the short sentence: "Yes, the sea is a wonderful sight." In the Fifth Act
          of the Second Part of _Faust_, where the sea and navigation are touched on, it is less the
          sea itself that is in question than the rescuing of land from it and the making of canals.
          This was all that Goethe had written about the sea.</p>

        <p>In Heine's North Sea poems we hear, for the first time in German poetry, the roar of the
          ocean, with all its freshness and in all its might. Here for the first time we have shells
          in the sand beneath our feet, and sea-gulls in the air above us. The sea is painted in
          storm and calm, from the shore and from the ship, by day and by night, with the peace that
          at times lies over it, and with the madness of the hurricane; we have the sweet day-dreams
          to which it gives rise, and also the sea-sickness; there arise from its depths and there
          hover over its expanse a whole company of mythic figures, old and new, old that have been
          metamorphosed into new, a world of gods and goddesses, Tritons and Oceanides, at times
          pathetic, more frequently burlesque. And yet there is comparatively little description; it
          is the poet's own memories, griefs, and hopes that fill these poems. And it is his intense
          longing to be able to breathe freely that breaks forth in the famous cry with which the
          ten thousand Greeks, after their long and terrible march, hailed the <pb n="139"/> element
          that spoke to them of home: "Thalatta! Thalatta!--I salute thee, O eternal sea!"</p>

        <p>Amongst these poems are some of Heine's most beautiful and unforgettable. First there is
          the humorously frivolous idyll _Die Nacht am Strande_ ("Night by the Seashore"); the
          poet's visit to the pretty fisherman's daughter, with the masterly description of her
          appearance, as she sits bending over the fire:</p>

        <p> "Dass die flackernd rothen Lichter Zauberlieblich wiederstrahlen Auf das glühende
          Antlitz, Auf die zarte, weisse Schulter, Die rührend hervorlauscht Aus dem groben, grauen
          Hemde, Und auf die kleine, sorgsame Hand, Die das Unterröckchen fester bindet Um die feine
          Hüfte."[19]</p>

        <p>[19]</p>

        <p> Till the flashing, ruddy flame-rays Shine again in magic lustre On her glowing
          countenance, On the soft and snow-white shoulder Which so touchingly peers out From its
          coarse grey linen covering, And on the busy little hand Which is fastening the garment
          That conceals her slender limbs. (Adapted from LELAND.)</p>

        <p>Then we come on a poem which is unique in its lyric vigour, _Erklärung_ ("Declaration"),
          to that Agnes whose name the poet would fain write on the dark vault of heaven with the
          highest fir of Norway, dipped in the crater of Etna. And there is also the little,
          reflective poem _Fragen_ ("Questions"), admirable in its pregnant brevity, which gives us
          an idea of the mood in which Heine conceived the foolhardy idea of writing a "Faust,"
          after Goethe, a plan which he actually did not hesitate to mention to Goethe himself, when
          he visited him in Weimar. In some of these North Sea poems, and that even when he is
          belittling and sneering at himself, there is a repellent tone of self-satisfaction.
          Amongst those which are quite free from it, must be <pb n="140"/> mentioned that masterly
          piece of pure humour, _Im Hafen_ ("In Harbour"), the immortal fantasy of the Town Cellar
          of Bremen, in which Heine, whose sobriety was almost equivalent to total abstinence, gives
          us a most irresistible picture of a clever man's merry carouse.</p>

        <head>HEINE</head>

        <p>It is impossible for a northerner of mature years and fairly sound artistic training to
          study Heinrich Heine's poems without feeling his taste offended by figures and expressions
          which in Heine's case early became lifeless mannerisms. The Romance nations do not feel
          this. One actually hears competent critics of Romance nationality compare Heine's lyrics
          with Goethe's, and give the preference to Heine's as more plastic and more spiritual. To
          Romance readers Goethe is, as a rule, wanting in transparency; the French say of Heine:
          _On y voit mieux_. They do not feel that in Goethe's case words always represent things;
          whereas in Heine's case, expressions are often set pieces, which are inserted to produce a
          certain poetical effect, but which have no vision, no actuality behind them. Few poets
          have made such abuse of lily-hands, rose-cheeks, and violet-eyes, these monstrous
          colour-blotches, in describing female beauty, or of the various attributes of
          spring--flowers that exhale fragrance, nightingales that sing both day and night--in
          proclaiming the praises of the lovely month of May. The nightingale in particular becomes
          under his treatment a purely heraldic bird in the coat-of-arms of love.</p>

        <p>In Goethe's case all the words are images, and this is the reason why he requires to
          employ so little imagery. In Heine's the words are constantly allegories, devoid of
          perspicuity and of that inward connection which is the logic of poetry. Take as an
          instance: "Aus meinen Thränen spriessen--vie' blühende Blumen hervor,"[1] where by flowers
          poems are meant; or: "Sprüh'n einmal vert <pb n="142"/> dächt'ge Funken--aus den Rosen,
          sorge nie--diese Welt glaubt nicht an Flammen--und sie nimmt's für Poesie,"[2] where we
          are presented with a skein of images more entangled than those of the notorious old
          Scandinavian transcriptions of the decadent period in Skaldic poetry--sparks struck out of
          roses; sparks, which the everyday world will not accept as fire; rose sparks, which are
          called poetry!</p>

        <p>[1]</p>

        <p> Up from my tears are growing Fair flowers in many vales. (LELAND)</p>

        <p>[2]</p>

        <p>If suspicious sparks should issue From the roses--fearless be! This dull world in flames
          believes not, But believes them poetry. (BOWRING)</p>

        <p>What one objects to most in these poems with their allegorical rhetoric is the
          combination of sentimentality and materialism. Sighs and tears are talked of as if sighs
          were very loud breaths and tears very tangible substances. We have, for instance: "Und
          meine Seufzer werden--ein Nachtigallenchor" (And from my sighs go flying, A choir of
          nightingales), still further materialised by the addition of: "Und vor deinem Fenster soll
          singen--das Lied der Nachtigall" (And the nightingales at thy window, Shall sing all the
          summer hours). A still more striking instance is to be found in the typical poem of the
          lonely tear:--</p>

        <p> "Was will die einsame Thräne? Sie trübt mir ja den Blick, Sie blieb aus alten Zeiten In
          meinem Auge zurück."[3]</p>

        <p>[3]</p>

        <p> What means this lonely tear-drop Which dims mine eye to-day? It is the last now left me
          Where once so many lay.</p>

        <p>We are initiated into this particular tear's family history and present lonely situation;
          it had many bright sisters, who now are no more, so that it is left solitary in its
          eyecorner. It is addressed much as one would address any good old comrade, told to go its
          way, now that all the others have gone:--</p>

        <p> "Du alte, einsame Thräne, Zerfliesse jetzunder auch!"[4]</p>

        <p>[4]</p>

        <p> Thou tear-drop old and lonely, Do thou, too, pass away!</p>

        <p><pb n="143"/> The sentimentality is so crude that no parody could be more comic than this
          mournful apostrophe, which the arch-scoffer wrote in all good faith.</p>

        <p>Every defect in the artist as a man, comes out in his art. It is always a want of
          simplicity, of genuine feeling, that produces the sentimental or ostentatious or clap-trap
          expression. Heine's shortcomings in this way are strongly felt when we compare certain
          outbursts of his with Goethe's expression of similar feelings.</p>

        <p>Take, for example, the poem in which Heine describes himself as the ill-fated Atlas;
          condemned to bear the whole world of suffering:</p>

        <p> "Du stolzes Herz, du hast es ja gewollt, Du wolltest glücklich sein, unendlich
          glücklich, Oder unendlich elend, stolzes Herz! Und jetzo bist du elend."[5]</p>

        <p>[5]</p>

        <p> Proud heart, 'twas thine own choice, Thou chosest to be happy, infinitely happy, Or
          infinitely miserable, proud heart! And now thou art miserable.</p>

        <p>These are lines one does not forget. But the exclamation of the first line, which
          expresses a perilous extreme of self-reliance, becomes self-complacency when Heine's
          stanza is placed alongside of Goethe's simple and grand</p>

        <p> "Alles geben die Götter, die Unendlichen, Ihren Lieblingen ganz: Alle Freuden, die
          unendlichen, Alle Schmerzen, die unendlichen, Ganz."[6]</p>

        <p>[6] What the eternal Gods, give to their favourites, they give without alloy-infinite
          joy, infinite sorrow--without alloy.</p>

        <p>It would be most unreasonable to blame Heine because he employs other and more violent
          methods than Goethe does--to say, for instance, of a poem like _Ein Jüngling liebt ein
          Mädchen_ ("A young man loves a maiden"), that Goethe would have shrunk from the
          grotesqueness of the bitter, desperate ending: "Und wem sie just passieret, Dem bricht das
          Herz entzwei" (And he to whom it happens, It breaks his heart in two). It would have been
          abhorrent to him <pb n="144"/> for much the same reason that it would have been abhorrent
          to an old Greek. What is simply new, simply _modern_ in the feeling, is justifiable. Even
          the grotesqueness is in this case artistically led up to.</p>

        <p>But at times the grotesque grimace is all that is left of the modern element. Take that
          famous poem: _Mein Herz, mein Herz ist traurig_ ("My heart, my heart is heavy"). It
          contains an admirable description of a wide landscape, viewed from the height of the old
          bastion. We see the blue town moat, with a boy fishing from a boat, and away on the other
          side of the moat, small and clear, we see summer-houses and gardens, men and oxen, meadows
          and woods, girls bleaching clothes, a turning mill-wheel sending out diamond dust, and at
          the foot of the old grey tower a sentry-box, with the sentry walking up and down, his gun
          flashing in the sunlight. H. C. Andersen, writing of this poem, remarks, "And the end is
          so _affecting_: 'Ich wollt', er schösse mich todt'" (I wish he would shoot me dead).
          Affecting? No. Startling; for nothing has prepared us for it. The ejaculation is possibly
          not entirely insincere; but it is so nervous that it is practically meaningless; it is in
          so far untruthful, that these big words only express a momentary mood, not a serious,
          determined desire.</p>

        <p>Goethe has expressed, if not longing for death, at least reconciliation to the idea of
          death, in the famous, immortal lines:</p>

        <p> "Ueber allen Gipfeln Ist Ruh. In allen Wipfeln Spürest du Kaum einen Hauch. Die Vögelein
          schweigen im Walde. Warte nur, balde Ruhest du auch."[7]</p>

        <p>[7]</p>

        <p> O'er all the hill tops Is quiet now, In all the tree tops Hearest thou Hardly a breath;
          The birds are asleep in the trees. Wait; soon like these Thou too shalt rest.
          (LONGFELLOW)</p>

        <p><pb n="145"/> It is unnecessary to direct attention to the contrast between the two
          poet-natures which is revealed by a comparison of this melody in words with Heine's
          discord; but note, from the purely artistic point of view, how marvellously in keeping all
          the different parts of the little poem are. It is one breath from the first word to the
          last: The calm of evening over the forest and in the human soul, the cessation of all
          desire, the resolution of all discords, the heart, great and tender, feeling itself one
          with all nature.</p>

        <p>Alongside of this perfection, the defects of Heine's lyric effect-style, in its
          occasional inartistic application, show up only too glaringly. It is akin, in its
          weaknesses, to the allegorising, fantastic style of the German Romanticists, from whom
          Heine, the poet, is lineally descended. And yet he is as far from being a genuine
          Romanticist as he is from being what some consider him, a genuine modern realist.</p>

        <p>He calls his _Atta Troll_ the last free forest ditty of Romance. Others have, in
          unfriendly criticism, called his poetry the decomposition process of Romance. "I wrote
          _Atta Troll_" he says, "for my own amusement, in the whimsical dream-style that prevailed
          in that Romantic school in which I passed the pleasantest years of my youth, and ended up
          by thrashing the schoolmaster." But in this case the Romanticism is really only the rich,
          glittering garment, in which the modern spirit masques, and which it finally throws off.
          None of the elements of Romance are wanting--animals talk, bears exchange ideas, we listen
          to a pug-dog's confidences, and we are conducted into a legendary region, the valley of
          Roncesvalles. Not even the blue flower is wanting:</p>

        <p> "Ronceval, du edles Thal, Wenn ich deinen Namen höre, Bebt und duftet mir im Herzen Die
          verscholl'ne blaue Blume."[8]</p>

        <p>[8]</p>

        <p> Ronceval, thou noble valley! Whensoe 'er I hear thy name, That blue flower so long
          departed O'er my spirit sheds its fragrance. (BOWRING)</p>

        <p>The dream-world reveals itself to us; great spirit eyes look into ours. The poet, with
          his guide, goes hunting in the <pb n="146"/> Pyrenees. This guide has an old mother, who
          is reputed to be a witch. We are introduced into the witch's hovel, with the stuffed
          birds, the ghost-like vultures, and at night bears and ghosts perform a burlesque and
          weird dance.</p>

        <p>The spirit as well as the style of this poem is Romantic to a certain point; there are
          declamations against the clumsy, didactic poetry of the day, against utilitarianism as
          applied to poetry, and there is literary satire (of Freiligrath, Karl Mayer, Gustav
          Pfizer) in the style favoured by the Romanticists.</p>

        <p>And yet there is sedulous realism in the representation of localities and circumstances.
          Strictly speaking, the poem is simply an account of a stay which Heine and a young French
          lady friend make at Cauterets in the Pyrenees, where they see a bear dance in the
          market-place. The bear escapes from his master, takes flight to the mountains, where he is
          hunted down, shot, and flayed by Laskaro, the guide. The poet's Juliette gets the skin to
          lay on the floor by her bed; and Heine gives us the superfluous information that many a
          night he himself has stood bare-footed on this same skin.</p>

        <p>So the tale is realistic enough. The details of the journey too are faithfully
          reproduced. We get the impression that Heine's description of the little mountain town up
          to which he clambered, and where the children danced in a circle to the accompaniment of
          their own singing, exactly corresponds with what he saw and heard. Even the refrain of the
          song: _Girofflino, Girofflette_, is doubtless the real one.</p>

        <p>Nevertheless the finest, most powerful parts of this poem are not in the least realistic.
          They are visions. And the finest vision is that in which by night from the window of the
          cottage the poet watches the whole Wild Hunt tear three times round the horizon. He never
          did finer figure-painting than the passage in which we follow the shining figures across
          the darkness of the night sky--Diana, the fairy Abunde, and the beautiful Herodias, in
          wild wantonness playing at ball with the Baptist's bloody head.</p>

        <p>A parallel may be drawn between Heine's art and that of Rembrandt. There is nothing
          academic about either of them; both bear the distinct stamp of modernity. But <pb n="147"
          /> when we call Heine a great realistic poet, we make an assertion of the same qualified
          truth as when we call Rembrandt the great colourist. Rembrandt cannot be said to be one of
          the greatest colour-realists, for the reason that several painters surpass him in the
          power of reproducing local colour and its exact value, and of showing the actual form and
          colour of an object seen in half darkness. It is not colour, but light, that is the main
          thing with Rembrandt.[9] To him light is life; the battle of life is the battle of light,
          and the tragedy of life is the tragedy of light, struggling and dying in damp and
          darkness. To indicate in what his real greatness as a painter lies, he ought rather to be
          called a luminist (an expression of Fromentin's) than a colourist, if by luminist we
          understand an artist whose specialty is the apprehension and treatment of light. He
          sometimes sacrifices drawing, even painting, in his eagerness to produce some effect of
          light. Think, for example, of the badly painted corpse in the _Lesson in Anatomy_. But it
          is exactly what makes him less successful than the realists in tasks requiring absolute
          truthfulness--the painting of hands, the exact reproduction of stuffs--that makes him so
          great when he causes light to express what it alone indicates to him, the inner life, the
          world of waking visions.</p>

        <p>[9] _Cf_. Fromentin: _Les maîtres d'autrefois_.</p>

        <p>Something similar to this is the case with Heine. How few real figures this great poet
          has bequeathed to us! Those who would measure his deserts by what he has done in this way
          find themselves obliged to fall back upon that crude, grotesque sketch of an old Jew
          servant, Hyacinth, as his best character.</p>

        <p>No, if Heine is to be judged by his pictures of real life, many an inferior poet
          surpasses him.</p>

        <p>But think of his visions, of the world of waking dreams in his poems and in his prose! As
          a rule he starts closer to earth than other poets, but presently, above the darkness of
          earth a gleaming vision appears--and disappears.</p>

        <p>This is felt even in such small poems as the one already referred to as containing the
          talk in the fisherman's cottage about the Ganges and Lapland.</p>

        <p><pb n="148"/> Think too of the way in which Heine calls up the image of Napoleon before
          his readers. In the _Two Grenadiers_ it has the effect of a vision. The words, "Dann
          reitet mein Kaiser wohl über mein Grab" ('Tis my Emperor riding, right over my grave), are
          like a revelation in the darkness of night, illuminated by the glitter of swords. In the
          equally admirable description in the _Reisebilder_, the vision is conjured up in the form
          of a recollection of childhood.</p>

        <p>Or remember how Heine brings the image of Jesus before us. In the poem _Frieden_
          ("Peace") he sees him, robed in glittering white, striding over the waves. In
          _Deutschland, ein Wintermärchen_ ("Germany, a Winter's Tale"), he paints a grey, winter
          morning on the Paderborn heath; when the mist rises, he sees by the side of the road, in
          the dawning light, a wooden crucifix with the image of the great enthusiast, who desired
          to save mankind, and now hangs there "as a warning to others."</p>

        <p> "Sie haben dir übel mitgespielt, Die Herren vom hohen Rathe."[10]</p>

        <p>[10]</p>

        <p> A sorry trick they played thee indeed, The lords of the council stately. (BOWRING)</p>

        <p>The heart-felt sadness, the bitter humour, that find expression in familiar, disparaging
          comment, heighten the impression of human grandeur, of solemn horror, much as this same
          impression is intensified when Hamlet, hearing his father's ghost under ground, calls:
          "Well said, old mole! Canst work i' the earth so fast?" In the flash of Heine's wit the
          reader sees Jesus, not now as the Prince of Peace, but as the man who scourged the
          desecrators of the Temple and sent fire upon earth.</p>

        <p>_The Winter 's Tale_ is, taken as a whole, a characteristic example of Heine's artistic
          procedure. All the twenty-seven divisions of the long poem are constructed on the same
          plan. They begin close to earth, materially, with reminiscences of travel, vulgar
          realistic impressions; then the writer, without warning, by unnoticeable transitions,
          rises to the height of passion, to powerful pathos, wild <pb n="149"/> contempt, glowing
          admiration, destructive or constructive enthusiasm, divine madness that, as it were, rolls
          thunderbolt on thunderbolt; and then all sinks back once more into the grey dulness of
          everyday events and situations.</p>

        <p>Heine arrives at Cologne, sups on an omelet and ham, drinks a bottle of Rhenish wine, and
          then saunters out into the streets. He calls the town's past days to mind: here the
          priests had free play, here men and books were burned at the stake; here stupidity and
          malice wantoned like dogs on the open street. Suddenly in the moonlight the Cathedral, the
          great spiritual Bastille, appears to his sight and arouses his wrath. As he saunters
          along, he catches sight of a figure behind him which it seems to him he ought to know. And
          now we glide into a perfectly new world, the world of vision. The figure follows him as if
          it were his shadow, stopping when he stops. He has often noticed it beside him before,
          when he sat late at night at his desk. Under its cloak it holds, and always has held,
          something that glitters strangely and that resembles an axe, an executioner's axe. This
          figure is the poet's lictor, who follows his master, instead of preceding him as the Roman
          lictor did.</p>

        <p>In the succeeding divisions Barbarossa reveals himself in the same visionary style,
          coming and going twice.</p>

        <p>Heine is an epoch-maker, not only in German lyric poetry, but in poetry in general. He
          introduced a new style, the combination of sentiment and humour in lyric poetry, and a new
          idea, the introduction of prose into poetry, either by way of foil or by way of parody.
          His position as epoch-maker is due to his historic position, to his having lived at the
          period when Romantic perversion of reality was giving way to pessimistic realism; this
          explains the fusion of the two elements which we find in his writings.</p>

        <p>Hence, too, it comes that the most characteristic domain in the province of his art is
          the domain of chiaroscuro, a chiaroscuro akin to Rembrandt's.</p>

        <p>To make the central objects stand out from the shadow or half-darkness in which they are
          concealed; to make light, natural light, produce a ghostly, supernatural effect by con<pb
            n="150"/>juring it forth from a sea of dark shadow-waves, bringing it flickering or
          flaring out of half-darkness; to make darkness penetrable, half-darkness transparent--this
          is Rembrandt's art.</p>

        <p>Heine's, which is closely related, consists in gradually, imperceptibly, conjuring forth
          out of the world of reality, and back into it again, a perfectly modern, fantastic
          dreamworld.</p>

        <p>At times the vision is in a full blaze of light, and the reality hidden in black
          darkness; but presently the vision fades, and the reality gradually emerges into the
          light.</p>

        <head>HEINE AND GOETHE</head>

        <p>It has already been mentioned that Heine, when a student in Bonn, conceived an
          enthusiastic admiration for the founder of the Romantic school. A. W. Schlegel's
          personality was as attractive to him as his teaching. In Schlegel, Heine admired the man
          who had guided German poetry from artificiality to truth. He was dazzled, too, by the
          fashionable professor's aristocratic bearing, his knowledge of the world, his acquaintance
          with the good society and famous people of the day.</p>

        <p>He was also touched by the kindly interest which Schlegel showed in himself and his first
          literary efforts. It was to Schlegel that he was indebted for his early initiation into
          the secrets of metrical art, and for something more valuable still, confidence in his own
          powers and his future.</p>

        <p>In Heine's first prose article, that on Romanticism, written in 1820, he expresses his
          gratitude and makes his Romantic confession of faith in the same breath. He protests
          against the idea of Romanticism being "a mixture of Spanish enamel, Scotch mists, and
          Italian jingle"; no, Romantic poetry ought not to be obscure and vague; its images may be
          as plastic in contour as those of classic poetry. "Hence it is," he writes, "that our two
          greatest Romanticists, Goethe and A. W. Schlegel, are at the same time our greatest
          plastic artists." And he names Goethe's _Faust_ and Schlegel's _Rome_ in the same breath,
          as models of plastic outline, concluding pathetically: "O, that those who love to call
          themselves Schlegelians would lay this to heart!" This passage should be noted by those
          whose only knowledge of Heine's connection with Schlegel is derived from the low attack on
          the latter's private life in _Die Romantische Schule_. It was to A. W. Schlegel, moreover,
            <pb n="152"/> that Heine addressed his three first sonnets. In the earliest he thanks
          him for his personal kindness, and declares his own great indebtedness to him; in the
          second he extols him for the service which he has rendered to German poetry by banishing
          that caricature in hoop and patches which in his day figured as the Muse; in the third he
          praises him for his introduction of English, Spanish, early German, Italian, and Indian
          poetry into modern German literature. The tone is enthusiastic:</p>

        <p> "Der schlimmste Wurm: des Zweifels Dolchgedanken, Das schlimmste Gift: an eigner Kraft
          verzagen, Das wollt' mir fast des Lebens Mark zernagen; Ich war ein Reis, dem seine
          Stützen sanken.</p>

        <p> Da mochtest du das arme Reis beklagen, An deinem güt'gen Wort lässt du es ranken, Und
          dir, mein hoher Meister, soll ich's danken, Wird einst das schwache Reislein Blüthen
          tragen," &amp;c.[1]</p>

        <p>[1] The most dangerous worm--doubt, with its dagger tooth; the most deadly
          poison--distrust of one's own powers, were eating away my life; I was a sapling bereft of
          its supports.</p>

        <p>Thou hadst pity on the poor sapling, thou gavest it the support of encouraging word; if
          ever the weak sapling blossoms, thine, great master, be the praise.</p>

        <p>It is under this first Romantic influence that Heine writes his earliest, purely Romantic
          poems in archaistic style, verses like:</p>

        <p> "Die du bist so schön und rein, Wunnevolles Magedein, Deinem Dienste ganz allein Möcht'
          ich wohl mein Leben weihn.</p>

        <p> Deine süssen Aeugelein Glänzen mild wie Mondenschein, Helle Rosenlichter streun Deine
          rothen Wängelein."</p>

        <p>This reminds us forcibly of Tieck's earliest verses, those introduced into his tales. In
          the one little poem from which these stanzas are taken, we come upon Wunne, Magedein,
          Aeugelein, Wängelein, Mündchen, weiland, a whole string of diminutives and archaisms.</p>

        <p><pb n="153"/> Heine's next model was a genial, true poet, who died in 1827, at the early
          age of thirty-one--Wilhelm Müller, the author of the _Müllerlieder_, particularly well
          known from Schubert's musical setting, and of the _Griechenlieder_, which were equally
          admired in their day. A son of Wilhelm Müller's is the well-known German-English
          philologist, Max Müller, whose novel, _Deutsche Liebe_, the story of the tender love of a
          young German savant for a sickly, bedridden princess, is said to be based on events in his
          father's life.</p>

        <p>On the 7th of June 1826, Heine writes to Müller: "I am magnanimous enough to confess
          frankly that the resemblance of my little Intermezzo metre [the one most frequently
          employed by Heine] to your usual metre is not purely accidental; the secret of its cadence
          was in all probability learned from your verses." He goes on to explain that he had early
          felt the influence of the German popular ballad and song, and that at Bonn, Schlegel had
          initiated him into the art of verses; "but," he adds, "it is in your verse that I seem for
          the first time to have found the clear ring, the true simplicity, which I have always
          aimed at. How clear, how simple your poems are, and they are one and all popular poems. In
          mine only the form is popular; the ideas are those of conventional society."</p>

        <p>It was from Müller that Heine first learned how to evolve new popular forms out of the
          old. To behold as it were with our own eyes the birth and growth of Heine's style, we only
          need to set certain of his verses alongside of Müller's.</p>

        <p>Müller writes:</p>

        <p> "Wir sassen so traulich beisammen Im kühlen Erlendach, Wir schauten so traulich zusammen
          Hinab in den rieselnden Bach."</p>

        <p>And Heine:</p>

        <p> "Wir sassen am Fischerhause Und schauten nach der See, Die Abendnebel kamen Und stiegen
          in die Höh'."</p>

        <p><pb n="154"/> How closely this last stanza resembles such a stanza of Müller's as:</p>

        <p> "Die Abendnebel sinken Hernieder kalt und schwer, Und Todesengel schweben In ihren Dampf
          umher."[2]</p>

        <p>[2] Wilhelm Müller: _Gedichte_, i. p. 26; "Thränenregen," p. 194; "Dasselbe noch
          einmal."</p>

        <p>These are the introductory lines of a long, beautiful poem called _Hirtenbiwouak in der
          römischen Campagna_, the most important part of which is the shepherd's song of longing
          for his sweetheart. How much Heine must have learned from such a verse as that which
          describes the young girl:</p>

        <p> "Darunter sitzt ein Mädchen, Die Spindel in der Hand, Und spinnt und sinnt und schauet
          Herab in's eb'ne Land."</p>

        <p>We do not find Wilhelm Müller marring the impression of his idyll by any sudden revulsion
          of mood; there is nothing of the devil in him; the gentle andante is maintained to the end
          of the piece. But it is not in this that the principal difference between his style and
          Heine's lies; for Heine at times retains his tranquil mood throughout a whole poem. The
          essential difference is the extraordinary condensation of Heine's style, as compared with
          Müller's. He gives in one verse, at most two, what the other requires ten to express.</p>

        <p>The novelty in his lyric style is its unparalleled condensation. The poems are all
          epitomes. They present us with a spiced, fragrant essence of passion, experience,
          bitterness, mockery, wit, emotion, and fancy; an essence of poetry and prose in
          combination. Psychologists talk of a condensation of thought;[3] in comparison with the
          pupil's thought, the master's is condensed. In the history of all mechanism, increasing
          condensation is to be observed. Once there were only church clocks; now people carry
          clocks in their pockets. That is to say, the mechanism which once required for its wheels
          and springs the space provided by a church clock, now finds room enough in <pb n="155"/> a
          watch. In like manner, many an old tragedy does not contain more thoughts or more feeling
          than a Heine poem of two or three verses.</p>

        <p>[3] Lazarus: _Das Leben der Seele_, 2nd edition, p. 229.</p>

        <p>Heine's short stanza has, then, two advantages over Wilhelm Müllers--more passion, and
          much greater condensation of style.</p>

        <p>In his favourite short iambic metre, Heine is influenced by Wilhelm Müller, in his
          trochees he resembles another Romantic, far more Romantic poet, Clemens Brentano. In
          Heine's _Romancero_ there are some curious correspondences with Brentano's _Romanzen vom
          Rosenkranze_ ("Romances of the Rosary"). These latter were written before _Romancero_, but
          as they were not published till 1853, Heine cannot possibly have been influenced by
          them.</p>

        <p>In the second of the _Rosary Romances_ we read of the hero, Cosmo, that:</p>

        <p> "Aus dem Wasserspiegel mahnt Ihn des Alters ernste Bote: Du wirst bald die Schuld
          bezahlen, Spricht des Hauptes Silberlocke."[4]</p>

        <p>[4] The solemn messengers of age, the white locks of the man who gazes at him from the
          water-mirror, cry: Soon thou must pay thy debt.</p>

        <p>In Heine's posthumous poem _Bimini_, one of the divisions begins:</p>

        <p> "Einsam auf dem Strand von Cuba, Vor dem stillen Wasserspiegel, Steht ein Mensch und er
          betrachtet In der Flut sein Konterfei.</p>

        <p> Eben nicht mit sonderlichem Wohlgefallen scheint der Greis In dem Wasser zu betrachten
          Sein bekümmert Spiegelbildniss."[5]</p>

        <p>[5]</p>

        <p> On the shore of Cuba's island Stands an old man solitary, Gazing at his own reflection
          In the tranquil water-mirror.</p>

        <p> Not with any special pleasure Does the sad and aged man See beneath him in the water His
          own image, sorrowful.</p>

        <p>Metre, situation, idea are identical in the two passages.</p>

        <p><pb n="156"/> There is also a certain resemblance between the tale of a mystery-book in
          the Ninth Romance of the Rosary and the story of the beautiful casket in Heine's poem of
          _Jehuda ben Halevy_.[6] Only that Brentano's story of the passing of the mystery-book from
          hand to hand, through many ages, merely opens up to us a Romantic wonder-world, whereas
          Heine's tale of the wanderings of the casket is at the same time a jest at the
          vicissitudes of life: the pearls first belong to Smerdis, who gives them to Atossa, then
          to the great Alexander, who gives them to Thais, then in course of time to Cleopatra, to a
          Moorish sultan, to the regalia of Castille, and to the Baroness Solomon Rothschild, in a
          compliment to whom the life-history of the casket terminates.</p>

        <p>[6] _Cf_. Eduard Grisebach; _Die deutsche Litteratur_, p. 254, &amp;c.; where, however, a
          definite influence is insisted on, regardless of Heine's priority.</p>

        <p>It is quite certain that Heine is indebted to Clemens Brentano for the subject of what in
          Germany is the best known and most sung of all his songs, the song of _Lorelei_, "Ich
          weiss nicht was soll es bedeuten."</p>

        <p>As far back as 1802 Brentano had published, in his _Godwi,_ a ballad entitled "Lorelei."
          It is not the story of a siren, but of a young girl of Bacharach on the Rhine, who was so
          beautiful that all men fell in love with her. She was accused of witchcraft. But the
          bishop, who ought to have condemned her to be burned, fell in love with her himself. She
          desires to die, for the one man she loves will have nothing to say to her and has gone
          away; so, on her way to the convent to which the bishop is sending her, she climbs a high
          cliff, Lurelei (Ley means slate-rock), and in despairing longing for her beloved, throws
          herself into the Rhine.</p>

        <p>This ballad suggested to a writer called Nikolaus Vogt the fabrication of a Rhine legend,
          which he published in 1811, passing it off as an old one. In it Lorelei, on her way to the
          convent, sees the man of her heart sail past her on the Rhine, and throws herself from the
          cliff in grief at having failed to win him. Three of her adorers follow her to a watery
          grave. Hence a rock in that neighbourhood <pb n="157"/> is known by the name of the
          Dreiritterstein (Rock of the Three Knights). The last incident was perhaps suggested by
          the ending of Brentano's poem:</p>

        <p> "Wer hat dies' Lied gesungen? Ein Schiffer auf dem Rhein. Und immer hat geklungen Vom
          hohen Felsenstein: Lore Lay! Lore Lay! Lore Lay! Als wären es unser Drei."[7]</p>

        <p>[7] Who was it sang this song? A boatman on the Rhine. And still we heard the cry, from
          the high cliff overhead: "Lore Lay! Lore Lay! Lore Lay!" Me-seemed that we were three.</p>

        <p>From this fabricated legend a certain Count Loeben, in 1821, took the theme for a poem,
          _Lorelei_,[8] in which the young girl who drowns herself is transformed into a mermaid,
          whose singing lures into the depths those who are sailing past:</p>

        <p> "Da wo der Mondschein blitzet Um's hohe Felsgestein, Das Zauberfräulein sitzet Und
          schauet auf den Rhein.</p>

        <p> Es schauet herüber, hinüber, Es schauet hinab, hinauf, Die Schifflein ziehen vorüber,
          Lieb' Knabe, sieh nicht auf!</p>

        <p> Sie singt dir hold am Ohre, Sie blickt dich thöricht an, Sie ist die schöne Lore, Sie
          hat dir's angethan," &amp;c.[9]</p>

        <p>[8] A. Strodtmann: H. Heine's _Leben und Werke_, 2nd edition, i. 696.</p>

        <p>[9] Where the moonlight glitters on the lofty cliff, there the magic-maiden sits, and
          gazes on the Rhine. She looks across the stream, looks up the stream and down; softly the
          boats glide past-look not on her, O youth! She sings so sweetly in your ear, she looks at
          you bewitchingly; she is the lovely Lore, and in her spells you're caught.</p>

        <p>Now take Heine's world-famed poem, first a students' song, then a popular song, melting
          and thrilling with the tender harmony of melody and words. The direct imitation is
          unmistakable. The theme is the same, the metre is the <pb n="158"/> same, even some of the
          rhymes are the same: "blitzet--sitzet;" instead of "an--gethan, Kahn--gethan." But what a
          difference! Feeling has been added. First the personal starting-point, the inexplicable
          melancholy of the narrator and his inability to banish the old legend from his thoughts,
          then the instantaneous, clear, definite picture of the landscape:</p>

        <p> "Die Luft ist kühl, und es dunkelt, Und ruhig fliesst der Rhein, Der Gipfel des Berges
          funkelt Im Abendsonnenschein.</p>

        <p> Die schönste Jungfrau sitzet Dort oben wunderbar, Ihr gold'nes Geschmeide blitzet, Sie
          kämmt ihr goldenes Haar."[10]</p>

        <p>[10]</p>

        <p> The cool air darkens, and listen, How softly flows the Rhine! The mountain peaks still
          glisten Where the evening sunbeams shine.</p>

        <p> The fairest maid sits dreaming In radiant beauty there. Her gold and her jewels are
          gleaming, She combeth her golden hair. (E. LAZARUS.)</p>

        <p>And something more has been added--that element of dæmonic passion which the earlier
          manipulators of the theme were unable to communicate to it. Heine here represents an
          elemental luring power, akin to that delineated with simpler means and more powerful
          effect by Goethe in _Der Fischer_. But Goethe, in conformity with his nature, describes a
          tranquil, enchanting ensnarement; Heine, in conformity with his, an instantaneous,
          irresistible, maddening bewitchment.</p>

        <p>A still more profound insight into Heine's art, in the making, and into the manner in
          which his fancy deals with a theme, is perhaps to be gained by observing how he makes use
          of a subject which offers itself to him in prose.</p>

        <p>In Henri Beyle's book, _De l'amour_, he evidently found the three following anecdotes,
          translated from the Arabic. 1. Sahid ben Agba one day asked an Arab: "Of what <pb n="159"
          /> tribe art thou?" "Of that tribe," answered the Arabian, "in which men die when they
          love." "Then thou art of the tribe of Asra?" "Yea, verily, by the Lord of Kaaba!" "Whence
          comes it that ye love thus?" "Our women are beautiful, and our young men chaste." 2. A man
          once asked Arua ben Hezam of the tribe of Asra: "Is it true that ye love with a tenderness
          surpassing that of all other men?" "It is true," answered Arua. "Thirty young men of my
          tribe have I seen carried off by death, whose only sickness was that of love." 3. An Arab
          of the tribe Beni-Fazarat said one day to an Arab of the tribe Beni-Asra: "Ye think that
          to die of love is a sweet and noble death; whereas it is nought but weakness and
          foolishness." "Thou would'st not speak so," answered the other, "had'st thou seen the
          great dark, long-lashed eyes of our veiled women, seen their teeth gleam between their
          brown lips when they smile."</p>

        <p>Here we have the origin of Heine's famous _Der Asra_: "Täglich ging die wunderschöne." He
          first paints the place for us--the garden with the fountain whose white waters flash; then
          he shows us the slave, standing there every day when the sultan's daughter comes to walk,
          paler every day; then he tells how the princess one evening closely questions the slave:
          "I would know thy name, thy race, thy family...":</p>

        <p> "Und der Sklave sprach: 'ich heisse Mohamet, ich bin aus Yemen Und mein Stamm sind jene
          Asra, Welche sterben, wenn sie lieben.'"[11]</p>

        <p>[11]</p>

        <p> Spake the youthful slave, "My name is Mahomet, I come from Yemen; And by birth I am an
          Asra, One who dieth when he loves." (E. LAZARUS.)</p>

        <p>Heine, as we see, has disdained all explanations. We enjoy the marvellous conciseness of
          these monumental words, this power as it were of hewing out the speech in stone. But what,
          on closer investigation, is the spiritual substance of the poem? Not much more than a
          laconic combination of the words love and death. It is the same <pb n="160"/> combination
          that is to be found in all Heine's youthful poems, in the shape of love and suffering,
          love and poison, love and suicide--in Alfred de Musset, too, there is the same stereotyped
          coupling of _l'amour_ and _la mort_.</p>

        <p>Here, as in general with Heine, the expression is epigrammatic, therefore quite
          simple.</p>

        <p>We have now sufficient material before us to give us a certain insight into the formation
          of Heine's poetic style. It will be interesting to study it finished and fully
          developed.</p>

        <p>We may start from the last-mentioned poem with its epigrammatic point. It is
          characteristic of Heine that neither here nor elsewhere does he deeply concern himself
          with the true inwardness of a feeling; he only, as a rule, points and sharpens the
          expression of it. This is the case even with the feeling of love, which he has treated
          more frequently than any other. And it is characteristic of his want of the power to put
          himself in another's place, that it has only been possible for him to give expression to
          masculine love; he has never put a passionate utterance of feeling into the mouth of a
          woman.</p>

        <p>Nothing would have been more impossible for Heine than to write such a poem as Goethe's
          famous:</p>

        <p> "Freudvoll und leidvoll, Gedankenvoll sein, Langen und bangen In schwebender Pein,
          Himmelhoch jauchzend, Zum Tode betrübt, Glücklich allein Ist die Seele die liebt."[12]</p>

        <p>[12]</p>

        <p> Gladness And sadness And pensiveness blending; Yearning And burning In torment ne'er
          ending; Sad unto death, Proudly soaring above, Happy alone Is the soul that doth love.
          (BOWRING)</p>

        <p><pb n="161"/> For this is the living delineation of a woman's heart, this is the very
          inner life of love, its pulsation, its oscillation between bliss and woe. The epigrammatic
          quality of Heine's style alone would make such an unfolding of the emotional life
          impossible. And there is the same concentration when he narrates an event. It is a
          condensation without parallel in poetry; he produces his effect by making the briefest
          possible statement or suggestion. As an example of this take the lines:</p>

        <p> "Es war ein alter König, Sein Herz war schwer, sein Haupt war grau; Der arme, alte König
          Er nahm eine junge Frau.</p>

        <p> Es war ein schöner Page, Blond war sein Haupt, leicht war sein Sinn, Er trug die seid'ne
          Schleppe Der jungen Königin."[13]</p>

        <p>[13]</p>

        <p> There was an aged monarch, His heart was sad, his head was grey; This foolish, fond old
          monarch A young wife took one day.</p>

        <p> There was a handsome page, too, Fair was his hair and light his mien; The silken train
          he carried Of the beautiful young queen.</p>

        <p>Observe the telling effect of the inversion: "Blond war sein Haupt;" it is as if the
          verse began to rejoice and dance. Then comes the end:</p>

        <p> "Kennst du das alte Liedchen? Es klingt so süss, es klingt so trüb; Sie mussten beide
          sterben, Sie hatten sich viel zu lieb."[14]</p>

        <p>[14]</p>

        <p> Dost know the ancient ballad? It sounds so sweet, it sounds so sad: Both of them had to
          perish Too much love to each other they had.</p>

        <p>This is admirable. But we are not told the story; we only suspect it as we suspect the
          story of the slave and the sultan's daughter. And here again love is coupled with
          death.</p>

        <p><pb n="162"/> A certain emptiness in Heine's conception of love strikes us here again.
          This love has no real substance, no spiritual significance. It was not till shortly before
          he lay down upon his death-bed that Heine began to describe a love that has real inward
          substance. The love of the _Buch der Lieder_ is for the most part wrath excited by
          coldness or faithlessness, an unfruitful thing, that awakens no sympathy. The later of the
          love-poems are frequently sensual or frivolous, and the more exaggerated the expression,
          the less are we affected by the value of the feeling:</p>

        <p> "Mein Herz ist wie die Sonne, So flammend anzuseh'n. Und in ein Meer von Liebe Versinkt
          es gross und schön."[15]</p>

        <p>15:</p>

        <p> My heart is like the sun, dear, Yon kindled flame above; And sinks in large-orbed beauty
          Within a sea of love. (E. LAZARUS.)</p>

        <p>There is too much self-observation and too much boastfulness in this youthful
          rodomontade. And it is the same with:</p>

        <p> "Ich hab' dich geliebet und liebe dich noch, Und fiele die Welt zusammen, Aus ihren
          Trummern stiegen doch Hervor meiner Liebe Flammen."[16]</p>

        <p>16:</p>

        <p> I have loved thee long, and I love thee now, And, though the world should perish, O'er
          its dying embers still would glow The flames of the love I cherish. (LELAND)</p>

        <p>Admitting that this is probably so expressed for the sake of artistic effect, we must
          also admit that the style is a good, perfectly modern style. We can see it all with the
          mind's eye. The heart sinks like the sun into a sea. From the ruins of the world rise the
          flames of love. And still more powerful and much more picturesque is the scene in which
          the name of Agnes is written on the vault of heaven. What is wanting is substance in the
          feeling. Think, for <pb n="163"/> the sake of comparison, of those profoundly human lines
          of Goethe's:</p>

        <p> "Kanntest jeden Zug in meinem Wesen, Spähtest, wo die reinste Nerve klingt, Konntest
          mich mit einem Blicke lesen, Den so schwer ein sterblich Aug' durchdringt."[17]</p>

        <p>[17] Thou knewest every impulse of my nature, thine eye detected where the nerve thrilled
          keenest, thou couldst read me at a glance, me, so impenetrable to mortal eye.</p>

        <p>--or of the following, which complete the impression:</p>

        <p> "Tropftest Mässigung dem heissen Blute, Richtetest den wilden, wirren Lauf, Und in
          deinen Engelsarmen ruhte Die zerstörte Brust sich wieder auf."[18]</p>

        <p>[18] The hot blood by thee was tempered, the wild, aimless course by thee directed; and
          in thine angel arms the torn breast found rest and healing.</p>

        <p>This is the expression of the healthiest, fullest, mutual sympathy, of love's gratitude,
          of perfect understanding. For such feeling Heine did not find expression until, with the
          shadow of death upon him, he loved _la Mouche_, the guardian angel of his death-bed. Until
          then it is never the healthy, tranquillising, happy element in love that he concerns
          himself with. It is in another domain that he is master. The modern poet, he reproduces
          passionate desire with a Correggio-like blending of colours and tones that is more
          effective than Goethe's antique limpidity. With Goethe desire is Greek or Italian. Think,
          for instance, of the poem of the orange:</p>

        <p> "Ich trete zu dem Baume Und sage: Pomeranze! Du reife Pomeranze; Du süsse Pomeranze! Ich
          schüttle, fühl', ich schüttle, O fall in meinen Schoos!"[19]</p>

        <p>[19]</p>

        <p> I take my stand beneath the tree, And cry: O orange! O orange ripe! O orange sweet!
          Feel, feel how I shake thy tree! O fall into my lap</p>

        <p><pb n="164"/> Then compare the feeling, the glow, the fragrance, the exuberance of such a
          poem of desire as Heine's wonderful: _Die Lotosblume ängstigt sich vor der Sonne Pracht_
          ("The lotus-flower is fearful of the sun's resplendent beam").</p>

        <p>It is very characteristic of the two poets that (as has already been noted), whenever the
          representation of love-longing glides into a delineation of foreign lands, Goethe prefers
          to paint Italy, Heine Hindostan. In Mignon's song of longing, without a superlative or a
          diminutive, with a power like that of a God, Goethe summons before our eyes the picture of
          the classic land where the citrons bloom. There is a power in it all, a force in each
          distinguishing trait, that Heine does not attain to. But compare this with the bewitching
          sweetness of Heine's _Auf Flügeln des Gesanges_ ("Oh, I would bear thee, my love, my
          bride, afar on the wings of song"), the dreamy longing, the charm and the mystery of the
          perspective that opens out to us:</p>

        <p> "Es hüpfen herbei und lauschen Die frommen, klugen Gazelln, Und in der Ferne rauschen
          Des heiligen Stromes Welln."[20]</p>

        <p>[20]</p>

        <p> Gazelles come bounding from the brake, And pause, and look shyly round; And the waves of
          the sacred river make A far-off slumb'rous sound. (Sir THEODORE MARTIN)</p>

        <p>This is an immortal stanza. Goethe, even when he gives the reins to longing, is always,
          like his own goldsmith of Ephesus, the great, wise heathen, who makes images of the gods;
          in Heine's visionary brain there was that particle of divine frenzy without which it had
          been impossible for the Düsseldorf merchant's son to understand and reproduce the
          fatalistic, self-effacing dreaminess of ancient India.</p>

        <p>Heine's peculiarities of style stand out even more sharply against the background of
          Goethe's, when we compare the way in which the two give expression to what is not exactly
          desire, but the pure longing of love.</p>

        <p>Think of the following lines, which Goethe puts into Mignon's mouth:</p>

        <p><pb n="165"/> "Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt, weiss was ich leide, Allein und abgetrennt
          von aller Freude, Seh' ich an's Firmament nach jener Seite. Ach, der mich liebt und kennt,
          ist in der Weite.-- Es schwindelt mir, es brennt mein Eingeweide. Nur wer die Sehnsucht
          kennt, weiss was ich leide."[21]</p>

        <p>21:</p>

        <p> My grief no mortals know, except the yearning! Alone, a prey to woe, all pleasure
          spurning, Up towards the sky I throw a gaze discerning. He who my love doth know seems
          ne'er returning; With strange and fiery glow _my heart is burning_[*] My grief no mortals
          know, except the yearning. (BOWRING)</p>

        <p>[*]In the original, _my bowels are burning_.</p>

        <p>This is the master in the fulness of his power. Much art has been expended in the
          representation of the wearing monotony of longing--the five doubly rhyming lines, the
          languishing metre--interrupted by the audacious, realistic expression: "Es schwindelt mir,
          es brennt mein Eingeweide." Now compare with this, one of Heine's most perfect expressions
          of pure love-longing, and we shall see what the plastic fancy and the perfected laconicism
          of style which we traced in course of development have succeeded in producing for time and
          eternity:</p>

        <p> "Ein Fichtenbaum steht einsam Im Norden auf kahler Höh'. Ihn schläfert: mit weisser
          Decke Umhüllen ihn Eis und Schnee.</p>

        <p> Er träumt von einer Palme, Die fern im Morgenland Einsam und schweigend trauert Auf
          brennender Felsenwand."[22]</p>

        <p>[22]</p>

        <p> A pine-tree stands alone on A bare bleak northern height; The ice and snow they swathe
          it As it sleeps there, all in white.</p>

        <p> 'Tis dreaming of a palm-tree, In a far-off Eastern land, That mourns, alone and silent,
          On a ledge of burning sand. (Sir THEODORE MARTIN.)</p>

        <p><pb n="166"/> This is hardly rhymed. The only real rhyme is the very commonplace _Land_
          and _Wand_. The pine dreams in the snow, the palm grieves dumbly in the burning heat--that
          is all. It is not seen, it is fancied or invented, hence it cannot be painted (though I
          did once see a painting of it in a German exhibition, an idiotically absurd, double
          picture); but it is, nevertheless, an unforgettable, an immortal poem. And the reason is
          that the symbol is so marvellously effective in its simplicity--these two clear outlines
          instinct with feeling, which express the impossibility of overcoming the obstacle which
          prevents the union of two who really belong to each other.</p>

        <p>If Goethe's strength lies in the expression of healthy feelings, comparatively simple and
          uncomplicated, Heine's lies in the expression of complex modern feeling, of feelings whose
          unsound state is the result of painful experiences. Goethe could never have written the
          following lines, with their jarring contrasts and enigmatical meaning:</p>

        <p> "Wenn ich in deine Augen seh' So schwindet all mein Leid und Weh: . . . . . . . . . . .
          Doch wenn du sprichst: ich liebe dich! So muss ich weinen bitterlich."[23]</p>

        <p>[23]</p>

        <p> Whene'er I look into thine eyes, Then every fear that haunts me flies: . . . . . . . . .
          . . But when thou sayest: "I love thee;" Then must I weep, and bitterly. (Sir THEODORE
          MARTIN)</p>

        <p>Why must he weep? I have heard the naïve answer: Because she is lying. Alas! it is not
          such a simple matter as that. He has heard these words from other lips, lips which have
          now ceased to utter words of love; he knows how long such a passion as a rule lasts, and
          the sound of her voice startles him out of his forgetfulness--he doubts the durability of
          her feeling or the durability of his own. It is very interesting to note the way in which
          Heine had wrestled with these words. Originally the last line <pb n="167"/> was: "Dann
          wein' ich still und bitterlich." Then the word "bitterlich" was altered to "freudiglich,"
          which changed the original tenor of the poem, and finally the line received its present
          form.[24]</p>

        <p>[24] H. Hüffer: _Aus dem Leben Heinrich Heines,_ p. 153.</p>

        <p>Heine was not happy enough and not great enough to attain to reconciliation with
          existence. It was not possible, apart from all else, that the man who was so long an
          exile, so long sick to death, should look upon life with the same eyes as the man who was
          thoroughly sound and healthy, in affluent circumstances, honoured by the great majority,
          the friend of his sovereign. Hence the expressions of revolt, of bitterness, and of
          cynicism so frequently to be found in Heine are exceedingly rare in Goethe. Goethe, as a
          rule, puts them into the mouth of his Mephistopheles. Heine, who was destitute of the
          dramatic faculty, is himself responsible for every outburst, because he always speaks in
          his own name. Goethe's bitterest utterances, moreover, are not contained in his works. It
          is only in the Paralipomena to _Faust_, for instance, that we find this passage:</p>

        <p> "Nach kurzem Lärm legt Fama sich zur Ruh, Vergessen wird der Held so wie der Lotterbube,
          Der grösste König schliesst die Augen zu, Und jeder Hund bepisst gleich seine
          Grube."[25]</p>

        <p>[25]</p>

        <p> Fame's short-liv'd turmoil o'er, she sleeps, Hero and waif, oblivion's their doom; The
          greatest king, life o'er, his eyes doth close, And straightway every dog defiles his
          tomb.</p>

        <p>Heine dwells upon the ideas which Goethe only calls up to banish again. Goethe, too, can
          be blasphemous. He wrote that poem which is so frequently quoted, so seldom understood:
          _Wer nie sein Brod mit Thränen ass_ ("He that with tears did never eat his bread"). It is
          a bitter, passionate appeal against the ordering of the world. But its bitterness is a
          bitterness that is choked with tears, not the wild and desperate bitterness of Heine's
          splendid _Fragen_ <pb n="168"/> ("Questions") or the poem _Lass die heiligen Parabeln_
          ("Holy parable discarding"), in which occur the lines:</p>

        <p> "Warum schleppt sich blutend, elend, Unter Kreuzlast der Gerechte, Während glücklich als
          ein Sieger Trabt auf hohem Ross der Schlechte?</p>

        <p> Also fragen wir beständig, Bis man uns mit einer Handvoll Erde endlich stopft die
          Mäuler, Aber ist das eine Antwort?"[26]</p>

        <p>[26]</p>

        <p> Wherefore bends the Just One, bleeding 'Neath the cross's weight laborious, While upon
          his steed the Wicked Rides all-proudly and victorious?</p>

        <p> Thus are we for ever asking, Till at length our mouths securely With a clod of earth are
          fastened-- That is not an answer, surely? (BOWRING)</p>

        <p>The expression is here, as usual with Heine, on a lower plane, more terrestrial, more
          boldly outspoken, yet by no means unworthy of the subject.</p>

        <p>Outbursts of satiety and weariness of life are not infrequent with him. We do not need to
          search long among his poems to find expressions of the mood of having done for good and
          all with principle, with endeavour. Nothing of this kind is to be found in Goethe. His
          _Vanitas vanitatum_, the song _Ich hab' meine Sache auf Nichts gestellt_ ("My trust in
          nothing now is placed") has, very significantly, become a convivial drinking song. In
          other words, there is no real, bitter earnest about Goethe's desperation; therefore it
          soon changes into jovial recklessness. Goethe has not Heine's overpowering feeling of the
          misery of life, and in so far he is really less Christian.</p>

        <p>If it is instructive to compare the two poets' lyric expression of fatalistic
          indifference, it is equally so to compare their expression of the feeling of aspiration,
          of manly resolve. In this case we may take the song _Feiger Gedanken_ ("Cowardly
          Thoughts") from _Claudine von Villa Bella_, as characteristic of <pb n="169"/> Goethe; it
          might serve as a motto for his conduct throughout life. One can hardly imagine a more
          vigorous expression of manly determination than that of the lines: "Allen Gewalten zum
          Trutz sich erhalten," &amp;c. (A bold front shown, to powers of earth and heaven).</p>

        <p>Compare with this Heine's poem, _An die Jungen_ ("To the Young"). The impetuous rush of
          the rhythm and the picturesque quadruple rhyme would alone suffice to make this a
          splendid, fascinating composition. The first verse, with its allusion to the golden apples
          which Hippomenes dropped in front of Atalanta, is a whole poem in itself:</p>

        <p> "Lass dich nicht kirren, lass dich nicht wirren Durch goldne Aepfel in deinem Lauf. Die
          Schwerter klirren, die Pfeile schwirren, Doch halten sie nicht den Helden auf."[27]</p>

        <p>[27] Heed not the confusion, resist the illusion Of golden apples that lie in thy way!
          The swords are clashing, the arrows are flashing, But they cannot long the hero delay.
          (BOWRING.)</p>

        <p>From the picture and example of the hero, who will not be stopped in his career, we pass
          to that of Alexander. What is wanted is determination and boldness:</p>

        <p> "Ein kühnes Beginnen ist halbes Gewinnen, Ein Alexander erbeutet die Welt, Kein langes
          Besinnen! Die Königinnen Erwarten schon kniend den Sieger im Zelt.</p>

        <p> Wir wagen und werben! besteigen als Erben Des alten Darius' Bett und Thron. O süsses
          Verderben! o blühender Sterben! Berauschter Triumphtod zu Babylon!"[28]</p>

        <p>28:</p>

        <p> A daring beginning is half way to winning, An Alexander once conquered the earth!
          Restrain each soft feeling! the queens are all kneeling In the tent, to reward thy
          victorious worth.</p>

        <p> Surmounting each burden, we win as our guerdon The bed of Darius of old, and his crown;
          O deadly seduction! O blissful destruction! To die drunk with triumph in Babylon town.
          (BOWRING.)</p>

        <p><pb n="170"/> Upon victory follows the homage of the queens, then sweet perdition,
          seductive ruin, death in the intoxication of triumph--what Sardanapalian sentiment in this
          appeal to youth, this exhortation to relentless determination! The fight here is for
          honour, and for women as the spoil of battle, not that struggle for the combatant's own
          individual freedom, of which Goethe writes so simply:</p>

        <p> "Nimmer sich beugen, Kräftig sich zeigen, Rufet die Arme Der Götter herbei."[29]</p>

        <p>29:</p>

        <p> Nevermore yield thee! Show life has steeled thee! Thus call the arms of The Gods to
          thine aid.</p>

        <p>Goethe's feeling is purer and fuller, the music of his language is simpler; with Heine
          the melody is, as it were, gorgeously orchestrated. In Goethe's case there is nothing for
          the eye, not a single picture. It is characteristic that his idea is the grander, Heine's
          the more modern, more complex, just as Heine's metrical expression is more sensuously
          insinuating, produced by an art which devotes more attention to detail.</p>

        <p>Now take a picturesque, descriptive subject--the Three Kings of the East, as they are
          called to mind at the Feast of the Epiphany. It is treated in a broad, lively, popular,
          genuinely naïve manner in Goethe's _Epiphanias:_ "Die heil'gen drei König' mit ihrem
          Stern" (The Three Kings of the East with their Star). The three kings, the white, the
          brown, and the black, are described as they appeared when they went about, dressed up,
          from house to house in the country; and the poem ends:</p>

        <p> "Die heil'gen drei König' sind wohlgesinnt, Sie suchen die Mutter und das Kind, Der
          Joseph fromm sitzt auch dabei, Der Ochs und Esel liegen auf Streu."[30]</p>

        <p>[30]</p>

        <p> The Three Kings of the East with reverence lowly Seek out the babe and mother holy, Good
          Joseph's there too, and close by The ox and ass on the litter lie.</p>

        <p><pb n="171"/> Heine does not view the legend in a more religious light than Goethe, but
          he settles his features into a more serious expression, speaks more concisely, draws with
          a sharper outline, obtains a totally different effect. Goethe rouses and cheers his
          readers by his broad and merry artlessness; Heine's words bore their way into men's minds
          and leave their sting there. He seems to aim at producing the same effect as that of an
          old Florentine painting:</p>

        <p> "Die heil'gen drei König' aus Morgenland, Sie frugen in jedem Städtchen: Wo geht der Weg
          nach Bethlehem, Ihr lieben Buben und Mädchen?</p>

        <p> Die Jungen und Alten, sie wussten es nicht, Die Könige zogen weiter, Sie folgten einem
          goldenen Stern, Der leuchtete lieblich und heiter.</p>

        <p> Der Stern blieb steh'n über Josephs Haus, Da sind sie hineingegangen, Das Oechslein
          brüllte, das Kindlein schrie, Die heil'gen drei Könige sangen."[31]</p>

        <p>[31]</p>

        <p> The three holy kings from the Eastern land Inquired in every city: Where is the road to
          Bethlehem, Ye boys and maidens pretty?</p>

        <p> The young and the old, they could not tell, The kings went onward discreetly; They
          followed the track of a golden star, That sparkled brightly and sweetly.</p>

        <p> The star stood still over Joseph's house And they entered the dwelling lowly, The oxen
          bellowed, the infant cried, While sang the three kings holy. (BOWRING.)</p>

        <p>There is a certain amount of waggery in this. What a concert! But also, what painting!
          The fewest words possible--not a stroke, not a touch too much, and the most telling,
          prompt effect.</p>

        <p>Let us now, in conclusion, think of one of those abstract figures which occur in all
          lyric poetry--more or less carefully wrought-out personifications of an idea such as
          peace, happiness, unhappiness--and in this domain also compare Heine <pb n="172"/> with
          Goethe. Here again it will be observed that Goethe has the fuller note, Heine the firmer
          outline.</p>

        <p>Goethe wrote these lines to peace:</p>

        <p> "Der du von dem Himmel bist, Alles Leid und Schmerzen stillest, Den, der doppelt elend
          ist, Doppelt mit Erquickung füllest, Ach, ich bin des Treibens müde! Was soll all der
          Schmerz, die Lust? Süsser Friede! Komm, ach komm in meine Brust!"[32]</p>

        <p>32:</p>

        <p> Child of heaven, that soothing calm On every pain and sorrow pourest, And a doubly
          healing balm Find'st for him whose need is sorest, Oh, I am of life aweary! What availeth
          its unrest-- Pain that findeth no release, Joy that at the best is dreary? Gentle peace,
          Come, oh come unto my breast! (Sir THEODORE MARTIN.)</p>

        <p>There is no picture here, no real personification. There is a crescendo movement through
          the first six lines, which culminates in the outburst: "Süsser Friede!"--though we could
          not feel quite certain that this outburst was coming.</p>

        <p>Now take Heine's personifications of fortune and misfortune, as contained in the
          following verses:</p>

        <p> "Das Glück ist eine leichte Dirne Und weilt nicht gern am selben Ort, Sie streicht das
          Haar dir von der Stirne Und küsst dich rasch und flattert fort.</p>

        <p> Frau Unglück hat im Gegentheile Dich liebefest an's Herz gedrückt, Sie sagt, sie habe
          keine Eile, Setzt sich zu dir an's Bett und strickt."[33]</p>

        <p>[33]</p>

        <p> Oh, Joy, she is a lichtsome hizzy, She winna bide wi' ye ava'; She strokes your broo an'
          maks ye dizzy Wi' ae fond kiss, then flits awa'.</p>

        <p> Dame Sorrow is a canty kimmer, A fond embrace ye'll hae frae her; She vows she's naewise
          thrang, the limmer, Knits by your bed an' winna stir. (W. A.)</p>

        <p><pb n="173"/> Seldom have two ideas been transformed into two living forms with so few
          strokes; and there is nothing much finer in all modern myth-creation than the last two
          lines, between which are to be read the record of profound and terrible experience.</p>

        <p>Heine, as we have seen, makes his earliest appearance in the Romantic school, and learns
          his trade from A. W. Schlegel, who imparts to him his own correct taste. In the earliest
          period of his development he is addicted to Romantic ghost stories and Romantic archaisms.
          Then, in the matter of metre, he begins to study and imitate Wilhelm Müller; in his most
          famous poem he borrows from Clemens Brentano. He soon forms his own style, the
          distinguishing feature of which is extreme condensation of thought, feeling, and imagery.
          Heine makes everything present and living, introduces even into tranquil themes a nervous,
          at times dæmonic, passion, not infrequently exaggerates until he becomes grotesque,
          occasionally exchanges the light of day for the glaring brightness of electric light--a
          kind of un-naturalness which is nevertheless to be found in nature. His most effective
          poetic quality is pregnant brevity.</p>

        <p>By reason of the blend of wit and imagination in his nature, he is inclined to produce
          his effects by contrasts, to seek for striking disharmonies and incongruities; he has a
          special fancy for the effect produced by letting a commonplace, vulgar reality
          imperceptibly make way for a poetic vision, or allowing such a vision to fade and
          evaporate and give place to all too familiar reality.</p>

        <p>His style is essentially modern--everything graphic, everything perspicuous. What is it
          that constitutes a great writer? The possession of the power to call forth mental visions
          or moods, visions by means of moods or moods by means of visions. It was especially the
          latter faculty that Heine cultivated in himself; he never fails in the matter of clear
          outline and picturesque effect.</p>

        <p>At his zenith he can no longer be compared with his teachers and contemporaries. To gauge
          the power and versatility of his style it was necessary to compare it with the greatest
          style of the age--with Goethe's. In the process <pb n="174"/> he often, as we have seen,
          comes far short, but it not so very seldom happens that he establishes his right to almost
          equal admiration. It is, however, enough for him that it is possible, and now and again
          necessary, to compare him with Goethe.</p>

        <p>A style is the expression of a personality and a weapon in the warfare of literature.
          Goethe's style, with all its greatness, is not sufficiently complex to grapple with modern
          ideas. But Heine's, that weapon which in its best days was as finely tempered as those old
          Spanish blades which could be bent like osiers, but which no armour could snap, was better
          suited than any other to cope with modern life in its hardness and ugliness, its charm,
          its restlessness, and its wealth of glaring contrasts. It also possessed in the highest
          degree the power of working upon the nerves of modern readers, who have more inclination
          for spiced dishes and heating beverages than for plain food and pure wine.</p>

        <p>There can be little doubt that nothing has been more injurious to Heine's general
          reputation than his indiscreet loquacity on sexual subjects. Whole groups of his poems are
          in ill repute on this account; those, for instance, which compose the collection
          _Verschiedene_ (Various), most of which have been unjustly condemned, although there are
          certainly some which are anything but sublime in their theme or refined in their treatment
          of it. In _Der Gott und die Bajadere_ ("The God and the Bayadere") Goethe had shown how
          even a very equivocal subject can be ennobled by sublimity of style. And even when, as in
          the Venetian epigrams, he treats of Bayaderes who are certainly not purified by love, and
          dwells upon the poet's relations with them, the antique metre in itself produces the
          effect of distance, and we are not offended by any objectionable word. These few epigrams,
          too, lie almost buried in the mass of Goethe's writings. Moreover, in reading them, we
          feel that he is the man whom nature created in order that she might learn from him what
          she is like in her entirety.</p>

        <p>With Heine, communicativeness on the subject of his relations with the other sex occupies
          too important a place, and is not always in good taste. It gains him ten readers for one
          whom it alienates, but it sometimes happens that the one thus lost was worth more than the
          ten gained.</p>

        <p>And yet this frankness is, in a manner, his strength. It need not have been so personal,
          but it is quite indispensable in one who desires to compass not only the tragic, but also
          the comic hemisphere. And in this quality, and in his many shameless personal attacks, he
          resembles the greatest comic poet of all times.</p>

        <p>Towards the end of his _Winter's Tale_, immediately after <pb n="176"/> the wanton
          passage in which he smells out the future of Germany by putting his head down the opening
          of Charlemagne's night-throne, he declares that the noblest of the Graces have tuned the
          strings of his lyre, and that this lyre is the same which was sounded in days gone by, by
          his father, "the late Aristophanes, the favourite of the Muses," He adds that in his last
          chapter he has attempted to imitate _The Birds_, "the best of father's dramas."</p>

        <p>He thus, we observe, prided himself on artistic descent from the greatest comic poet of
          ancient Greece.</p>

        <p>For a moment we are taken aback. Other German poets, such as Platen and Prutz, have
          imitated the form of the Aristophanic comedy, its trimeters, choruses, parabases, the
          whole of that irregular and yet regular form of art built up by the Greek comic school;
          but Heine never even made an attempt to master this poetical form, or any other. It is
          characteristic of him that, persevering and conscientious as he was in ensuring the
          telling precision of the single metrical or prose expression (I never saw a manuscript
          with so many corrections as that of his _Atta Troll_, in the Royal Library of Berlin), it
          was impossible for him to submit to the artistic restriction of any of the great poetic
          forms. It tallies with this, that in his longer works the plan of the whole is quite
          vague, but every single line has been gone through again and again.</p>

        <p>There is probably no exaggeration in saying that he never, in his capacity as an artist,
          set himself a task and carried it out.</p>

        <p>Once only he attempted to write a long, connected prose work, a romance or novel.
          Whether, as some maintain, the greater part of the manuscript was destroyed by a fire, or
          whether, as I for one believe, the work was never completed, the fact remains that all we
          have of it is a fragment. And even this fragment, _Der Rabbi von Bacharach,_ is, when
          carefully examined, nothing but a very much antedated transcription of Heine's own private
          experiences.</p>

        <p>Nor did he ever attempt a severely connected metrical composition. His only long poems,
          _Atta Troll_ and _Deutschland, ein Wintermärchen_ ("Germany, a Winter's Tale"), are <pb
            n="177"/> irregular, whimsical fantasies, soap-bubbles rocked upon cobweb tissue of the
          brain, only connected by a uniformity of tone and design.</p>

        <p>The idea of translating or adapting Aristophanes would never have occurred to Heine. He
          was not like Goethe, who, in spite of his enormous original productivity, condescended to
          translate and adapt for his countrymen (Diderot, Benvenuto Cellini, Voltaire). When Goethe
          made acquaintance with Aristophanes, he was enchanted with him, and it is Goethe, not
          Heine, who undertakes to transplant _The Birds_ on to German soil; but it is
          characteristic that in his hands the play undergoes a metamorphosis, is transformed from a
          political into a literary satire. In Goethe's play the two discontented politicians have
          become literary adventurers; in the owl (as proved by a letter from Jacobi to Heine) he
          satirises Klopstock, in the parrot, young Cramer. It was in the epilogue to this
          adaptation that Goethe bestowed on Aristophanes the immortal appellation, "der ungezogene
          Liebling der Grazien" (the froward favourite of the Graces), which suits Heine so
          well.</p>

        <p>Heine was too lazy ever to have studied, translated, adapted, or imitated an ancient
          classic poet, but, supposing him to have done so, he would never, like Goethe or Platen,
          have made pure literary comedies of the Aristophanic plays; it was the grand political
          satire that attracted him.</p>

        <p>It is probable that Heine is the wittiest man that ever lived, or at least the wittiest
          man of modern times. Voltaire is, undoubtedly, looked upon as a sort of personification of
          wit; but his wit is sensible and dry, not poetic and imaginative like Heine's.</p>

        <p>Platen, the proud and stiff, acted unwisely when he wrote the work in which he satirises
          Heine, _Der romantische Oedipus_, in the outward form and style of the Aristophanic
          comedy, for he had nothing in common with Aristophanes but fine versification and coarse
          language. Heine, on the contrary, had all the chief qualities of Aristophanes
          combined--wit, wanton wildness, imagination, lyric sweetness, shamelessness, and grace.
          Without grace and wit, shamelessness is undoubtedly a base and repellent quality. But <pb
            n="178"/> in this combination with noble qualities it is uncommon. The Aristophanic poet
          must not, cannot have the pride which shrinks from amusing the coarse minded, who only
          understand a man when they meet him in the mire. He dares not shrink from debasing himself
          to a certain point, in order to gain a wider field of vantage.</p>

        <p>It is useless for an author to attempt, as Platen did, to impress his readers before all
          else with the idea of his high-mindedness, and to inspire them with respect for his
          person; it is useless for him to proclaim that he intends "to crush his antagonists with
          genuine wit." It is not possible to appear at one and the same time in the character of a
          refined gentleman and an Aristophanic poet. A man is a failure in the latter rôle if he
          sets more value on the esteem of others than on the triumph of art. The compensation in
          the case of the true Aristophanic poet is, that his poetry has a compass unattainable by
          the dignified poets (a Schiller or a Hugo); it reflects the whole of human life, from its
          highest functions to its lowest.</p>

        <p>Though there are so few formal points of contact between Heine's lyric-satiric poems and
          the great fantastic comedies of Aristophanes, it is nevertheless probable that since the
          days of ancient Greece there has been no wit so nearly akin to the wit of Aristophanes as
          Heinrich Heine's.</p>

        <p>This assertion is not based upon any misconception of the extraordinary dissimilarity in
          the character of their life-work. The Aristophanic comedy with its grand and exact
          technical structure is the expression of the artistic culture of a whole nation, a
          monument that commemorates the religious festivals of which it was the outcome.
          Aristophanes built upon a foundation laid, a substructure prepared, by a whole line of
          distinguished predecessors, whose style was similar, whose talent was akin to his, and to
          whose labours he succeeded, in much the same manner as Shakespeare did to the work of his
          predecessors; hence the Aristophanic comedy as a form of art is to a much greater extent a
          collective production than Heine's stanza is. Quite apart from our knowledge of the fact
          that Eupolis and Kratinos accused Aristophanes of making inadmissible use <pb n="179"/> of
          the ideas of his predecessors, we can see for ourselves, from one of his own comedies,
          _The Knights_, that plays with titles like the Birds, the Wasps, the Frogs had already
          been produced by the comic poet Magnes; the chorus disguised as reptiles, insects, birds,
          was thus not a thing invented by Aristophanes, it was an inheritance. It is only because
          we are not acquainted with the Greek poet's predecessors that his life's work appears to
          us to be a purely individual production, the type of grand fantastic comedy, in comparison
          with whose exuberance of life almost all modern comedy seems spiritless and weak.</p>

        <p>His world is the topsy-turvy world. When, in the _Peace_, Trygaios saddles a stinking
          carrion-beetle and on it, as his Pegasus, mounts through the clouds to the dwellings of
          the Gods, or when he drags Peace up by a fathom-long rope from the deep well into which
          she has been thrown by War, these proceedings are represented as if there were nothing in
          the least unusual or impossible about them; no explanation is offered; and we are
          compelled to believe in them. When, in _The Birds_, we hear two silly fellows, who are
          posing as philosophers, disclose their crazy plans for building a city in the clouds, it
          all sounds very mad, and when we see the Birds receive these men with reverence, we do not
          conceive any higher opinion of their intelligence, we are only struck by the comicality of
          the birds being so stupid as to put their trust in them. But when we hear that the city is
          actually built, that fortune has attended the enterprise and that it has been crowned with
          success, we feel that the world set before us here is not our own everyday world, but one
          with whose laws things are compatible which are contrary to the laws of ours.</p>

        <p>This new world is purely fantastic, in so far as it is antagonistic to the laws of
          probability and of nature. It is a world in which madness triumphs, and the poet pretends
          that this is as it should be. Not till the spectator begins to wonder _where_ this
          topsy-turvy world can be, _where_ such things happen, _where_ political effrontery on such
          a gigantic scale, far from being confounded and put to shame, wins confidence and is
          rewarded--not till then is he led back <pb n="180"/> to reality, to the recognition in
          this world of his own world, his own home, Athens.</p>

        <p>Three of the Aristophanic comedies in our possession, _The Birds, The Frogs_, and
          _Peace_, do not pass, or pass only in part, on earth; they are meteoric or underground
          dramas. And it is in these only that Gods are represented, and then merely that they may
          be rated, ridiculed, or beaten. In the world of reality they do not reveal themselves; for
          it is only in the world of fancy that they are believed in.</p>

        <p>Heine, the modern poet, dares not ask his readers to follow him into the same sort of
          supernatural world; and yet he cannot dispense with the supernatural; hence that
          constantly recurring use and abuse of dreams, for which hardly any parallel is to be found
          among other modern poets. Within the frame-work, as it were, of the dream, he dares to be
          extraordinary, to be Aristophanic.</p>

        <p>As has been already remarked, he resembles Aristophanes in the depth of his shamelessness
          and in the height of his lyric flight.</p>

        <p>Allusions to difficulties of digestion and the like, play a less important part in
          Heine's writings than in those of Aristophanes, who, however, we must remember, himself
          declared that he despised this kind of comicality. According to him its only
          recommendation was that it provoked the laughter of the least cultured part of the public.
          But such things are frequently referred to by Heine too, at times in the plainest of terms
          (notably in his attack on Platen), and with him, almost as often as with Aristophanes, we
          have to be on our guard against certain noisome insects.</p>

        <p>Heine of course cannot allow himself the same freedom of speech in sexual matters as the
          old Greek did, but to make up for this, he never hesitates to make an allusion that will
          atone for any want of outspokenness. And now and then there is almost no circumlocution;
          what as a general rule is indicated by a smile or a grimace is shouted to all and sundry
          with a loud guffaw, as, for instance, at the conclusion of _Deutschland_, and in such
          poems as _Der Ungläubige_ ("The Unbeliever").</p>

        <p>And yet again, as with Aristophanes, so with Heine; <pb n="181"/> from this constant
          insistence upon that in man which reminds us of his dwelling-place during the earliest
          stages of his development, he rises to the purest, most delicate lyric utterance. He, who
          so thoroughly comprehends the material origin of all living things, in one of his poems
          derives them all from the song of the nightingale:</p>

        <p> "Im Anfang war die Nachtigall Und sang ihr Lied: Zükükt! Zukükt!"[1]</p>

        <p>[1]</p>

        <p> In the beginning was the nightingale, Who sang her song: Zükükt! Zükükt! (CARY)</p>

        <p>We cannot but be reminded of the beautiful lines in _The Birds_:</p>

        <p> "Gentlest and dearest, thou dost sing Consorting still with mine thy lay, Lov'd partner
          of my wild-wood way, Thou'rt come, thou'rt come; all hail! all hail! I see thee now, sweet
          nightingale." (CARY)</p>

        <p>Heine, like Aristophanes, makes merry at the expense of the Gods. His satire is naturally
          more cautious than the old Greek's; the modern world does not stand jesting on this
          subject as well as the ancient world did. In the works of Heine, who wrote under the
          censorship of the police and of modern society, we have no counterpart to the scene in
          _The Frogs_, where Dionysus, the god of comedy, who has shown himself both boastful and
          cowardly, gets one thrashing after another, and at last appeals to his own priest, who
          occupied a place of honour among the spectators, to help him in his extremity. And yet
          there is not very much, from playful banter to broad jocularity and the most biting
          sarcasm, that Heine does not allow himself. Hyacinth's valuation of the various religions
          (in the _Reisebilder_) is well known. He will have nothing to say to Catholicism, which,
          with its pealing of bells, its incense fumes, and its "Melancholik," is no religion for a
          citizen of Hamburg; he tests Protestantism by buying lottery tickets with the numbers
          which he finds on the hymn-board in a Lutheran church; and he disposes of Judaism in the
          well-known words: "It <pb n="182"/> is not a religion at all, but a misfortune." In the
          amusing and audacious verses entitled _Disputation_, a rabbi and a Capucin monk defend
          their respective dogmas; each, in offensive terms, boasts of the happiness conferred by
          his doctrine; the royal bride who is to decide the dispute declares herself incapable of
          doing so, as the only thing she has noted is that they both stink. In a passage in his
          book on Börne, Heine's mockery of religion becomes almost dramatic. He tells how, when he
          was living on the island of Heligoland, he was often drawn into arguments with a Prussian
          Councillor of Justice on the subject of the Trinity. During one of these discussions, the
          thinness of the flooring permitted them to hear distinctly what was being said in the room
          below, where a phlegmatic Dutchman was instructing their hostess how to distinguish
          between cod, haberdine, and stock-fish--which are in reality one and the same fish, but
          with three names, denoting three different degrees of saltness.</p>

        <p>As far as earthly potentates are concerned, Heine's comic assaults are not less
          audacious, not less fantastic than those of Aristophanes. Aristophanes showed courage in
          his attacks on Kleon and Theramenes; he occasionally chanced to defend the good cause; but
          as a rule it was the bad cause he upheld, for he made himself the spokesman of an
          indefensible conservatism, and of unjust personal animosities. Heine was less frequently
          unjust or mean, and he was never conservative. But he recalls Aristophanes to us by his
          aristocratic propensities, by the grim character of his personal attacks (those on
          Meyerbeer, for instance), and also by the form of these attacks, for example the amusing
          way in which he turns to account well-known, pathetic passages from other poets.</p>

        <p>He made witty attacks on Frederick William IV., in _Deutschland_, where Hammonia warns
          Heine himself against "the king of Thule," and in the poem _Der neue Alexander_; and he
          wrote a whole series of satirical poems on King Ludwig of Bavaria and his doings. This
          latter king, whom Heine in past days had extolled, was flattered as a Mæcenas by a whole
          band of contemporary artists and poets. In the <pb n="183"/> _Lobgesänge auf König
          Lüdewig_, Heine falls foul of all his weaknesses, his gallery of beauty in the Munich
          palace, his bad verses, his annoyance when several of the famous men of science and
          artists whom he patronised allowed themselves to be persuaded to leave Bavaria and settle
          in Prussia. On the subject of the gallery of beauty we have:</p>

        <p> "Er liebt die Kunst, und die schönsten Frau'n, Die lässt er porträtiren, Er geht in
          diesem gemalten Serail Als Kunst-Eunuch spazieren."[2]</p>

        <p>[2]</p>

        <p> In love with art, he collects fair dames In counterfeit presentment, And in this painted
          harem finds, Art-eunuch-like, contentment.</p>

        <p>When writing of the migration to Prussia of the various men of note, Heine seizes the
          opportunity to give a side-hit at his old scape-goat, Massmann:</p>

        <p> "Der Schelling und der Cornelius, Sie mögen von dannen wandern. Dem einen erlosch im
          Kopf die Vernunft, Die Phantasie dem Andern.</p>

        <p> Doch dass man aus meiner Krone stahl Die beste Perle, dass man Mir meinen
          Turnkunstmeister geraubt, Das Menschenjuwel, den Massmann,</p>

        <p> Das hat mich gebeugt, das hat mich geknickt, Das hat mir die Seele zerschmettert, Mir
          fehlt jetzt der Mann, der in seiner Kunst Den höchsten Pfahl erklettert...."[3]</p>

        <p>[3]</p>

        <p> That Schelling should go, and Cornelius too, Without a tear I can see-- The one has lost
          his reasoning power, The other all his fancy.</p>

        <p> But to steal from my crown its brightest gem, Its pearl of price, was cruel; My
          master-gymnast they've filched away, Massmann, mankind's chief jewel.</p>

        <p> This crime has bent and broken me, 'Tis soul-destroying, cynical-- I have lost the man
          who had clambered up To his art's supremest pinnacle.</p>

        <p><pb n="184"/> Of King Ludwig's essays in poetry he writes:</p>

        <p> "Herr Ludwig ist ein grosser Poet, Und singt er, so stürzt Apollo Vor ihm auf die Knie
          und bittet und fleht: Halt ein! ich werde sonst toll, o!"[4]</p>

        <p>[4]</p>

        <p> King Ludwig is a poet great; When he sings, the mighty Apollo Falls on his knees and
          begs and prays: O stop! or my death will follow!</p>

        <p>Still wittier is the parody of King Ludwig's poetical style, in the inscription above the
          resting-place of Atta Troll in the Bavarian _Walhalla_:</p>

        <p> "Atta Troll, Tendenzbär, sittlich-- Religiös; als Gatte brünstig; Durch Verfuhrtsein von
          dem Zeitgeist Waldursprünglich Sansculotte;</p>

        <p> Sehr schlecht tanzend, doch Gesinnung Tragend in der zott'gen Hochbrust Manchmal auch
          gestunken habend; Kein Talent, doch ein Charakter!"[5]</p>

        <p>[5]</p>

        <p> Atta Troll, a bear of impulse; Devotee; a loving husband; Full of sans-culottic notions,
          Thanks to the prevailing fashion. Wretched dancer; strong opinions Bearing in his shaggy
          bosom; Often stinking very badly; Talentless, a character! (BOWRING)</p>

        <p>The harshness and the strained participial construction both remind us of the style of
          the royal effusions which any visitor to Munich may study for himself below the frescoes
          on the walls of the arcades.</p>

        <p>This is merely personal satire of crowned heads; but Heine's satire, like that of
          Aristophanes, is frequently directed against existing political, social, and literary
          conditions, and it is then that he is obliged to call the dream to his aid. With its help
          he descends into the depth of the earth, or mounts to a fantastic world above the
          clouds.</p>

        <p><pb n="185"/> This, as already mentioned, happens more especially in _Deutschland_.
          Observe with what care and skill Heine prepares for the fantastic description of
          Barbarossa's subterranean dwelling-place in the Kyffhäuser. First he introduces the
          refrain of an old legendary ballad: "Sonne, du klagende Flamme!" (Sun, thou accusing
          flame!) with a sketch of the legend which tells how the sun acted as the accuser of the
          murderer of a young maiden; then he describes the good old nurse who sang this ballad and
          told many an entrancing tale--the tale of the princess disguised as a goose-herd, the tale
          of the emperor who lived deep down in the earth below the mountain; this second he relates
          at length--and presently all else is forgotten; we see Barbarossa with his mail-clad
          followers, we hear him call them to horse, to arms, to battle, to avenge the wrong which
          the murderers have done to the golden-haired Germania. Then we return to the mood of the
          nursery ballad, and to its refrain: "Sonne! du klagende Flamme!" now chanted with
          enthusiasm and rejoicing. There is an Aristophanic _verve_ in this poetic description of
          the old arsenal, the empty suits of armour, the faded flags, the sleeping soldiers, and
          then the sudden revulsion, the appeal to awakening power, the supplication that the Middle
          Ages may return again, as being infinitely preferable to the sanctimonious Prussia of the
          day, with her mixture of Gothic folly and modern falsehood. The two following cantos,
          which contain a further description of the interior of the mountain, and conversations
          with Barbarossa, take the form of an account of a dream which the poet had while
          travelling at night in the stage-coach.</p>

        <p>The anti-Prussian rhapsody in the inn at Minden is prepared for in the same manner. Heine
          wants to summon forth the Prussian eagle, and to pluck him and shoot him. If Aristophanes
          had had the same designs, he would have introduced the eagle without more ado. Heine goes
          to work in his roundabout way. In the act of falling asleep he dreams that the red
          bed-curtain tassel above his head turns into an eagle with feathers and claws, which
          threatens to tear the liver out of his breast, and which he taunts with bitter hatred.</p>

        <p><pb n="186"/> In a few single instances Heine's artistic procedure is bolder, more like
          that of the great Greek. One of these is the splendid harangue to the wolves at night in
          the Teutoburgerwald. At midnight the traveller hears them howling round his carriage,
          which has lost a wheel. He comes out and makes a speech to the savage brutes:</p>

        <p> "Mitwölfe, ich bin glücklich, heut' In eurer Mitte zu weilen, Wo so viel' edle Gemüther
          mir Mit Liebe entgegen heulen."[6]</p>

        <p>[6]</p>

        <p> Brother wolves! it gives me great pleasure to-day To tarry awhile midst your growling,
          Where so many noble spirits have met, Around me lovingly howling. (BOWRING)</p>

        <p>And the speech is a humorous imitation of those which great men are in the habit of
          making on such occasions: This is an hour which to him will be ever memorable. They lie
          who say that he has joined the dogs; the idea of becoming court-councillor to the lambs
          has never even occurred to him. From time to time he has dressed himself in a sheepskin,
          but only for the sake of the warmth; he is and always will be a wolf.</p>

        <p>In the scene between the poet and the strapping woman with the mural crown who represents
          Hamburg, we have, as Heine himself informs us, a direct imitation of the wedding of
          Peithetaerus and Basileia in _The Birds_. It is wanton and boyishly frolicsome; its
          licentiousness is really more offensive than that of similar passages in Aristophanes, who
          never appears in his own plays except in defence of himself as a poet. Heine does not go
          the same length as Aristophanes, but he is more personal.</p>

        <p>In _Atta Troll_ the parallel between the two poets is still more obvious. Here Heine's
          imagination has freer play, because the hero is not a man, but a bear. There is fine fancy
          in the passage where the bear, after his flight, is described dancing for his cubs in the
          moonlight. There is inimitable humour in his declamation against the rights of man, and in
          his boast of the more ancient rights of bears, <pb n="187"/> which recalls the charming
          parabasis in _The Birds_, in which it is established that the bird world is the oldest:
          Everything proceeds from the original egg, the egg of Night, Love first of all, and the
          birds are children of Love. Atta Troll's pride in the animal world is most amusing,
          especially so because Heine manages to insinuate into the bear's utterances sarcastic hits
          at persons whom he himself wishes to depreciate--Freiligrath, for instance, whose popular
          but foolish poem, _Löwenritt_, and infelicitous _Mohrenkönig_ had roused his mirthful
          derision:</p>

        <p> "Giebt es nicht gelehrte Hunde? Und auch Pferde, welche rechnen? . . . . . . . . . . . .
          . Schreiben Esel nicht Kritiken? Spielen Affen nicht Komödie? . . . . . . . . . . . . .
          Singen nicht die Nachtigallen? Ist der Freiligrath kein Dichter? Wer besäng' den Löwen
          besser? Als sein Landsmann, das Kamel?"[7]</p>

        <p>7:</p>

        <p> Are there not such things as learned Dogs, and horses too, who reckon? . . . . . . . .
          Write not asses criticisms? Are not apes all good comedians? . . . . . . . . Are not
          nightingales good singers? And is Freiligrath no poet? Who can sing of lions better Than
          their countryman, the camel?[*] (BOWRING)</p>

        <p>[*]In German slang "camel" is equivalent to "blockhead."</p>

        <p>A good deal of what the bear says, sounds like satire on foolish communistic democracy.
          He holds forth volubly against property--bears are born without pockets, but men have
          pockets and stuff them; and discourses eagerly on equality:</p>

        <p> "Strenge Gleichheit! Jeder Esel Sei befugt zum höchsten Staatsamt, Und der Löwe soll
          dagegen Mit dem Sack zur Mühle traben."[8]</p>

        <p>[8]</p>

        <p> Strict equality! Each donkey Be entitled to high office; On the other hand, the lion
          Carry to the mill the sack. (BOWRING)</p>

        <p><pb n="188"/> But on the whole it is harmless, stingless satire, fantastical banter alike
          of the clerical party and communists, misanthropes and revolutionists, cosmopolitans and
          patriots--for the bear speaks like them all in turn. A very wonderful passage is Atta
          Troll's sermon against atheism and its development from his deism, the passage
          beginning:</p>

        <p> "Hüte dich vor Menschendenkart, Sie verdirbt dir Leib und Seele; Unter allen Menschen
          giebt es Keinen ordentlichen Menschen."[9]</p>

        <p>[9]</p>

        <p> Guard against man's ways of thinking, They destroy both soul and body; 'Mongst all men
          there's no such thing as Any good and decent man. (BOWRING)</p>

        <p>There is a gay profundity in the warning against Feuerbach and Bauer, and there is wit,
          as brilliant as Voltaire's, but richer, and warmer, in the description of the creative
          deity:</p>

        <p> "Droben in dem Sternenzelte, Auf dem gold'nen Herrscherstuhle, Weltregierend,
          majestätisch, Sitzt ein kolossaler Eisbär" &amp;c.[10]</p>

        <p>[10]</p>

        <p> In yon starry bright pavilion, On the golden seat of power, World-directing and
          majestic, Sits a mighty polar-bear. (BOWRING)</p>

        <p>What humour there is in the description of the bear-saints who dance before his
          throne!</p>

        <p>The bear gives us something of the phraseology of all the different parties in turn, but
          it is the bigoted Teuton that he chiefly favours; it is he who is most severely satirised.
          The sleek bear-damsels remind us of a German pastor's daughters; the youngest cub turns
          somersaults exactly like Massmann, and is, like him, the product of home education, has
          never been able to learn Greek or Latin, or any language but his mother-tongue.</p>

        <p>By strange, fantastic detours Heine invariably brings his reader back to the realities of
          his native land.</p>

        <p><pb n="189"/> Aristophanic, in this respect, is the passage in which, when it rains, the
          cry is heard: "Six-and-thirty kings for an umbrella!" and again, when shelter is reached:
          "Six-and-thirty kings for a warm dressing-gown!"</p>

        <p>And absolutely Aristophanic is the suppressed passage, in which the bird Hut-Hut tells
          how Solomon and Balkis ask each other riddles in the realm of shades, riddles like:</p>

        <p> "Wer ist wohl der grösste Lump Unter allen deutschen Lumpen; Die in allen sechs und
          dreissig Deutschen Bundesstaaten leben?"[11]</p>

        <p>[11]</p>

        <p> Who, think you, is the paltriest wight Amongst the crowd of worthless fellows In all the
          different States of Germany, Which are in number six-and-thirty?</p>

        <p>Balkis, to whom the question is put, sends secret messengers to make inquiry in every
          country and state in Germany, but each time she informs Solomon of the discovery of a
          specially contemptible wretch, he answers:</p>

        <p> "Kind! es giebt noch einen grösser'n! (Child! there is a worse one still!)</p>

        <p>And it is explained to us as a peculiarity of Germany, that as often as we imagine we
          have discovered her most despicable character, one still more despicable makes his
          appearance. There is no progress so certain as the progress in general contemptibility. It
          was only yesterday that X. appeared to be the sorriest knave, to-day he is not to be named
          in comparison with N. N. Heine must have felt that he had plentiful stores of invention to
          draw upon, else he would hardly, in his final revision of the poem, have rejected this
          means of satirising his opponents, one by one, in the most amusing manner.</p>

        <p>In purely literary satire, too, Heine's methods have a distinct resemblance to those of
          Aristophanes. An example of this is the hit in _Atta Troll_ at the Swabian school of
          poets--the cat in the witch's cottage, which is a bewitched Swabian poet, who will turn
          into a man again when a pure <pb n="190"/> maiden can read Gustav Pfizer's poems on New
          Year's eve without falling asleep. Another example is the satire in the same poem on the
          following rather ridiculous lines of Freiligrath's _Der Mohrenfürst_ (The Moorish Prince)
          with their far-fetched simile:</p>

        <p> "Aus dem schimmernd weissen Zelte hervor Tritt der schlachtgerüstete fürstliche Mohr; So
          tritt aus schimmernder Wolken Thor Der Mond, der verfinsterte, dunkle, hervor."[12]</p>

        <p>[12] From the glistening white tent the royal Moor issues forth, armed for the fray; even
          as the moon, gloomy and dark, issues from the glistening gate-way of the clouds.</p>

        <p>It is a poem about a negro king, who is taken prisoner, brought to Europe, and made to
          play the drum outside a circus; while doing so he thinks of his former greatness, and
          beats his drum to pieces. The idea of the black man at the opening of the tent resembling
          the moon appearing through the clouds is undoubtedly comical.</p>

        <p>In _Atta Troll_ the red tongue hangs out of the bear's black jaws as the moon shows
          herself through white clouds. And towards the end of the poem Heine tells us how, in the
          Jardin des Plantes, he makes acquaintance with a negro caretaker, who confides to him that
          he is Freiligrath's negro king, that he has married a white Alsatian cook, whose feet
          remind him of the feet of the elephants in his native land, and whose French sounds to him
          like the negro tongue. She feeds him so well that he has developed a little round black
          stomach, which shows itself through the opening of his shirt like a black moon, appearing
          from behind white clouds.</p>

        <p>And there is something especially Aristophanic in the recklessly brutal satire upon
          Platen in the second part of the _Reisebilder_. Certain amusing artifices in their
          literary warfare are common to the Greek and the German comic poet. In _The Frogs_, in the
          contest between Æschylus and Euripides (a poet whom Aristophanes hates), Æschylus tacks a
          refrain, equivalent to "spoiled his verse," to everything that Euripides recites. In the
          _Reisebilder_ Heine revenges himself by making Hyacinth alternately tack the words _von
          vorn_ <pb n="191"/> (from the front) and _von hinten_ (from behind) to the end of Platen's
          lines, thereby maliciously perverting their meaning.</p>

        <p>The Aristophanic comedy resembles the majestic frescoes that cover the interior of some
          great dome; to compare Heine's comic writings with those of Aristophanes, is to compare
          pictures carefully painted on the easel with such frescoes. In the Greek comedies there is
          the light and space of the Sistine Chapel; in them, as in the frescoes of Michael Angelo,
          everything is large, sweeping, strong; the creation of a mind that sets recognised rules
          at defiance by the vehemence of its lyric emotion, the audacity of its fore-shortening,
          and the force of its allegory. Only that Michael Angelo's world is solemnly, wildly
          tragic, whereas the world of Aristophanes is dithyrambic, a world of caricatures set in a
          framework of Greek social conditions.</p>

        <p>Compared with Aristophanes, Heine is a private, stay-at-home citizen. Aristophanes holds
          forth to an audience of thousands in the broad daylight of the theatre; Heine communes
          with his public sitting alone in his room. But the scenes that depict themselves simply on
          the retina of his eye, are aglow with more ardent, passionate life than those which
          Aristophanes embodied on the stage. And his aims are not the purely local aims of the
          Greek poet. When he is at his best, he appeals to millions who are not of his nationality,
          appeals, indeed, to the elect among all who can read. His lyric poetry is more personal,
          more intense, more nervous than that of any Greek; his satire is dedicated to the cause of
          general ideas, which did not exist for Aristophanes. He is not less witty than his Greek
          forerunner, and he always fought for political progress and personal liberty, whereas the
          enemy of Euripides and Socrates most frequently fought for a past that was gone beyond
          recall, a past to which he himself most certainly did not belong.</p>

        <head>HEINE</head>

        <p>Heine's prose is not on the same level with his verse. In his most famous prose book, the
          _Reisebilder_, he shows himself to be a pupil of Sterne; in later works, where he has
          attained to greater independence, he is always witty and lively, but seldom properly
          qualified to treat the subjects of his choice. Whether he is writing on German philosophy
          for French readers, or on French art for Germans, he does it in equally dilettante
          fashion. Judged as journalism, his writing was always excellent, but he is too strong, too
          great a man to be classified as a journalist.</p>

        <p>Too much has been made of Heine's superficiality by the pedants among his detractors. He
          was not a hard worker, but he was by no means idle, and he possessed a fund of solid and
          varied knowledge. Still, it is only as a poet that he is great; most of his prose writings
          treat of the passing topics of the day; and his fame has been actually injured by the
          publication of his letters, which, as a rule, present him to us in an unfavourable light,
          namely entirely taken up with his own interests. Pecuniary difficulties are a tiresome
          subject, even when they happen to be the pecuniary difficulties of a genius.</p>

        <p>Heine, as every one knows, did not live to be an old man. He was carried off in the prime
          of his mental powers by a terrible disease.</p>

        <p>He had always been delicate and suffering; in his youth he was plagued by severe
          headaches, and was obliged to be so moderate in the matter of drink that his friends used
          laughingly to declare that he contented himself with _smelling_ a bottle of Rhenish wine
          which he kept in his room. His nervous system was undermined while he was still a young
            <pb n="193"/> man, but it is certain that this was to a much less extent the result of
          excesses than is generally believed, for Heine is a real _fanfaron des vices_, given to
          perpetual boasting of his own depravity. He was attacked by the disease which is so
          frequently the fate of those who have lived lives of unbroken mental productivity. An
          affection of the spine, with paralysis first of the eyelids and in course of time of
          almost the whole body, consigned him to that "mattress-grave" in Paris, where he lay for
          nearly eight years.</p>

        <p>His life, which can neither be called a great nor a happy one, falls of itself into two
          distinctly defined parts--the life in Germany till the Revolution of July, and the life in
          Paris from 1831 till his death in 1856. It was a life led without calculation, but not
          without instinctive perception of the direction in which possibilities of development for
          his talent lay; it is hardly probable that Heine would have attained to his great
          cosmopolitan fame, or even that he would have become so eminent a satiric poet, if he had
          lived in his native country all his life.</p>

        <p>His youthful years in Germany are passed under the oppression of the reaction--his
          _Reisebilder_ won popularity as an expression of the general political
          dissatisfaction--but he soon makes up his mind that it is useless to meddle with politics.
          The Revolution of July puts new life into everything; Heine goes off to Paris, settles
          there, and is kept there by the embargo placed upon his works in all the states of the
          German Confederation. The Guizot Government secretly give him the small pension which
          enables him to live in comparative comfort. His acceptance of this laid him open to
          accusations, which, though they were not altogether groundless, were in many points quite
          unjustifiable. It must be borne in mind that Heine did not understand the art of making
          money; and even if he had, it would have been of little use to him. Many thousands of
          pounds must have been made by the sale of his books, but he himself made over the most
          profitable of them all, the _Buch der Lieder_, to Campe in payment of an old debt of 50
          Louis d'ors, and was all his life long dependent on the unwilling assistance of his rich
          uncle. <pb n="194"/> If he, and if the little Parisian grisette whom he married, had had
          more idea of economy, it might have been unnecessary for him to accept Government support.
          The fact of his accepting it no doubt occasionally prevented him from criticising the
          French ministry freely in German newspapers, but it had no other bad result, and least of
          all did it induce him to write anything he did not mean.</p>

        <p>From French soil he waged uninterrupted, unremitting intellectual warfare with the
          European reaction. In this respect he may be called Byron's great successor. Only a few
          years after the sword of sarcasm, wielded in the cause of liberty, had slipped from the
          hands of the dying Byron, it was seized by Heine, who wielded it for a whole generation
          with equal skill and power. Yet for the eight last years it was a mortally wounded man who
          fought.</p>

        <p>At no time did he write truer, more incisive, more brilliant verse than when he lay
          nailed to the low, broad bed of torture in Paris. And never, so far as we know, has a
          great productive mind borne superhuman sufferings with more undaunted courage and
          endurance. The power of the soul over the body has seldom displayed itself so
          unmistakably. To bear such agonies as his in close-lipped silence would have been
          admirable; but to create, to bubble over with sparkling, whimsical jest and mockery, to
          let his spirit wander the world round in charming and profound reverie, while he himself
          lay crippled, almost lifeless, on his couch--this was great.</p>

        <p>He lay there shrunk to a skeleton, with his eyes closed, his hands almost powerless, his
          noble features painfully emaciated; the white, perfectly formed hands were nearly
          transparent; at times, when he spoke, a Mephistophelian smile passed over the suffering,
          martyr-like face. At last, as in the case of Tithonus of old, all that really remained of
          the man was his voice; but it was a voice of many notes, of many whimsies, many jests.</p>

        <p>He continued to be mentally active. It was as if the driving-wheel went on turning
          without steam, as if the lamp went on burning without oil.</p>

        <p><pb n="195"/> It is not true that he reverted to a connection with any church; but the
          suffering man clung to a kind of piety and faith in God which was a legacy from the days
          of his youth. At this faith he himself sometimes smiled. We have such a smile in the words
          with which on the last day of his life he tried to pacify an excited acquaintance: _Dieu
          me pardonnera--c'est son métier._</p>

        <p>It is a touching proof of his strength of mind and of his filial affection that during
          his whole long illness he took the greatest care that all knowledge of his sufferings
          should be kept from his old mother in Hamburg; to the last he wrote her cheerful, amusing
          letters, and he caused any passages that might have awakened her suspicions to be taken
          out of the copies of his works that were sent to her.</p>

        <p>Another pleasant impression of his spiritual condition is conveyed by the circumstance
          that he, the most wanton-tongued of men and poets on the subject of love, changed during
          his illness into the tenderest and most spiritual exponent of that passion. The last year
          of his life was, as is well known, sweetened by the admiration and devotion of the young
          and beautiful woman who, though German born, made her appearance as a French authoress
          under the pseudonym of Camille Selden.[1]</p>

        <p>[1] Meissner: _Erinnerungen an Heinrich Heine_. Camille Selden: _Les derniers jours de
          Henri Heine_, 1884.</p>

        <p>She was then about twenty-eight, blue-eyed, fair-haired, and so charming, gentle, and
          attractive, that she won Heine's heart the first time she visited him. Soon he could not
          live without her; he was miserable if a few days passed without his seeing her, though he
          was often in such pain that he was obliged to request her to delay her visit.</p>

        <p>It is in the poems and letters to her, published after Heine's death, that we find that
          fervency, depth, and fulness of passion which we feel to be wanting in the rest of his
          love poetry.</p>

        <p>He calls her his spiritually affianced bride, whose life is bound up with his by the will
          of fate. United, they would <pb n="196"/> have known what happiness is; separated, they
          are doomed to misery:</p>

        <p> "Ich weiss es jetzt. Bei Gott! du bist es, Die ich geliebt. Wie bitter ist es, Wenn im
          Momente des Erkennens Die Stunde schlägt des ew'gen Trennens! Der Willkomm ist zu gleicher
          Zeit Ein Lebewohl!"[2]</p>

        <p>[2]</p>

        <p> I know it now. By heaven! 'tis thou Whom I have loved. How bitter now, The moment we are
          joined for ever, To find the hour when we must sever! The welcome must at once give way To
          sad farewell! (BOWRING)</p>

        <p>Half laughing, half weeping, he bemoans the compulsory platonic affection of two lovers,
          to whom an embrace is an impossibility:</p>

        <p> "Worte! Worte! keine Thaten! Niemals Fleisch, geliebte Puppe, Immer Geist und keinen
          Braten, Keine Knödel in der Suppe!"[3]</p>

        <p>[3]</p>

        <p> Words, empty words, and never deeds! No roast for us, my puppet sweet, Not even
          dumplings in the soup; A feast of mind, but not of meat!</p>

        <p>When, at a rare time, she keeps him waiting, he is frantic with impatience:</p>

        <p> "Lass mich mit glüh'nden Zangen kneipen, Lass grausam schinden mein Gesicht, Lass mich
          mit Ruthen peitschen, stäupen-- Nur warten, warten lass mich nicht!"[4]</p>

        <p>[4]</p>

        <p> With red-hot irons scar my flesh, Pinch me with pincers glowing hot, Or have me heat
          with many stripes-- But oh! to wait compel me not!</p>

        <p>But the great mystic poem which celebrates the nuptials of the dead poet with the
          passion-flower that blossoms on his grave, is a poem of resignation, resignation in the
          presence of Death:</p>

        <p> "Du warst die Blume, du geliebtes Kind, An deinen Küssen musst' ich dich erkennen. So
          zärtlich keine Blumenlippen sind, So feurig keine Blumenthränen brennen.</p>

        <p><pb n="197"/> Geschlossen war mein Aug', doch angeblickt Hat meine Seel' beständig dein
          Gesichte, Du sahst mich an, beseeligt und verzückt Und geisterhaft beglänzt vom
          Mondenlichte."[5]</p>

        <p>[5] Thou wast that flower, beloved! I knew thee by thy kisses; no flower lips kiss so
          tenderly, no flower tears burn so scorchingly. My eyes were fast closed, but my soul gazed
          steadfastly upon thy face; and in the moonlight's ghostly sheen, blissful and trembling,
          thou did'st return my gaze.</p>

        <p>These images, these feelings, belong to an insubstantial world, a world like the blind
          man's, where there are kisses, but not from visible lips, and tears which fall from unseen
          eyes, a world fragrant with the perfume of flowers that cannot be touched, and illuminated
          by magic, spirit-like moonshine instead of the light of the sun. There is no
          substantiality and there is no sound:</p>

        <p> "Wir sprachen nicht, jedoch mein Herz vernahm Was du verschwiegen dachtest im Gemüthe--
          Das ausgesprochene Wort ist ohne Scham, Das Schweigen ist der Liebe keusche
          Blüthe."[6]</p>

        <p>[6] We said not a word, but my heart felt all thy unspoken thoughts--the spoken word is a
          shameless thing, silence is love's chaste blossom.</p>

        <p>They held noiseless converse, but what they talked of we are forbidden to ask:</p>

        <p> "Frag, was er strahlet, den Karfunkelstein, Frag, was sie duften, Nachtviol' und Rosen--
          Doch frage nie, wovon im Mondenschein Die Marterblume und ihr Todter kosen!"[7]</p>

        <p>[7] Ask the ruby to explain its fiery glow, ask violet and rose to analyse their perfume,
          but never seek to know of what the passion-flower and her dead lover talk so caressingly
          in the pale moonlight.</p>

        <p>Heine rises here to a level with Shelley, the sublimest of modern lyric poets. This is
          Shelley's note--the violin strain of an Ariel, clear and spirit-like and full, and
          entirely modern in its trembling, thrilling, almost morbid tenderness.</p>

        <head>LITERATURE AND PARTY</head>

        <p>Börne and many later critics have maintained that Heine was never in earnest about
          anything, and have condemned him accordingly. Setting aside slighter and unimportant
          causes, Börne's resentment was really aroused by what appeared to him to be Heine's
          determination not to espouse the cause of any party. He himself, as far as it was possible
          in those unparliamentary days, was an extreme partyman in literature.</p>

        <p>It is now a generally accepted, trite axiom, that art is its own aim and end, but then
          people were accustomed to look upon it as the handmaid of the great general aims of the
          day; and in all German literary productions of that period, important and unimportant, we
          feel exactly what it was that induced the writer to take up his pen. Even an author as
          strongly actuated by a purpose as Heine was, did not satisfy those who, like Börne, lived
          for their convictions. They applied to him the expression "talented but characterless"
          ("wohl ein Talent, aber kein Charakter"), which he ridicules so unmercifully in _Atta
          Troll_. Even in the introduction he alludes jestingly to the consolation for the great
          majority which is contained in the doctrine that respectable people are as a rule bad
          musicians, while, to make up for this, good musicians are anything but respectable
          people--and every one knows that respectability and not music is the important thing in
          this world.</p>

        <p>Elsewhere Heine maintains that it is, as a rule, a sign of a man's narrowmindedness when
          he is straightway discerned and held in high esteem by the narrow-minded majority as a man
          of character; the chief reason for such distinction being that a narrow, superficial, but
          always <pb n="199"/> consistent philosophy of life is what the multitude most easily
          understands.</p>

        <p>Stoic firmness was assuredly not one of the qualities of Heine's nature. Allowing that in
          certain given circumstances he showed want of character, we proceed to what is really the
          vital question: Ought the poet to be a party-man?</p>

        <p>At the time when Heine was jeering in _Atta Troll_ at those who in their philanthropic
          and political ardour imagined strength of character to be a sufficient substitute for
          talent, a serious literary war was being waged in Germany over the question whether the
          poet ought to be a party-man or to take up a position superior to all parties. _Atta
          Troll_, which pours such ridicule on Freiligrath's youthful poems, appeared in the autumn
          of 1841; in November of the same year Freiligrath, who till then had been best known by
          oriental poems in Victor Hugo's style, and who had a short time previously accepted a
          pension from the King of Prussia, wrote, in a poem entitled _Año Spanien_ (on Diego Leon,
          the Spanish general shot in 1841) the following lines on the poet as such:</p>

        <p> "Er beugt sein Knie dem Helden Bonaparte, Und hört mit Zürnen d'Enghien's Todesschrei:
          Der Dichter steht auf einer höhern Warte Als auf den Zinnen der Partei."[1]</p>

        <p>This sentiment was condemned by Georg Herwegh in the poem _Die Partei (an Ferdinand
          Freiligrath_), the most striking lines of which are:</p>

        <p> "Partei! Partei! wer sollte sie nicht nehmen, Die noch die Mutter aller Siege war! Wie
          mag ein Dichter solch ein Wort verfehmen, Ein Wort, das alles Herrliche gebar! Nur offen
          wie ein Mann: Für oder wider? Und die Parole: Sklave oder frei? Selbst Götter stiegen vom
          Olymp hernieder Und kämpften auf den Zinnen der Partei."[2]</p>

        <p><pb n="200"/> A year later, in his poem _Duett der Pensionirten_, Herwegh taunted
          Freiligrath with accepting a pension from the King of Prussia, whereupon Freiligrath, as
          is well known, threw up his pension, joined the ranks of the political poets, and
          developed so rapidly into a Radical and revolutionary, that at the time of the outbreak in
          1848, he was looked upon as the representative revolutionary poet in Germany. It is plain,
          then, that Freiligrath considered Herwegh to be in the right. Still this does not prove
          him to have been so.</p>

        <p>The question whether and to what extent the poet ought to be a party-man is a very
          complex one. It is so in the first instance because of the ambiguity of the word party, a
          word which Heine and Börne, Freiligrath and Herwegh employed with a different meaning at
          different times.</p>

        <p>The poet, even if he is a small-minded man, can only lose by pinning his faith to any
          narrow, political, party programme, to any social or religious theory. How is it possible
          that his ideals should exactly correspond with the limited, definite aims of any party!
          Thomas Moore was a Whig poet, Walter Scott a Tory poet, because, with all their great
          talent, they were not great minds. Byron went more to the root of things than either of
          them, or than either of the political parties--yet every one instinctively feels that it
          is absurd to say that Byron, as a poet, did not take a side in politics or religion. He
          did so even more markedly than Schiller, who also could not be said to belong to any
          political party, for one reason because there were none in the Germany of his day.</p>

        <p>There are certain branches of literature which plainly have nothing to do with party. The
          poet of love, as such, belongs to no political or religious party; though it is not
          impossible that he may belong to an art party, for as soon as there is any question of
          style in art, we at once encounter party again. But the moment he begins to treat a theme
          in which there is any trace of theory, of thought, of fundamental principle, he is obliged
          to choose his side, to rank himself among the disciples of this or that philosophy of
          life.</p>

        <p>When, however, as in Freiligrath's case, we have simply <pb n="201"/> an assertion of the
          poet's right to admire Napoleon and yet to be incensed by the death of d'Enghien, party
          does not come into question at all; for all that is meant is, that the poet has not
          dispossessed himself of his right to judge the past with equity and to see the vices as
          well as the virtues of his heroes. The question of party, strictly so called, is not a
          question of the judging of the past, but of the shaping of the future; and no man can
          proceed in two directions at the same time.</p>

        <p>Another difficulty presents itself to us in the word party. It means, generally speaking,
          part of the population of one's own country. And the poet ought to belong to his country
          and his people, not only to part of them. Looked upon in this light, party is the
          narrower, country the wider conception, and if by party an actual political party,
          corresponding more or less perfectly to its name or its programme, is meant, then as a
          matter of course country is superior to party.</p>

        <p>But if we take the word party in the sense in which we use it when we speak of Schiller
          and of Byron as party-men, then party is a wider, a grander conception than country. For
          by country we understand a definitely bounded tract of land, definitely limited interests,
          a definitely circumscribed history; but by party in this sense we understand a system of
          ideas which, from their very nature, are not confined to any place--world-wide thoughts,
          the great general interests of humanity. And even if the party sided with represents only
          the great moving ideas of one age, an age is a wider, greater native land than a country;
          and the poet does his people a service by extending their horizon beyond their country's
          bounds.</p>

        <p>Börne and Heine were, in my opinion, both strong party-men, but none the less both
          zealous patriots, their patriotism quite uninjured by their partisanship.</p>

        <p>The official press of the day proclaimed Börne to be not only a mad Radical, but a
          libeller of his country. He had the dangerous habit of expressing all his opinions in such
          violent terms that they offended, wounded, or incited to action. There was an outcry of
          indignation when he <pb n="202"/> wrote that any nation had a right to depose its king
          even if it were only because it had taken a dislike to the shape of his nose. And whole
          volumes of invective were called forth by his observations on the servility
          (_Bedientennatur_) of the Germans. He had gone so far as to call them "a nation of
          flunkeys."</p>

        <p>He himself writes: "What can I do with people who really seriously believe that I have
          advised the nations of Europe to depose their kings as soon as they take a dislike to
          their noses.... If I were to say: Gentlemen! I did not mean you to take me so literally,
          they would perhaps believe me--but that would avail me nothing. They would say: You ought
          to have remembered that you do not write for educated readers only, but that a large
          proportion of your readers are uneducated men. To this I would answer nothing but: Take me
          to prison! Then when I was brought into court I would say: Gentlemen! The German is a
          crocodile! (Cries of indignation. Crocodile! Order!) Gentlemen! The German is a crocodile!
          (Order! Judge: You are abusing your right of self-defence.) Gentlemen! The German is a
          crocodile--I beg of you to allow me to continue. When I use the word crocodile I am not
          hinting at savage instincts or crocodile tears. The German is tame and good-natured, and
          weeps tears that are as sincere as the tears of a whipped child. If I have applied the
          name of crocodile to the German, it is only on account of his skin, which does resemble
          that of the crocodile. It consists of hard scales, and is like a slated roof. Anything
          solid that falls upon it rebounds, anything liquid runs off. Suppose, now, gentlemen, that
          you wished to mesmerise such a crocodile, with the final intention of curing his weak
          nerves, but in the first instance of making him so clear sighted that he could see inside
          himself, discover his own disease, and find out the proper remedy for it. How would you
          set about it? Would you gently stroke the crocodile coat-of-mail with your warm hand? No,
          you would not be so foolish; you know that would make no impression on it. You would stamp
          on it, drive nails into it, and if that were not enough, you would fire a hundred bullets
          at it,<pb n="203"/> calculating that ninety-nine of them would take no effect, and that
          the hundredth would bring about just the mild, modest results your mesmerism was intended
          to produce. This is what I have done."[3]</p>

        <p>One sees that Börne's strong language on the subject of German servility and indolence is
          simply the negative expression of his patriotism. It is a patriotism which as a rule finds
          only indirect expression, but we feel it as distinctly in his melancholy derision as in
          the enthusiastic demonstrations of others.</p>

        <p>As regards Heine, Börne's charges were, no doubt, to a certain extent well founded. The
          versatile poet's temperament made the monotonous struggle for a political conviction hard
          for him, and he was, as we have already shown, drawn two ways and rendered vague in his
          utterances by feeling himself to be at one and the same time a popular revolutionist and
          an enthusiastic aristocrat. But his objection to connecting himself with any of the
          existing political or religious parties was more a proof of his high intellectual standard
          than of anything else. His raillery in _Atta Troll_ at the canting preachers of the
          Opposition is delightful and perfectly justifiable; it only shows that he abhorred
          dogmatism in all its forms.</p>

        <p>Börne is wrong in assuming that Heine, the man, was false to his party, taking that word
          in its greater, wider, signification, namely, the ideas for which he contended. For to
          these he was faithful, even throughout the eight long years when he lay on his deathbed,
          with difficulty opening his paralysed eyelids to look for God in that heaven whose
          emptiness he himself had so sadly and defiantly described.</p>

        <p>And Heine was as true a patriot as Börne. Every reader of his works must remember the
          beautiful passage at the conclusion of the _Reisebilder_, in which he tells how the
          Emperor Maximilian sate in sore straits in the Tyrol, encompassed by his enemies,
          forgotten by his knights and courtiers. Suddenly the door of his prison cell was opened,
          and there entered a man in disguise, whom the Emperor recognised as Kunz von der Rosen,
          his faithful court jester.</p>

        <p><pb n="204"/> I feel it to be not only beautiful but true when Heine says: "O German
          fatherland! beloved German people! I am thy Kunz von der Rosen. The man whose only
          business it was to amuse thee, to cater for thy mirth in times of prosperity, makes his
          way into thy prison in time of need. Here, under my cloak, I bring thee thy strong sceptre
          and thy beautiful crown--dost thou not recognise me, my Emperor? ... Thou liest in fetters
          now, but in the end thy rightful cause will prevail; the day of deliverance is at hand, a
          new time is beginning, my Emperor, the night is over; look out and see the ruddy
          dawn."</p>

        <p>If we beware of attaching too much importance to single expressions, to the wanton or
          arrogant outbursts scattered here and there throughout his works, we shall perceive that
          the feeling which finds classic expression in the words just quoted was very strong in
          Heine's breast. Neither his party standpoint, nor the admiration of things foreign which
          it entailed, affected a very sincere, deep love of his native land, which made exile in
          many ways a punishment to him. But he had not the kind of patriotism which he somewhere
          ascribes to the average German, the kind that narrows the heart, makes it shrink like
          leather in the cold. His was the patriotism that warms the heart and widens it until it is
          able to embrace the whole realm of civilization.[4] How could he help loving Germany! As
          he himself has said, and as we all must say each of his own country: "The truth
          is--Germany is ourselves." His whole nature and character were determined by his German
          birth and upbringing. The second half of his life being spent in an exile that was partly
          voluntary, partly compulsory--in so far a homeless man, that his works were prohibited
          throughout the German Confederation--the German language became to him a true, a grander,
          a real fatherland. He himself called the German tongue the most sacred of all possessions,
          the unsilenceable call to liberty, a new fatherland for him whom stupidity or malice has
          banished from the land of his birth.</p>

        <p>[1] He bows the knee to Bonaparte, the hero, yet d'Enghien's death-cry arouses his wrath:
          the poet observes from a higher watch-tower than the battlements of party.</p>

        <p>[2] What! not a party man! Is not strong party feeling the mother of all victory? How can
          a poet calumniate the word in which lies the germ of all the noblest deeds? Speak out like
          a man: Are you for or against us? Is your watchword slavery or freedom? The Gods
          themselves descended from Olympus and fought on the battlements of party.</p>

        <head>IMMERMANN</head>

        <p>All who are familiar with Heine's works or letters are aware of the warm friendship and
          brotherhood in arms that united him in his youth to Karl Immermann. He proposed to
          Immermann to insert some of his epigrams in the _Reisebilder_, and as a matter of fact
          there are several pages of them in the book between the divisions _Norderney_ and _Das
          Buch Le Grand_. They satirise various literary personages and events of the day. The
          attacks on those writers who imitated Oriental forms of poetry incensed Platen, and
          induced him to write his dramatic satire, _Der romantische Oedipus_, which in its turn
          called forth Heine's well-known satire.</p>

        <p>It was very curious that Platen, in his irritation, should with one blow stamp as
          Romanticists the two men who, each in his own way, did so much (more than Platen himself)
          to unswathe from the wrappings of Romanticism a new spirit, a new art--the spirit, the art
          of modern poetry.</p>

        <p>Karl Immermann (born in 1796) was three years older than Heine. He was the son of a
          correct, austere Government official in Magdeburg, and was himself a man of strong
          character and solid culture, early imbued with that old Prussian spirit of which there was
          not a trace in Heine. They were contrasts in almost everything.</p>

        <p>Immermann fought in the battle of Waterloo as a volunteer, entered Paris with the army,
          afterwards retired with the rank of an officer, and studied law at the University of
          Halle. His strong feeling of justice led him into disputes with the powerful students'
          union, Teutonia, which had usurped a kind of moral authority over all the students, and
          enforced its principles, especially that of purity of life, in a domineering, brutal
          fashion. For several years he continued to oppose the practices of the Union, and more
          than once during this time was obliged to invoke the power of the law to protect him from
          the insults and persecution to which he was subjected by his antagonists. The consequence
          of this was that he was hated by the great majority as an informer--the more so as the
          political reactionaries took advantage of this opposition to the traditional malpractices
          of the students' unions, to attack, and, where it was possible, suppress the unions, a
          proceeding for which Immermann was in no way responsible. From this time onwards he stood
          alone. Much in his character, much of its dryness and peculiarity, had its origin in this
          isolation, which also favoured the development of pride and self-esteem.</p>

        <p>[Illustration: IMMERMANN]</p>

        <p>In 1819, Immermann was given a Government appointment (that of _Divisionsauditor_), in
          the town of Münster, in Westphalia, an old, strictly Catholic, provincial town, where at
          first he felt himself out of sympathy with every one and everything. But here, ere long,
          he made acquaintance with the woman who was to be the most powerful influence in his
          life.</p>

        <p>Elisa von Lützow was the wife of Brigadier-General Adolf von Lützow, the famous leader of
          the volunteer corps celebrated in Körner's song. By birth she was a Dane, a Countess
          Ahlefeldt-Laurvig of Tranekjær in the island of Langeland. When Immermann first saw her
          she was twenty-nine, and, according to the testimony of her contemporaries, a most
          fascinating woman, graceful, charming, intelligent, of aristocratic bearing, and yet
          genial. From her earliest youth she had made a deep impression on the men who came within
          her sphere.</p>

        <p>She had grown up the supposed heiress of great wealth, but in an unhappy home; her father
          and mother had become estranged from each other, and about the time she was fourteen they
          separated. Count Ahlefeldt, a favourite of Frederick VI., was a pleasure-loving man, a
          pasha with a constantly changing harem; he was a patron of music and of the drama, kept a
          private orchestra, and entertained companies of French and German actors at Tranekjær; so
            <pb n="207"/> hospitable and recklessly extravagant was he that even his great wealth
          could not stand the drain upon it. What brought Elisa and Immermann together was her
          applying to him for legal advice when her father not only refused to make over to her what
          had been left her by her mother, who had died in 1812, but also to pay the yearly income
          which he had settled upon her.</p>

        <p>Count Ahlefeldt long refused his consent to his daughter's marriage with the poor and as
          yet undistinguished foreign officer, but he gave it in 1810, and when, in 1813, the youth
          of Prussia joyfully and enthusiastically rose to arms at the call of Frederick William
          III., and Lützow formed the famous volunteer corps known by his name, his wild and daring
          riflemen (_die wilde, verwegene Jagd_) found their Valkyrie in their leader's beautiful
          wife, who was worshipped by the whole regiment as a superior being. Elisa, who appears to
          have spoken German from her childhood, felt herself at home on German soil, became a
          faithful daughter of her new fatherland, and identified herself with its interests. She
          inspirited the brave, nursed the wounded with heroic devotion, was the confidante, helper,
          and comforter of the best among the young men. After a victory, the choicest of the booty
          was always presented to her. The lieutenant who first stepped into Napoleon's captured
          carriage after the fight at Belle-Alliance brought her, as a remembrance, a pair of gloves
          and two glasses of the Emperor's.</p>

        <p>After the conclusion of peace she lived with her husband in the different garrison towns
          to which he was transferred. In 1817 they came to Münster. The stiff, narrow-minded,
          bigoted tone of its society was antipathetic to her; but here, as elsewhere, she gathered
          round her a circle of enthusiastic admirers, who were charmed by her taste and by the keen
          intelligence which she displayed, without being a great talker--sometimes only by a smile
          and a nod.</p>

        <p>To Immermann she was like a revelation from a higher, nobler world, for which in his
          lonely, joyless life he had been longing. Lützow's quarters were in a castle-like building
          that had been a convent, with high windows and great folding doors. Here, surrounded by
          flowers, statues, <pb n="208"/> books, birds, dogs, and admirers, she seemed like a noble
          lady of olden days, or one of those princesses of the Renaissance who attracted poets to
          their courts and inspired them.</p>

        <p>With the year 1825 came a great change in Elisa's life. The good-natured and chivalrous
          but volatile and impressionable Lützow fell so violently in love with an insignificant
          flirt that he requested his wife to set him at liberty again. This she was not prepared to
          do; but after she happened to overhear Lützow remark to a friend that when he was quite
          young he had made up his mind to marry a great heiress, a new light was thrown upon the
          determination he had shown in their early days to win her, and her feelings towards him
          changed. Her pride was hurt; she presently informed him that she would no longer stand in
          the way of his happiness, and agreed to a divorce, the reason of which she kept
          secret.</p>

        <p>Not an angry word passed between husband and wife. The divorce was pronounced in April
          1825. Both before and after it Lützow wrote Elisa letters which testify to a most friendly
          feeling and warm admiration. It was an unlucky day for him when he took the step which
          separated them. He was universally blamed, and when it came to the point, his capricious
          enslaver would have nothing to say to him. He repented his delusion when it was too late.
          Some years afterwards, in order to make a home for himself again, he married his brother's
          widow, but this lady's temper was so bad that it made the last years of his life most
          unhappy.</p>

        <p>The divorce left Elisa homeless and solitary, and this led to gradually increasing
          intimacy with young Immermann, who saw in her his ideal, and was passionately desirous to
          make her his wife. But Elisa shuddered at the thought of a second marriage; the
          disillusionments of her wedded life had disgusted her with matrimony in general, and she
          reflected, moreover, that she was six years older than the young poet. When Immermann, in
          1827, was promoted to the appointment of _Landesgerichtsrath_ in Düsseldorf, he
          passionately urged her to accompany him <pb n="209"/> there. She agreed to do this, though
          she again refused to marry him; both, however, vowed never to think of marriage with any
          one else.</p>

        <p>The lovers inhabited a country house in the village of Derendorf, close to Düsseldorf,
          where they had their separate suites of apartments. This house, which lay in a great rose
          garden, they decorated with exquisite taste, and here they lived a full and happy life for
          a number of years. Düsseldorf was at that time the resort of many of the best artists in
          Germany, painters like Schadow, Lessing, Hildebrandt. Thither, too, came poets (like
          Grabbe), composers (Mendelssohn), art amateurs, and critics from all parts. Immermann's
          and Elisa von Ahlefeldt's house was a rendezvous for all these. In Elisa's circle in
          Münster, Immermann had distinguished himself as a clever reader of dramatic works; here he
          continued to give semipublic readings of the same description. This gradually developed a
          desire on his part to manage a theatre. He rehearsed a number of trial plays with the
          Düsseldorf theatrical company; artists from other parts came to his assistance; the great
          actor, Seydelmann from Berlin, played Nathan; Felix Mendelssohn put two operas on the
          stage for him and directed the performance.</p>

        <p>Elisa's father died in 1832. She did not inherit all the wealth that in her youth was
          expected to be her portion, but the cousin who succeeded to her father's title and
          property settled a handsome annuity on her. She and Immermann now travelled together--on
          the Rhine, to Dresden, in Holland; a tour which Immermann took alone is described in his
          _Reisejoumal_, which consists entirely of the letters he wrote to Elisa. Everything else
          was written beside her, and subjected to her affectionate but frequently severe
          criticism.</p>

        <p>After an existence of three years, Immermann's theatre, failing to obtain state aid, had
          to be closed. This was a great grief to him. He sought to distract himself by a tour in
          Franconian Switzerland. His _Fränkische Reise,_ the description of this tour, also
          consists of letters to Elisa. They were the last he wrote her. For during this absence <pb
            n="210"/> he met, in Magdeburg, a girl of nineteen, Marianne Niemeyer by name, who made
          a very strong impression on him. When he rejoined Elisa he once more, to her surprise,
          asked her to marry him. As before, she refused. It would seem as if he had been pretty
          certain of the answer he would receive, and only desired to salve his conscience. For
          immediately afterwards, unknown to Elisa, he began a lively correspondence with Marianne,
          proposed to her, and was accepted. Elisa heard of his engagement from others, and at once
          resolved to leave Düsseldorf. She did so in August 1839, Immermann accompanying her and
          the friend with whom she travelled as far as Cologne. Till this time, in spite of her
          forty-nine years, she had retained her beauty; now she suddenly grew old. In October 1839
          Immermann married; in August 1840 he died. Elisa survived him fifteen years.[1]</p>

        <p>It is quite obvious that the connection with Elisa, which for so many years was
          pleasurable and helpful to Immermann, in the end became burdensome to him. But it is
          unwarrantable to assert (as Goedeke has done) that it was the breaking off of this
          connection and his subsequent lawful marriage which first gave Immermann the creative
          vigour which he displayed in his last important work, _Münchhausen_. It was conceived and
          executed under Elisa's influence to quite the same extent as his other works.</p>

        <p>Her personality and the position in which he stood to her often and in many ways
          influenced his writings. She is supposed to have suggested his drama, _Petrarca_, which
          treats of Petrarch's love of Laura, and represents the irresistible strength of a passion
          inspired by a high-born lady even when the said lady is not free. Her views on the subject
          of love, and its unqualified justification as such, are said to be recognisable in the
          drama, _Cardenio und Celinde_. She was probably his model for the heroine of the comedy,
          _Du schelmische Gräfin_, and certainly the model for Johanne in the novel _Die Epigonen_.
          But all this is as nothing in comparison with the general development and refining
          influence which she exerted over him as an author.</p>

        <p><pb n="211"/> Immermann's is a curious fame. Of all his works only one is still read, his
          novel, _Münchhausen_; and only one part of this novel, the smaller half of it (now
          separated from the rest and published by itself), will carry his name down to posterity.
          This one small volume is in reality of more value than all the rest of his work.</p>

        <p>In its construction, _Münchhausen_, following the general rule of the Romantic tales, was
          intentionally disorderly; the book begins, for example, with the eleventh chapter. The
          hero, a Westphalian baron, is a descendant of the old lying Münchhausen, and, like him, a
          fantastic liar. The whole was meant to be a sort of satiric repertory of the various
          humbugs and nonsensicalities of the day, amongst which the author's humour might play at
          will. But out of all this irregular play of fancy, which corresponds to the title _Eine
          Geschichte in Arabesken_, there was gradually developed the great rural romance which has
          taken a place in German literature under the name of _Der Oberhof_. Its principal
          characters, the village magistrate (_der Hofschulze_) and the fair-haired Lisbeth,
          represent a new truth, a new creative art. They live and move on "the red soil" of
          Westphalia, and in their persons the German peasant is for the first time introduced into
          literature without the sentimentality of the pastoral idyll or the distortion of the opera
          ballet, undoubtedly conventionalised, but with caste and race individuality. There is a
          vigorous, fresh naturalness about these characters, which will never grow old.</p>

        <p>_Der Oberhof_ has taken its place as the original type of all the European peasant tales,
          and in certain points it is superior to any of them, old-fashioned in many ways as it now
          seems. Hundreds of fantastic threads connect this admirable story with the romance of
          Romanticism, but it is easy to cut them, and then we have before us as it were the hard
          crystal into which Romanticism finally condensed itself in Immermann's mind.</p>

        <p>It is the custom nowadays to regard the peasant tale as a direct offshoot of Romanticism.
          Yet it undoubtedly, both in France and in the North, marked the transition to an art
          which, was more true to nature than the Romantic.</p>

        <p><pb n="212"/> It signified a complete change of sphere in German art when Immermann gave
          up writing historical or fantastic dramas in iambic verse, the scenes of which were laid
          in countries which he had never seen, and portrayed ordinary human life in the little
          known province of Westphalia, where he had lived and exercised the functions of a judge.
          There were no railways in the Westphalia of those days, and no manufactures; but it was a
          country of patriarchal, wholesome manners and customs, and he had only to represent it
          with the faithfulness which illuminates, to produce an effect infinitely surpassing that
          of any of the earlier arbitrary creations of his poetic imagination.</p>

        <p>The wealthy peasant landowner, who is the principal personage in this story, is the
          prototype of all the sturdy, independent farmers of the German peasant tales, and of many
          in those of other countries. Excellent as many of Auerbach's characters of this type are,
          he surpasses them all in what may be called the historic greatness which is imparted to
          this character by the intimate relation which we feel to exist between it and the far back
          past of the country. This peasant appears on the background of traditions still in force,
          which link the present with almost forgotten times.</p>

        <p>He is a genuine peasant. He is not in the least amiable; he has had no time to cultivate
          amiability; from his boyhood, life has been too hard to allow of that. His distinguishing
          qualities are sound common sense, seriousness, obstinacy, pride of position, and
          permissible self-interest. There is a granite-like foundation to his character. He has the
          true peasant shrewdness, not to say shiftiness, in business; he is always ready to advise
          his neighbours how best to hold their own against the authorities when any forced sale of
          land is threatened, always on his guard against emissaries of the government, even when
          their mission is the construction of new roads or some such improvement; he is cold in his
          family relations, and has all the prejudices of the rustic.</p>

        <p>And yet he is great. He rules, and he always carries his point. He not only reigns over
          his own large estate <pb n="213"/> like the stern, patriarchal kings of old, upholding
          good old customs, keeping his eye on every one and everything, admonishing in proverbs,
          rewarding with the honour of retention in his service; but, unquestionably the superior of
          all his neighbours, he has induced them to regard him as their leader, and has quietly,
          without disturbance or revolt of any kind, led them to free themselves from the supremacy
          of state authorities and to rule themselves under him as a sort of judge of the old Jewish
          type. In his district both law-suits and criminal cases are unknown; no one goes to law
          with his neighbour; no one is ever accused of a crime; one might take it to be an oasis of
          innocence and peace. It is far from being that; but since medieval times the secret courts
          of justice (_Vehmgerichte_) have existed here, and the peasants, under the influence of
          this great peasant, have agreed to uphold these, and thus privately provide for the
          maintenance of equity and justice among themselves. They assemble secretly at night in a
          lonely place and settle their own disputes. The sentences are accepted and executed
          without dispute. The only punishment awarded is a sort of excommunication of the
          malefactor, which is as severe a chastisement as any that could be imposed by a state
          judge. A peasant whom all avoid, whom no one will help, with whom no one will have any
          dealings, suffers from almost as strict isolation as the man confined in a prison
          cell.</p>

        <p>As a symbol of his power and dignity the old "Hofschulze" treasures a sword, which he
          believes to be what tradition calls it, the sword of Charlemagne, and which he regards as
          his most precious possession. His hand is on its hilt when he pronounces judgment. This
          sword, which was dug up somewhere in the neighbourhood, is really a perfectly common
          weapon, possibly two hundred years old; and we have an admirable description of how the
          old farmer is at times tormented by doubts of its antiquity, doubts which, with his
          peasant shrewdness, he tries to dispose of once for all. He tempts an antiquarian in the
          neighbourhood with the sight of a beautiful amphora, and then obliges him to give in
          payment for it a written <pb n="214"/> certification that the sword had undoubtedly
          belonged to Charlemagne.</p>

        <p>The tragic catastrophe of the story is brought about in this way. A man who is now a
          vagrant had, in consequence of an intrigue with the daughter of the "Hofschulze," been
          attacked by her brother and had killed him in self-defence. This vagabond, to revenge
          himself on the "Hofschulze" for the sentence of excommunication which has ruined his life,
          steals the sword and hides it where no one can find it. The loss breaks the old man's
          spirit. All the mysteries of the secret court of justice are divulged, and he is obliged
          to stand his trial.</p>

        <p>Granted permission to make a last speech, he says: "Your Worship! I have no doubt that
          the clerk is noting me down in his minutes as a fool, and my sword and secret
          judgment-seat as foolery; for so, if I mistake not, I heard the young gentleman call the
          things that lie nearest to my heart. I would fain give some explanation regarding this
          foolery." And he goes on to say how, ever since he could think, he has observed that,
          after calamities such as hailstorms, floods, failure of crops, or cattle-plague, some of
          those gentlemen came to the district who not only understand how to write reports, but
          also how to judge everything much better than the people concerned; they described the
          calamity after it was past, but were never there at the time to help; and if a little
          money happened to be sent, it never reached those who needed it most. "One thing was more
          astonishing than all else. One or other of these government gentlemen would order things
          so in the district that we peasants could not refrain from laughing at it all. In a year
          or two the same gentleman would come driving in a carriage and four, with all kinds of
          ribbons and orders on his breast, looking as if he had helped to create the world.
          Thinking over all this in my plain way, I came to the conclusion that the government
          gentlemen were of little service to us peasants; nor did they come to do us service; they
          came to write, and they wrote until they wrote themselves into a carriage and four.... And
          then I thought (for all my life I have been given to thinking) that a steady, industrious
            <pb n="215"/> man will always get on if he watches the wind and the weather, and attends
          to his business and is a good neighbour.... And first I accustomed myself, even in times
          of trouble, never to think of help; I paid my taxes and bore my own burdens ... and then I
          accustomed my neighbours to do the same. They followed my example; we settled our own
          affairs among ourselves, and many matters about which much ado would have been made
          elsewhere, were never heard of beyond the bounds of the parish.... By degrees we came to
          settling everything. A peasant has understanding enough to tell who has the best claim to
          a certain wall or strip of meadow. And when a house has been broken into, the village
          nearly always knows who has been the thief; but because it is not always possible to bring
          sufficient proof, a man well known to be a rascal may impudently and scandalously show his
          face and enjoy his booty, which its rightful owner never recovers. So we quietly took the
          law into our hands, and no one could accuse us of anything, for we injured no man; we only
          refused to hold any communication whatsoever with the evildoers whom we placed under the
          ban; and of this ban men were more afraid than of the judge's sentence and prison."</p>

        <p>"And," he concludes, "if other people would but do the same, if the townsmen, the
          merchants, the noblemen, the scholars, would but manage their own affairs, things would be
          better than they are. Men would no longer be like stupid children, for ever crying for
          father and mother, but every man would be like a prince in his own house and among his
          equals. And the king himself would then be a far mightier monarch, a ruler like no other,
          for he would rule over hundreds of thousands of princes,"</p>

        <p>We have the feeling at the end of the story that, now the secret is divulged and the
          sword stolen, the days of popular justice are at an end. But the author gives us his own
          opinion on this subject by the mouth of the wise pastor, who declares that the
          independence which is the watch-word of this peasant and his friends is a reality which
          cannot be done away with by being divulged, that the idea which has united them, the idea
          that a man is <pb n="216"/> dependent on his neighbours, not on strangers who stand in a
          perfectly artificial relation to him, does not require the support of the tribunal under
          the old lime-tree. In the peasant farmer himself, the mighty old yeoman, he sees the true
          sword of Charlemagne, which no thief can steal, the true backbone of the country.</p>

        <p>Observe that this is written by an author who was a magistrate and the son of a Prussian
          government official.</p>

        <p>A marked contrast to the strong, stern figure of the old peasant, but drawn with as sure
          a hand, is Lisbeth, the fair-haired, country girl who is the heroine of the tale. Young
          Count Oswald, who wanders about the country shooting, falls in love with her, and it is
          the eventful love-story of these two young people which forms the chief attraction of the
          book. Immermann had in his writings long shown himself to be a firm believer in the
          unbounded power of love over humanity, but here he tells the story of young love as he had
          never done before. We have the beat and glow of two innocent young hearts. The youth and
          maiden meet, full of budding, swelling, healthy presentiments and hopes. No renunciation
          or disappointment has as yet cooled one drop of their warm blood. The distance between
          them is bridged over in an original manner. The young sportsman, who has inherited from
          his parents a taste for shooting, along with absolute incapacity to hit anything, for once
          in his life succeeds in setting his mark on a living creature; he lodges a whole charge of
          small shot in the girl's shoulder. The shame and regret he feels give place in time to
          ardent love. When she has recovered and the two have discovered that they love each other,
          they go together one day into the wood.</p>

        <p>"'I want to ask your wounds to forgive me,' he said--undid her kerchief, and kissed the
          small red spots between her breast and her white shoulder. She did not resist; her little
          hands lay folded on her lap, and she sat quite still, a resigned victim of love; but she
          looked at him bashfully, entreatingly. He could not bear that look; he quickly covered
          breast and shoulders again with the kerchief, fell at her feet, pressed her knees to his
          heart, <pb n="217"/> and then walked away a few steps to overcome his emotion."</p>

        <p>This suffers in translation. It must be read as it occurs in the original, this little
          field idyll, in which the lovers play like children; she stands up against him that he may
          measure her height; he plays with her curls; from time to time she gently whispers: "O
          du!" but this is all she can say; they make a meal on apples and bread, which they buy
          from a woman they meet, agreeing that novel writers lie when they assert that love lives
          on air; she eats from his hand and he from hers. It is all as natural and as good as
          anything of the same style in Auerbach, Keller, or Björnson.</p>

        <p>And Immermann's description of the sorrows of love is no less admirable. Nothing in the
          book surpasses the passage in which the old farmer tells Lisbeth that her lover is a young
          nobleman, and makes her understand that she must not expect him to marry her. Oswald has
          concealed his position and given himself out to be an ordinary forester, only with the
          intention of giving her a joyful surprise later. If she had taken time to think, she would
          have come to the conclusion that she need have no fear of his proving unfaithful. But the
          knowledge that her lover has lied is a blow that upsets her equilibrium, and Immermann
          profoundly remarks, "For love, as long as it is unshaken, is divine penetration ... but
          once shaken, once driven to conjecture and surmise, it is madness, which passes cathedrals
          without seeing them and takes molehills for mountains." This is a profound saying, because
          it is a true psychological appreciation of a feeling which is the product of unknown
          causes. Heine's psychology of love was very simple; when he complains, it is always of
          faithlessness as a wrong knowingly committed. Immermann here represents what may be called
          the somnambulistic action of the feeling, the instinct, unerring as that of the
          sleep-walker, which it possesses when undistracted by disturbing forces.</p>

        <p>Both in broad outline and in minute detail this first of the peasant novels is sterling
          poetry. The influence of fantastic Romanticism is still distinct; the secret tribunal, <pb
            n="218"/> the sword of Charlemagne, the enthusiasm for old customs are Romantic
          features; even Lisbeth's fanciful pedigree--the fathering of this truthful young being on
          the old liar Münchhausen--betrays that the tale is an outgrowth of an earlier Romantic
          literature. All this, however, only throws into stronger relief the laborious, yet
          vigorous, process of condensation by which healthy, modern realistic appreciation and
          treatment of popular subjects was evolved out of the arbitrary fantasticality which
          immediately preceded it.</p>

        <p>Immermann is one of the company of authors, including Daniel Defoe, l'Abbé Prévost, the
          Danish poet Wessel, Chamisso, and Bernardin de St. Pierre, who prove that a single volume
          is enough to carry a writer's name down to posterity, even if everything else that he has
          written be quickly forgotten. As a matter of fact, only this one work of Immermann's
          lives. He wrote mock-heroic poems, such as _Tulifäntchen_, which was much appreciated in
          its day, but is now unreadable. He wrote works which, for their day, must be pronounced
          meritorious, but which are now given over to moth and rust, such as the drama _Merlin_
          (1831), a great Romantic work in well-written verse, a sort of unsuccessful pendant to the
          Second Part of Goethe's _Faust_ and the historic tragedy which was first known as _Das
          Trauerspiel in Tirol_ ("The Tragedy in the Tyrol"), but was re-named _Andreas Hofer_. The
          second of these plays is the better of the two; it is founded on Immermann's own youthful
          recollections of the formidable resistance encountered by the French in the Tyrol, and is
          written with both the ability and the will to present a faithful and impartial picture of
          the two hostile races, so unlike in their character and in their development. This work in
          its original form, as published in 1826, criticised by Börne in his _Dramaturgische
          Blätter_, and satirised by Platen in _Der romantische Oedipus_, is interesting, especially
          as a sort of mongrel, the offspring of Kleist's genius mated with Schiller's muse; for the
          hero reminds us of Schiller's _Wilhelm Tell_, and the love affair between the Frenchman
          and the Tyrolese girl, with its tragic ending, of Kleist's _Die Hermannschlacht_. But the
          play was <pb n="219"/> too devoid of any really profound, impressive originality to live
          long, and when, in 1831, Immermann re-wrote it, suppressing everything that had given
          offence or called forth adverse criticism--the whole love-story and the incident (again
          recalling Kleist) of the sword which the angel restored to Hofer in a dream--he himself
          took away what life there was in it. Pride, if nothing else, should have made him retain
          the character which Platen had tauntingly nicknamed the
          "Depeschenmordbrandehebruchstyrolerin."</p>

        <p>It was an unlucky chance which made bitter enemies of two lovers of liberty like
          Immermann and Platen, and two rare spirits like Platen and Heine. That which gave rise to
          the whole literary feud, to the clumsy, ugly attacks on Immermann and Heine in _Der
          romantische Oedipus_, to Immermann's retort, _Der im Irrgarten der Metrik umhertaumelnde
          Cavalier_ ("The Reeling Knight in the Labyrinth of Metre"), and to Heine's crushing attack
          on Platen in the _Reisebilder_, deadly from its very stench, was such a paltry trifle,
          such an insignificant though contemptuous distich, that only an arrogant and quarrelsome
          disposition like Platen's could have made it the occasion of a war with poisoned
          weapons.</p>

        <p>Platen's letters show what dire offence he took at the two lines by Immermann in the
          _Reisebilder_, which might be construed as referring to his ghazels, and how determined he
          was to revenge himself ruthlessly. Great and serene in the region of pure art, and a manly
          champion of political liberty, he displays in his onslaught on the men who had insulted
          him, an offensively boastful degree of self-admiration and an insolence which is partly
          the arrogance of rank and partly the recklessness of wounded vanity. His letter from Rome
          of the 18th of February 1828, shows that he really knew nothing about Immermann's _Das
          Trauerspiel in Tirol_, which he had determined to attack. _Der romantische Oedipus_ was
          almost finished when he wrote to Fugger: "Be sure to tell me something about Immermann's
          _Andreas Hofer_, something of the plot and any piquant nonsense. I need it for the end of
          my Fifth Act, where I make him go quite mad." The boundless contempt with which Platen
          treats Immermann in his play can thus, in spite of his <pb n="220"/> protests, only be
          regarded as vindictiveness. As regards Heine, it is simply his Jewish birth with which
          Platen taunts him in both letters and play. In the play everything turns on this--Heine is
          the Petrarch of the Feast of Tabernacles, the pride of the synagogue. So personal is the
          satire that Nimmermann is made to say, that though he is content to be Heine's friend, he
          would not be his mistress, for his kisses reek of garlic, &amp;c. From Platen's letters it
          is easy to see that he completely underestimated the strength of the antagonists whom he
          thus challenged. He feels that he is capable of "crushing that Jew, Heine," whenever he
          chooses to do so. When his friends try to persuade him that attacks on Heine because of
          his birth carry no weight, he replies, quite unmoved: "That he is, or was, a Jew is no
          moral offence, but a comical ingredient. Intelligent readers will judge whether or not I
          have turned it to account with Aristophanic cunning." So sure, so superior does he feel
          himself, that even in December 1828, immediately before he is utterly discomfited by
          Heine's return blow, he sees in him nothing but "an impudent Jew, a miserable scribbler
          and sans-culotte." His moral indignation at the first books of the _Reisebilder_ was,
          however, so great that he calls the author and his like "veritable Satans."[2] The
          treatment he met with was not undeserved; scorn was returned for scorn, and his
          underestimation of Heine and Immermann was cruelly avenged. The scurrilous part of Heine's
          attack injured himself most by exciting the disapprobation of his own friends and
          admirers.</p>

        <p>The fact that the names Immermann and Platen came to form a constellation of hate was
          actually due to the similarity of their natures, to the feeling of solitariness which,
          combined with a self-esteem that was always on the alert, made them prone to proclaim
          their own praises and to attack others with undue bitterness and with insufficient
          understanding. These two men, each in his own way, represent the transition from
          Romanticism to modern liberalism. Platen, who followed in the footsteps of the
          Romanticists in his assiduous cultivation of foreign forms, the oriental ghazel, the
          southern <pb n="221"/> sonnet, the ancient Greek Aristophanic comedy and Pindaric ode,
          shortly before his early death wrote songs and poems (_Political Poems_, including the
          _Polish Songs_--posthumously published) which are on the highest level of spirited modern
          lyric poetry. And Immermann, who all his life had treated tragic or fantastic themes with
          Romantic extravagance or symbolism, not long before he died impregnated a piece of homely
          reality with a spirit of true poetry by which the following generation throughout the
          whole of Europe was influenced.</p>

        <head>HEGELIANISM</head>

        <p>It was the Hegelian philosophy, in combination with the Revolution of July, which drove
          thinking men to take their part in the stirring life of modern history and politics. Not
          that Hegel himself sympathised with the Revolution of July. Such a violent interference
          with what to him now represented the rational state of things, could hardly appeal to him,
          in his sixtieth year, as the great Revolution had done. In politics he had long been a
          strong Conservative.</p>

        <p>But none the less certainly did the Revolution of July change the character of the
          Hegelian philosophy. It was the historical turning point, the historical crisis that was
          needed to transfer that philosophy from the lecture-room to the arena of life. One of the
          peculiarities of the philosophy was, that it was capable of diametrically opposite
          interpretations. From this time onwards we observe it to be one of the most powerful
          instruments in the remoulding, the reconstruction of life. We saw that it was so in the
          case of Heine, who never alludes to Hegel's conversion to Prussian Conservatism except to
          apologise for it; to him Hegel is always the great philosopher of the new era, the mighty
          sovereign of the realm of thought.</p>

        <p>[Illustration: HEGEL]</p>

        <p>Until Hegel was called to Berlin he had been unsuccessful as a teacher. He had attracted
          little attention at the other universities, and in his younger days had often lectured to
          only three or four students. Now he was at the height of his fame. Unlike Schelling, who
          reached maturity so early, and became so early barren, Hegel, the man of heavier, slower
          nature, entered the most momentous stage of his career with his forty-eighth year.</p>

        <p>Great expectations were formed of him, and he fulfilled <pb n="223"/> them all. His
          insight was extraordinary; he seemed thoroughly to belong to his time, and yet to live as
          it were above it--familiar with all its ideas and judging them all with calm superiority
          and profound conviction. Hundreds upon hundreds of listeners streamed to his
          lecture-room.</p>

        <p>The young student who saw him for the first time thought him an odd-looking figure. He
          had aged early, his originally powerful figure was bent, and the impression he produced
          when he entered the lecture-room was that of old-fashioned middle-class respectability. He
          went to his desk, seated himself, became absorbed in his manuscript, turning over the
          large leaves and looking up and down them for what he wanted. His carriage was awkward and
          characterless, his expression listless, his face worn and wasted, not by passion but by
          the most arduous mental labour. But he had a fine, noble head, and when he turned his
          face, with a look of profound, dignified, yet simple earnestness towards his hearers, the
          imprint of high intellect was unmistakable.</p>

        <p>He began to speak, cleared his throat, coughed and stammered, had difficulty in finding
          his words. He had a strong Swabian accent, and a jerky, unrhythmical delivery; involved
          himself in long, intricate sentences which he seldom managed to bring to a satisfactory
          conclusion; sought long for the exact word required to express his meaning, but never
          failed to find it; and when found, it always struck his hearers as extraordinarily
          telling, whether it was a perfectly familiar or a very uncommon expression. In time this
          peculiar delivery simply served to make intelligible to the listener the extraordinary
          difficulty and intricacy of the mental process. There might be tiresome repetitions, but
          if the student let his attention wander and missed a few sentences, as likely as not he
          was punished by losing the thread of the discourse. For by means of apparently
          insignificant intermediate steps some thought had been made to betray its one-sidedness,
          its narrowness, to involve itself in contradictions, and these contradictions had to be,
          or were already, explained away.</p>

        <p>What struck one as peculiarly characteristic of his <pb n="224"/> lecturing was the
          combination of two features: the speaker's concentration in his subject, which made it
          seem as if he spoke entirely for its sake; and his keen anxiety to make himself plainly
          understood, which made it seem as if after all he spoke chiefly for the sake of the
          hearer.[1]</p>

        <p>He was a wretched orator, this professor, but a wonderful thinker and expounder. The
          technical terms he employed were bewildering--that extraordinary terminology in which "an
          sich" meant according to its constitution, and "an und für sich," the completed, absolute
          existence; but his hearers became accustomed to it, and soon began to feel as if they were
          floating above the earth in abstractions so refined and so ingeniously complementary that
          the dialectic of Plato's _Parmenides_ seemed clumsy in comparison; at times as if they
          were penetrating ever deeper into ever more concrete subjects. The speaker's voice grew
          stronger, he looked round with a free, confident glance while, with a few pregnant words,
          he characterised an intellectual movement, an age, a nation, or some specially remarkable
          individual, such as that nephew of Rameau's who, without being named, is described in the
          _Phænomenology_.</p>

        <p>The novice who heard the famous thinker propound, without any illustration, the abstract
          ideas which applied to everything--spirit and nature, matter and mind--ideas of which it
          was said that they enclosed the seen and the unseen in their mysteriously but methodically
          woven net--might at first feel tempted to run away, or at any rate not to come back
          again.</p>

        <p>But he did come back, for the laborious delivery soon fascinated him, and he began to
          feel that he was making progress. Every now and then a lightning-flash of thought
          illuminated the darkness. The pupil began to comprehend that, in his master's mind, there
          was no question of this being a system like other systems, a more profound or more
          comprehensive plan of instruction than other plans, but that the man regarded himself as
          the originator of an entirely new science, which comprehended the whole of <pb n="225"/>
          existence, explained everything, God and the world, and was the completion of everything;
          for the thoughts of all earlier thinkers were discernible in his system, as all the lower
          animal forms are traceable in the human embryo; everything that had gone before had
          prepared his way, all endeavours found their fulfilment in him; from this time forwards
          progress could only lie in the direction of more special development of the separate
          sections of the great completed plan.</p>

        <p>The pupil was henceforth under the master's magic spell. The very abstruseness of the
          terminology was now an attraction the more; difficulties acted as spurs; it seemed to him
          a point of honour, a matter of vital importance, that he should understand. And with what
          rapture he understood!--understood that the whole world of sense was only appearance; the
          great reality was thought. These separate, individual appearances were not real, not true,
          only the universal was real. I think, and by inevitable laws the progress of my thought
          leads me to the complete understanding of myself and of the world. I think my own thought,
          not regarding it as my own, but as the universal thought, as the thought of all other
          human intelligences in union with mine; I deprive them all of the individuality which
          appears to be essential but is not, and see in all these intelligences one intelligence,
          and in it the principle of existence. This first principle, which finds its highest
          expression in man, is that which permeates, which creates the world. This first principle,
          which works and creates blindly in nature, is in me conscious of itself. The absolute, the
          idea, that which is popularly known as God, is not a conscious or personal being, for
          consciousness and personality presuppose the existence of something outside the
          consciousness and personality; and yet it is not quite unconscious. Man's consciousness of
          God is God's self-consciousness. I cease to live as a single, fortuitous human being, in
          order to feel the universal life live and pulsate in me.</p>

        <p>Logic, which has been nothing but a sort of childish scholastic discipline, which
          inculcated self-evident facts by the aid of barbaric formulæ (Barbara, Celarent, Ferio,
            <pb n="226"/> Camestres, Baroco), logic, which had languished and died in ignominy long
          ago, came to life again in the doctrine of the thoughts of existence in their connection
          and their unity; for the first thought necessitated, produced the second, amalgamated with
          it into a third, which in its turn summoned up its antithesis, which was at the same time
          its complement. Thought of necessity produced thought, until the thought-serpent set its
          tooth into its own tail, thus forming one inviolable circle, from which the realms of
          nature and spirit again detached themselves, dropping as the rings dropped from Draupner,
          the ring of Odin.</p>

        <p>And all the sciences came and drank of the new metaphysic, as of a fountain of life, and
          all renewed their youth. And the system gradually rose before the disciple's eye,
          homogeneous, carefully articulated, severely symmetrical, of an internal infinity, a
          spiritual Organon, a gigantic Gothic cathedral, every little part of which repeated the
          whole, every little triad the great Trinity--thought, nature, and spirit. It rose, built
          upon the granite foundation of thought, all the buttresses and arches of the realm of
          nature supporting it as it mounted towards the spirit, soaring to heaven in the mighty
          three-storied tower of which religion formed the lowest, art the middle, and philosophy
          the highest course.</p>

        <p>But even more to the disciple than the system was the method. For the method, the
          imperative thought-process, was the key to earth and to heaven. It was by virtue of the
          method that he understood. It was by virtue of the method that he saw the history of the
          world to be a connected drama, one grand drama of liberation, in which every race had its
          part, and all the parts were interdependent.</p>

        <p>It was, after all, a truly great thought-poem, which men took for a scientific
          demonstration; a new species of poetry, more dramatic and more masterly in construction
          than that which Schelling's intellectual perception had revealed to him; a new intoxicant,
          more subtle and potent than that provided by the natural philosopher. The system has,
          indeed, collapsed, the machinery of the method, too fine and intricate, has come to pieces
          in our hands; only a few of the <pb n="227"/> great fundamental thoughts remain. But he
          who in his early youth has passed through the Hegel period in his own mental experience,
          perfectly understands the rapturous enthusiasm of the youth of that day, and the strength
          they drew from these cosmic thoughts, world-ideas.</p>

        <p>Among Hegel's pupils about the year 1830 there were already master-thinkers like Hotho,
          Gans, Marheineke, Michelet; and almost all the men of mark who appeared in the most
          diverse intellectual domains from this time until far on in the Fifties, belonged at first
          to the Hegelian school--Rosenkranz and Werder, Strauss and Fischer, Feuerbach, Marx, and
          Lassalle. Cousin came from France, Heiberg from Denmark, Vera from Naples, to fit
          themselves for propagating his doctrines in their native countries.</p>

        <p>From the professorial chair in Berlin, the Hegelian philosophy spread throughout Germany,
          throughout the earth. Seldom or never has a spiritual monarch's throne stood so secure. At
          the time of Hegel's death (by cholera) in 1831, his followers compared him to Aristotle,
          to Alexander the Great, even to Christ.</p>

        <p>On the literature of the following decade, and in especial on the so-called Young
          Germany, Hegelianism acted as an emancipating spiritual power, a power that destroyed
          faith in religious dogma and freed the individual from the burden of the Christianity of
          the State church. We have already observed that even such an essentially lyric nature as
          Heinrich Heine's took on the tinge of Hegelianism in this respect, quite independently of
          the fact that his keen understanding was trained in the school of Hegel; in the peculiar
          turn of his wit we trace the influence of the Hegelian dialectic, which makes every idea
          pass over into its opposite (unity of opposites).</p>

        <p>But it was as a sort of modern Hellenism that the Hegelian philosophy exercised the most
          powerful influence upon young minds. What may be called Hegel's Hellenic influence was
          even stronger than Goethe's.</p>

        <p>The reader doubtless remembers the passage in Heine's book on Börne in which he writes on
          Börne's Nazarenic narrowness. He tells us that he calls it "Nazarenic" to <pb n="228"/>
          avoid employing the words Jewish or Christian, words which to him convey the same meaning,
          because he does not use them to designate a faith but a disposition, a nature; and he
          places the word Nazarenic in opposition to the word Hellenic, which also to him signifies
          an innate or acquired disposition and view of things generally. In other words, all
          humanity is divided for him into Nazarenes and Hellenes, men with ascetic, image-hating
          dispositions, inclined to morbid spiritualisation, and men of cheerfully realistic
          temperament, inclined to genial self-development. And he designates himself a Hellene--a
          name which no Romanticist would ever have bestowed on himself.</p>

        <p>Hellenism in this sense emanated abundantly from Hegel. His whole intellectual bent is in
          the direction of that tendency of the time to present modern matter in antique manner,
          which we observe in Goethe when he writes his _Iphigenia_, and in Thorvaldsen when he
          represents the Princess Barjátinska in Greek dress. It was not by mere chance that Hegel
          and Thorvaldsen were born within a few months of each other in the year 1770. Nor was it a
          mere accident that Hegel best understood that side of Goethe's nature which turned towards
          Greece.</p>

        <p>Hegel had received his early training in his native country, Würtemberg, under two
          influences, that of eighteenth century enlightenment with its revolt against theology, and
          that of classic antiquity. Even as a schoolboy he was keenly interested in the study of
          the Greek language and literature; as a mere child he was devoted to the _Antigone_ of
          Sophocles, which in later life was to him the typical Greek work of art, and is constantly
          referred to in his writings. He declared the study of the ancient classics to be the real
          introduction to philosophy, and his own system as a whole he gradually moulded on the plan
          of the ancient systems. It stands in the same relation to the Aristotelian structure of
          thought in which Goethe's _Iphigenia_ stands to a play of Euripides, or Thorvaldsen's
          "Triumphal Procession of Alexander" to the frieze of the Parthenon.</p>

        <p>His primary natural disposition towards Christianity is <pb n="229"/> shown in his
          studies and researches as a youthful theologian, the substance of which, taken from the
          original manuscripts, has been given to the public by Haym. In these early writings he
          maintains that the Greco-Roman religion was a religion for free men, that a free
          community, a free state, was the highest ideal of the Greek, an ideal to which he
          consecrated his labour and his life. The God of Christianity was only a substitute for
          lost republican liberty. Men had lost power; they could no longer will, but only wish and
          pray. And the more slavish they grew, the more was a God outside of themselves and above
          themselves a necessity to them. And it is Hegel's opinion that for us, in our days, has
          been reserved the task of demanding the return of those treasures--the property of
          man--that were flung up into heaven. In this he anticipates Heine and Feuerbach.[2]</p>

        <p>In his youth Hegel always sees Jewish antiquity through classic spectacles. He calls
          their ancient history "a condition of unmitigated ugliness." The great tragedy of the
          Jewish nation is, he says, a very different thing from a Greek tragedy; it neither awakens
          pity nor terror; for these feelings are only called forth by the fate following on the
          inevitable errors of a noble nature. He sees the history and fate of the Jews against a
          background of Sophoclean conception of life and Aristotelian theories. Such ideas as law
          and punishment are repugnant to him. The Christian doctrine of the forgiveness of sin he
          can only accept by converting it into the idea of fate reconciled by love. In other words,
          he can only admire the sufferings of Christ when he looks upon them as he looks upon the
          sufferings <pb n="230"/> of Oedipus in Colonos, namely, as a fate overtaking the innocent,
          not as a sacrifice offered for the sins of others.</p>

        <p>All that he rescues for himself from the shipwreck of positive religion is the person and
          life-story of Jesus--that beautiful divine-human personal life which is to him an
          equivalent for the citizen-life of the ancient world. But his Jesus is not Jesus pure and
          simple, but a Jesus-Apollo such as Heine describes in his poem _Frieden_--the giant, who
          bears the red, flaming sun in his breast for a heart. We have a similar fusion of
          heathenism and Christianity in the well-known preface to _Romancero_, where Heine talks of
          his last genuflection "before the ever blessed goddess of beauty, our dear lady of Milo."
          For this is not Venus pure and simple, but Venus-Madonna.</p>

        <p>Thus Hegel himself is the originator of that pagan Hellenism, of which it was the fashion
          to accuse Young Germany.</p>

        <p>And in his philosophy we can even detect the spirit which might evolve such a watchword
          as "the emancipation of the flesh." This was a French expression introduced by Heine into
          German literature, which was eagerly taken up by his admirers and imitators, and was
          specially execrated by the enemies and denouncers of the new literature. It certainly
          might be suspected of an immoral meaning in Heine's mouth and of an ugly meaning in
          Heinrich Laube's; but amongst the best of the men of the young generation it meant nothing
          but what Goethe and Hegel, too, had in reality desired. Karl Gutzkow has insisted, and
          with reason, that only a low mind coupled with this expression ideas of licence for all
          bad passions. For the word flesh in itself conveyed no objectionable meaning. The New
          Testament says: "The Word was made flesh." Flesh, in the Christian acceptation of the
          word, means the natural, the unbaptised, the original man. Its emancipation in reality
          meant to the young enthusiasts of the day nothing more than the restoring of her rights to
          nature, war against what is contrary to nature. What they desired was to make the laws of
          nature the rule of conduct, to release nature from interdict and ban.[3]</p>

        <p><pb n="231"/> A neo-Hellenism realised in the Hegelian spirit was what was present to
          their minds.</p>

        <p>It did not seem a matter of great consequence to them that Hegel should end his days as a
          rigid Prussian Conservative, or that his _Philosophy of Right_ should recognise all
          existing institutions as "holy things," and make out the highest ethical conceptions to be
          "idols." He had underestimated the strength of the scientific doubt of the day.</p>

        <p>How many institutions still presented themselves as objects of veneration and faith to
          the normal mind of the period? Four at most--the monarchy, the church, marriage, and
          property. As regards these, Hegel's doctrine is as follows:</p>

        <p>He does not uphold the monarchy as a guarantee for continuity in the execution of great
          political plans; no, the monarch is to him simply the logically necessary pinnacle of the
          state-building, something like the dot over the i--a most inconsistent position of
          Hegel's; to him in all other instances the subjective (the personal) is only a transient
          form of energy, so that logically the monarch ought to be in time merged in the
          sovereignty of the State. His defence of monarchy is thus a concession to existing
          circumstances. Was it any wonder that the following generation drew its own logical
          conclusion?</p>

        <p>With regard to the Church, Hegel took up the position which was subsequently publicly
          taken up by his disciple Cousin as French Minister of State. He allowed his followers, the
          so-called Hegelians of the Left, men like Göschen, to demonstrate the harmony of his
          philosophy with the Bible and with ecclesiastical Christianity, actually in his review
          bestowing excessive praise on Göschen's aphorisms. The man who in his youthful letters to
          Schelling had attacked the philosophy of Kant because it could be made to lend itself to
          the service of orthodoxy, the man who had adjured Hölderlin never to make peace with
          dogma, now in his own religious philosophy took the ambiguous course of making out every
          dogma to be the symbol of a thought, and allowing the dogma to stand, with the explanation
          that it figuratively expressed the same truth as science. Was it any wonder that his
          pupils drew their own inferences?</p>

        <p><pb n="232"/> Marriage, Hegel regarded as an incident in family life, justified to much
          the same extent as family property. How it was brought about was of comparatively small
          importance; arrangement by the parents was probably the most moral way. In his aversion
          from the arbitrary action of the individual, he dwelt on the irrationality of the private
          individual's capricious fancy for this or that girl ("dass er sich gerade auf dieses
          Mädchen capricionire"). He spoke on this subject half like an old Spartan, half like a
          narrow old bourgeois, and the youth of the day, being neither Spartan nor narrow, did not
          accept his doctrine.</p>

        <p>Property Hegel considered morally justified only as the common property of the family.
          Only when it is not the possession of an individual is what he calls the egotism of greed
          overcome. Of course he vehemently condemns Communism. But an impetus had been given to
          logical conclusion-drawing, and the time came when Hegelians like Marx and Engels drew
          revolutionary conclusions from the philosophy of the apparently Conservative master.</p>

        <p>YOUNG GERMANY AND MENZEL</p>

        <p>When, from the all-embracing thought of Hegel, the noble art of Platen, the polished wit
          of Börne, the lyric and satiric genius of Heine, the classic fulness of Immermann's
          _Oberhof_, we pass on to the men to whom the name Young Germany was more particularly
          applied, we feel the change to be in the artistic sense a fall--a fall from the confidence
          and perfect skill of masters to the immaturity and makeshifts of beginners. And among the
          men of Young Germany there were those who were destined for ever to remain beginners. More
          especially is the transition from Heine to his successors felt like a fall from graceful,
          god-like audacity to clumsy youthful defiance of all established custom, all conventional
          morality.</p>

        <p>And yet the best of these men in their best moments displayed a self-devotion unknown to
          Heine.</p>

        <p>The Young Germany of accepted tradition includes neither Heine, Börne, and their
          contemporaries (who were regarded as its fathers), nor the circle of young scientific men
          who expressed their views in Ruge's and Echtermeyer's _Hallische Jahrbücher_, nor the
          group of political poets who in the Forties gave literary expression to the feelings which
          found practical expression in the deeds of 1848.</p>

        <p>The name in its traditional acceptation has a much narrower signification than that given
          to it in the present volume.</p>

        <p>Its originator was a very earnest, but not specially gifted North German author, Ludolf
          Wienbarg, born at Altona in 1803. In 1834, under the warlike title of _An Æsthetic
          Campaign_ (a title invented by Campe, the publisher), Wienbarg published a series of
          lectures which he had delivered in Kiel, and for which he had been deprived of his right
          to <pb n="234"/> lecture, though their inoffensive matter and their unctuous manner were
          little calculated to produce excitement of any kind. To this book, which it is a hard task
          to wade through nowadays, is prefixed the dedication: "To the young Germany, not the old,
          I dedicate this book" (Dem jungen Deutschland, nicht dem alten, widme ich dieses Buch).
          This is all that men remember to-day of Wienbarg's lectures. By young Germany he meant all
          the young German minds that had broken with tradition in art, church, state, and society,
          and were devoting their literary talents to the furtherance of the reforms which they felt
          to be imperative.</p>

        <p>The programme he proposes for the new literature is alarming in its vagueness. Its
          conception of life is to be founded on a harmonious union of sensuality and spirituality.
          He proclaims a new Hellenism, in which the sensual will be more permeated by spirit than
          in the case of the Greeks, and the spiritual more permeated by the sensual than in the
          case of the Christians. But before literature can be born again, life itself must be. Not
          till the life around them has become healthy and harmonious, can the young generation
          produce a true work of art.</p>

        <p>There was, as we see, nothing new in these declamations and prophecies. Heine had already
          said the same thing in a hundred ways, comic or poetic; even Menzel in his first period
          had said the same with all the eloquence of the unsuccessful poet and violent partisan.
          Here it was expressed in the flowery language and with the rhetoric which seldom fails to
          produce its effect on immature minds.</p>

        <p>The only novelty lay in the fact that now for the first time the exponent of these ideas
          was a representative of that young generation who regarded Heine as the great author of
          the age, and that now for the first time expression was given to the theory that prose was
          the literary form of the new age, and of more value than poetry. Wienbarg's æsthetic
          theories resolve themselves into glorification of Heine, whom he proclaims to be the
          great, the greatest prose author. Not till now, he declares, under the influence of French
          prose, has German prose really been formed. Schiller's style he calls the language of the
          parade, and <pb n="235"/> Goethe's the language of the court. All the earlier great
          authors, even Jean Paul, lived, according to him, within a magic circle, far removed from
          the stir of the world. What distinguishes the prose of a Heine, a Börne, a Menzel, a
          Laube, from that of the earlier writers is, in his opinion, the want of tranquillity, of
          placidity (Behaglichkeit), but it is this want that gives it its superiority, the
          superiority of life. Heine especially is praised for having disdained "the passing fame"
          of a lyric poet in order to play upon the colossal, cosmic instrument which lies under the
          hands of a master of German prose.</p>

        <p>First Mundt and then Laube, neither of whom was capable of writing a respectable verse,
          joined eagerly in this glorification of prose at the expense of poetry, the more willingly
          as by so doing they entered a protest against the Swabian school of poetry, the tardy
          offspring of Uhland's branch of Romanticism. Mundt positively elevated this cult of prose
          to the rank of the newest gospel. How little real ability Wienbarg possessed is clearly
          shown by his second work, _Zur neuesten Litteratur_, a collection of weak essays, in which
          the only thing we find to admire is his courageous fidelity to Heine at a time when
          envious rivals and moral doctrinaires had turned the tide of popular opinion against
          him.</p>

        <p>Wienbarg had called the name Young Germany into existence, but as yet it designated no
          exactly specified group of authors. Strangely enough it was first applied to definite
          individuals in connection with a public denunciation and harsh legal proceedings.</p>

        <p>The facts were as follows: A number of young authors had gradually brought themselves
          into notice, who were not exactly in league with each other, but whose common watchword
          was, spiritual emancipation. They all held aloof from Christianity and dreamed of a new,
          pantheistic religion for the new era. Many of them desired, under the name of "the
          emancipation of the flesh" or "rehabilitation of the flesh," the abolishment of the
          traditional code of morals, and more freedom in the conditions regulating the union and
          separation of the two sexes. Both the expression of this <pb n="236"/> desire and the
          desire itself were, in the case of a man like Laube, unpleasantly epicurean, in the case
          of a man like Gutzkow, unnecessarily defiant and curiously morbid; with others again, such
          as Mundt, it took the form of championship of what he vaguely called the emancipation of
          woman, by which he merely meant more independence in home life and in marriage. By all
          these authors certain distinguished women were held in high honour--in France, George
          Sand, by whom they were strongly influenced; in Germany, Rahel, Bettina, Charlotte
          Stieglitz.</p>

        <p>They all talked much and loudly of the rights of youth, had all imbibed a certain faith
          in liberty from Hegel, and all owed their general political tendency to the Revolution of
          July. Their aim was to identify literature with life, as Hegel had reconciled idea with
          reality. They had no really profound sympathy with each other, and they soon went each his
          own way. They were widely enough separated as regarded their places of residence. Heine
          lived in Paris, Weinbarg at Kiel--entirely isolated; Gutzkow resided in South Germany,
          Mundt was in Berlin, Laube in Leipzig; and the distances separating these places were very
          considerable then. Laube was very soon in many ways an opponent of Gutzkow, and a cold,
          unpleasant critic of Mundt and Kühne. Mundt attacked Gutzkow. An accidental meeting
          between Laube and Gutzkow in the north of Italy in 1833 contributed to their estrangement
          rather than their reconcilement. There was no other community between these writers than
          that usually existing between men of the same age and calling; they were much less a
          political party than a literary coterie; nevertheless literature was not to them its own
          aim and end; they desired to devote themselves to the service of the spirit of the
          age.[1]</p>

        <p>This was the reason why they did not occupy themselves with the pure forms of literary
          art, neither with epic nor with lyric poetry, and but sparingly with dramatic. They all
          idolised the "Zeitgeist" (spirit of the times), and did homage to it in journalism and
          fiction, in critical and argumentative <pb n="237"/> essays, in fanciful descriptions of
          travel, after the pattern of Heine's and Prince Pückler-Muskau's, and at times in
          long-winded novels.</p>

        <p>[Illustration: KARL GUTZKOW]</p>

        <p>The most able of them all was undoubtedly Karl Gutzkow, born in Berlin in 1811, a man of
          a tireless, energetic, inquiring spirit, absorbed in the thousand problems of modern life,
          a cross between an analytical critic and a poet, but a man to whom nothing came of itself
          and who achieved nothing with ease. His personality had no charm, his youth no freshness,
          his prose no rhythm. But he was bold, inventive, intelligent, and enterprising. He had the
          gift of pathos, but not the lyric gift; his style was effective, but unmelodious. His mind
          was specially open to ideas, to all the thoughts and spiritual movements that were abroad
          at that day. By nature he belonged to the ungainly, but his literary enthusiasm was so
          genuine, his ambition so great, and his will so strong, that he gradually became an
          intellectual centre and diffused his influence in many directions. There was a time, about
          the year 1840, when a great part of what was best in German literature took its tone from
          him and his adherents.</p>

        <p>We saw how it was the Revolution of July that awakened in him a desire to write. The
          following year, the great year of dismissals, imprisonments, and banishments in Prussia,
          put the pen into his hand. It was a time when every word underwent the strictest
          censorship; even the advertisements in the _Intelligenzblatt_ were carefully examined, in
          case they might contain some hidden political meaning.</p>

        <p>Gutzkow began by publishing a newspaper, _Forum der Journallitteratur_. He had been
          brought up on the Hegelian idea of the progress of the world towards ever greater liberty.
          As Gottschall has expressed it: "There swam before his eyes a constant succession of
          political sunrises and world-liberating theories." His newspaper reached a circulation of
          seventy copies, and was then given up.</p>

        <p>Wolfgang Menzel, at that time the acknowledged master of German criticism, had repeatedly
          invited Gutzkow to come to Stuttgart and assist him in the editorship of his
          _Litteraturblatt_, as he himself, having been elected a member of the <pb n="238"/>
          Würtemberg Parliament, was no longer able to conduct it alone.</p>

        <p>In spite of his hatred of Goethe, nay, partly because of it, Menzel, at this period of
          his career, was revered by the youth of Germany much as Katkóf and Ploug in their first
          periods were revered in Russia and Denmark. He, above all others, was to them the man of
          the day, the friend of liberty. One of Gutzkow's aims in his newspaper had been to defend
          Menzel, the man after his own heart, against the attacks of his enemies--and Menzel had
          many enemies, for as a reviewer he was disputatious, quarrelsome, and abusive. But he was,
          or seemed to be, a man of sincere convictions. He urged the necessity for a profounder
          conception of patriotism and of religion than was then in vogue, but at the same time he
          was an ardent Liberal in politics, and as such an admirer of Börne and Heine, who looked
          upon him as a trusty companion in arms; in Parliament he championed all progressive
          measures, amongst others the emancipation of the Jews.</p>

        <p>Gutzkow, not yet much over twenty, short, slight, fair, and pale-faced, entered the
          presence of his lord and master, who was thirteen years older than himself, with a bashful
          reverence which he has compared to that of the student who appears before
          Mephistopheles-Faust in the first part of Goethe's drama. He saw a man with broad
          shoulders, a well developed chest, and dark hair, whose clean-shaven face reminded him of
          a Romish priest's. Round the mouth, with its ugly yellow teeth, a satiric smile played;
          the expression of the short-sighted eyes behind the spectacles was half defiant, half
          dignified. The man's temper seemed to be violent, his will inflexible. An expression of
          faun-like sensuality would come over his features when he talked of some erotic book, and
          yet Goethe's worldliness was as hateful to him as his indifference to politics, and he
          uncritically bowed the knee to men and phenomena that to his mind represented the
          mysterious. His character was a genuine priestly blend of irony and mysticism. He loved
          Voltaire, and enthusiastically admired Görres.</p>

        <p>Master and pupil agreed well at first, both in their social <pb n="239"/> and in their
          business relations. Gutzkow, who lived now in one, now in another of the towns in the
          neighbourhood of Stuttgart, indefatigably reviewed the great parcels of books sent him by
          Menzel. He soon caught the brisk, sweeping journalistic style, and all went well. The
          youthful works which he himself published, naturally found a more than lenient critic in
          Menzel. Yet they were poor enough. _Briefe eines Narren an eine Närrin_ ("Letters from a
          Male to a Female Fool") are humorous effusions without originality, in a style which is
          partly an imitation of Jean Paul, partly of Heine; and _Maha Guru, the History of a God_,
          the description of the psychological condition of a Tibetan who is made Dalai-Lama and
          consequently worshipped as a divinity, is a piece of fantastic writing, now totally
          unreadable. Yet Menzel, when reviewing this latter book, chose from amongst the vignettes
          which alternately figured on the title-page of his review, a laurel wreath, and had
          Gutzkow's name twice printed within its circle.</p>

        <p>Gutzkow's intention in _Maha Guru_ was to show how the god who is supposed to be
          incarnated in the Dalai-Lama is subordinated to the man in him, the false divinity being
          completely thrown into the shade by the true nobility, true divinity of the human being.
          But besides this, the book was intended to be a philosophical-satirical romance in the old
          style, representing home institutions in foreign guise. The Tibetan theocracy was intended
          to suggest the European hierarchy, the Tibetan polyandry the European emancipation of
          woman. The foreign scenery, which Gutzkow had never seen, the foreign customs, which were
          not described for their own sake, could not interest. The book was suggested to him by the
          story of the French atheist, Billaud-Varennes, who escaped the guillotine during the Reign
          of Terror, took refuge in America, and was there worshipped by the Indians as a god. His
          skill in catching, training, and stuffing birds made such an impression on them that they
          looked upon him as a second creator. But all this had little to do with Tibet, and the
          would-be gravity of Gutzkow's theme.</p>

        <p>Up to this time Young Germany and its fathers had not <pb n="240"/> seemed to Menzel to
          be sacrilegious scoffers or bad patriots. Gutzkow's irreligion so far had not disturbed
          the good relations between him and his master. Menzel himself praised Börne's _Letters
          from Paris_, which were attacked on all sides, as manly utterances, and excused their
          strong expressions as outbursts of feeling which must not be too roughly dealt with; he
          compared them to the glow-worms which shine so beautifully on mild summer nights, but
          which turn into poor little grey insects when seized by rough hands.</p>

        <p>But it was inevitable that the tie between Gutzkow and Menzel should soon be loosed. From
          the first Gutzkow had received warnings not to involve himself too deeply with the
          Stuttgart author. Hegel himself, who took an interest in the young man, had said to him:
          "How can any one bind himself to a man like that?" The first disagreement between them was
          on the subject of Menzel's attitude to the South German lyric poets, the so-called Swabian
          school, followers of Uhland, a poet who not only enjoyed the fame which he most
          undoubtedly deserved, but a far greater. As a good Swabian, Menzel esteemed and supported
          these men--Gustav Schwab, Gustav Pfizer, Karl Mayer, &amp;c.--as bulwarks of conventional
          piety and morality. But Gutzkow, with his keen sense of what was the life-idea of the
          time, Gutzkow, to whom literature was the church militant, had the greatest objection to
          such Sunday afternoon, gilt-edged poets, men who put into rhyme old, dead ballad themes,
          or their own petty, sentimental feelings, whilst they were cautiously watching over their
          interests as government servants aspiring to professorships or consistory
          counsellorships.</p>

        <p>When _Goethe's Conversations with Eckermann_ appeared, it became known how severely
          Goethe had judged his admirer Uhland's poetry. He would hear of nothing but the ballads,
          considering all the rest unworthy of notice. And a most contemptuously disparaging verdict
          upon the whole Swabian school, from Uhland to Pfizer, was presently published in _Goethe's
          Correspondence with Zelter_: he (Goethe) had never expected anything fresh or capable from
          that quarter; the <pb n="241"/> fellows concealed their want of genius under the
          moral-religious-poetical beggar's cloak.[2]</p>

        <p>After this Gutzkow took courage and proclaimed that to him also this antiquated pastoral
          and cloistral Romanticism was an abomination. In an essay entitled _Goethe, Uhland, und
          Prometheus_ he made a violent attack on those poets who sought and "found their creed in
          their certificates of baptism, their morals in conventionality, their principles in
          established custom, and their poetry in the poetry of other people." What have you to
          offer us? he cried. Evening walks in the setting sun. Where is your effort to keep pace
          with the times?</p>

        <p>Meanwhile the reaction against the Revolution of July was in full progress everywhere.
          The policy of Prussia, as well as that of Austria, was controlled by Metternich; and when
          the youth of Germany began to understand on what side the power and the energy were, and
          probably would be for long to come, they went over to that side. Gutzkow says, that out of
          every hundred students at the University of Berlin at that time, ninety-seven were strong
          Conservatives; and every meeting with an old school or college companion, more especially
          if he happened to be a civil servant or an officer, left a most painful impression on his
          mind.</p>

        <p>In such circumstances it often happens that high-spirited, able young men lose their
          heads and commit rash actions for which they are blamed all their lives.</p>

        <p>Schleiermacher was dead, laid to rest with great ceremonial, mourned as a father of the
          Protestant Church, one of the saints of theology. It had long ago been said, and well
          said, of him, that his character answered to his name (Schleiermacher = veilmaker). By
          dint of ambiguities and uncertain utterances he had kept himself popular to the end of his
          days. No one had brought up against him that <pb n="242"/> Romantic sin of his youth, the
          _Vertrauliche Briefe um Lucinde_ ("Confidential Letters on the Subject of Lucinde.")</p>

        <p>But now Gutzkow, who erroneously concluded that this forgotten book would be omitted from
          the edition of Schleiermacher's works then in preparation, could not resist the temptation
          to republish it, and to defend himself and his friends against the perpetual accusations
          of godless immorality by showing that their erotic views, and even their doctrine of the
          rehabilitation of the flesh, had been held by that man of God who was the revered lord and
          master of the theologians.</p>

        <p>This might have been a good tactical move if the youth, for he was still only
          twenty-three, had not written a foolish, boyish preface to the book. In it he addresses
          himself to the "watchmen of Zion," scoffs at their sanctimoniousness and spiritual
          coquetry, and thus adjures them:--"For one moment cast your priestly robes from you,
          forget that a man whom you still perpetually crucify was God, and listen to what happened
          once on a time elsewhere, in the world of liberty, youth, and fancy!"</p>

        <p>What had happened was the publication of Schlegel's _Lucinde_, that lewd skeleton, which
          in Gutzkow's eyes is glorious and classic, and of Schleiermacher's letters about it, which
          in Gutzkow's estimation are divine. The Letters speak for themselves. They absurdly
          over-estimate _Lucinde_, but the genuine human feeling in them is beautiful and
          courageous. In Gutzkow's preface everything is emphasised in a disagreeably defiant
          manner. He avers that love is of the nature of genius, maintains that priestly action
          neither adds to nor takes from the sacredness of marriage, tauntingly declaims against the
          cold prose of the ordinary marriage, "the water-soup weddings, the sordid procreation of
          children and struggle for mouldy bread." He winds up flippantly with: "Now tell me truly,
          Rosalie! Is it not since you have worn spurs on your little silk boots, since I have
          taught you how to throw your cloak over your shoulder, since I have invented a new sort of
          inexpressibles for you, so that every one takes you to be my youngest, dearly loved
          brother, is it not since then that you know what I meant by: I love you?" And not content
            <pb n="243"/> with this female wearer of breeches, who is the realisation of his idea of
          the emancipation of woman, Gutzkow last of all plays out an atheistic trump; "Where is
          Franz?--Come here, dear boy. I know they baptized you secretly. Who is God? What! you
          don't know, you innocent atheist, you philosophic child! Oh, if the world too had only not
          known about God, how much happier it would have been!"</p>

        <p>No specially acute critical faculty is needed to detect the unreality in this student's
          braggadocio. The original of the Rosalie who was to follow Gutzkow about in page's dress
          was more probably the Kaled of Byron's _Lara_ than any Heidelberg or Berlin seamstress. It
          is easy to imagine what effect such a preface to such a book would produce on the general
          public and on orthodox journalism.</p>

        <p>Only a drop was needed to fill the cup of public indignation, and that drop Gutzkow did
          not fail to add. In 1835 he wrote _Wally, die Zweiflerin_ ("The Sceptic"), which is an
          exceedingly weak story, with a positively burlesque crucial episode, but which
          nevertheless influenced the course of events more powerfully than any other German
          literary work of the day.</p>

        <p>Strauss's _Life of Jesus_ had lately come out, and its resolution of the historical
          element in that life into myths, bold and fanciful to the verge of folly as the hypothesis
          was, had violently perturbed the thinking minds of Germany. Indignation was universal. A
          thousand-voiced cry of condemnation rose from the Eider to Switzerland. For many a year,
          in the public mind, there was a dark stain on the name of David Strauss.</p>

        <p>The book was talked about everywhere, and Gutzkow one evening began to discuss its
          problem with a young girl to whom he was attached. "Don't let us talk about that," she
          said, "the very thought drives me mad!" These words made a strong impression on him.</p>

        <p>Strauss's book itself had not satisfied him. Rationalist as he was, he felt the need for
          a historic Jesus, and betook himself to the study of Reimarus's old _Wolfenbüttel
          Fragments_, to which Lessing before him had devoted so much attention. <pb n="244"/> He
          determined to publish a selection from these, but it was in vain that he applied with this
          intention to the most courageous of the German publishers, Campe. In spite of his bold
          political attitude, Campe dared not expose himself to the rancour of the Hamburg clergy,
          Pastor Goetze's successors in the cure of souls.</p>

        <p>It was about this time that the noble Charlotte Stieglitz committed suicide. The
          impression produced by this tragic event combined itself in Gutzkow's mind with the
          impressions made by his young friend's remark and by Reimarus's Biblical criticism--and
          _Wally, the Sceptic_, was the result.</p>

        <p>It is a childish book, this _Wally_, but it is innocent, honest, and artless. The heroine
          is a young lady moving in good society, who, in despair at not being able to overcome the
          religious doubts awakened in her mind by the man she loves, the sceptical, _blasé_ Cæsar,
          kills herself with a dagger.</p>

        <p>Gutzkow had been unable to withstand the temptation of reminding the venerable lights and
          defenders of the Church, the dignitaries of all the different classes of the Order of the
          Red Eagle, that there had once lived men named Hume, Voltaire, Lessing, &amp;c. There was
          something fascinating to a young man in the idea of reminding such grand folks of such
          forgotten existences. But it ought to have been done with talent. In Gutzkow's novel the
          plot was a mere excuse for ventilating theories, _Wally_ was a weak imitation of _Lélia_,
          the last novel which George Sand had published.</p>

        <p>But its author was in the spring-tide of his youth. It seemed to him as if the whole
          world were growing young again. The glow of Hegel's sinking sun still illuminated the
          horizon, Bettina arose like a morning star, the ever-young wisdom of Rahel was scattered
          abroad over the earth after her death like fruitful dew, Lenau's and Rückert's early poems
          were like the song of the lark, Ruge's first critical articles and Feuerbach's first
          philosophic writings were like fresh spring breezes that cleared the air--the time seemed
          to him so sunny, so promising, so laden with fruit, that it was as it were symbolised by
          the two glorious summers <pb n="245"/> of 1834 and 1835, with their rich harvests of corn
          and wine. And it was then he committed his first great youthful blunder.</p>

        <p>He was not satisfied with embodying his religious heterodoxy in his book; he also
          proclaimed his moral heterodoxy, his defiance of the accepted code of sexual morality--a
          very clumsy and immature defiance. But the best idea of how very innocently Gutzkow
          interpreted that watchword, "the emancipation of the flesh," which he himself employs, is
          to be gained from the notorious scene in _Wally_, which was intended by the author to
          express his worship of beauty.</p>

        <p>Wally loves Cæsar and is loved by him, but they cannot marry each other, because Wally
          has been obliged to betroth herself to the Sardinian ambassador. Cæsar entreats her that
          she will as it were symbolically celebrate a spiritual marriage with him by showing
          herself to him in all her naked beauty the night before her wedding. In an old German
          ballad, the heroine, Sigune, thus displays herself to Tchionatulander.</p>

        <p>No one will deny that Cæsar's request is insane and its fulfilment ridiculous. But the
          intention of the scene was so chaste and its execution so inoffensive, that only positive
          low-mindedness could have made it the occasion of calling for the assistance of the
          police. We read; "The cloak slips from the young hero's shoulders; his hair waves freely
          and luxuriantly. To the left there appears out of the sun-mist an image of intoxicating
          beauty--Sigune, displaying herself more bashfully than the Medicean Venus hides her
          nakedness. She stands there helpless, dazzled by the glamour of the love that besought
          this favour; her will is gone; she is the personification of shame, innocence, and
          self-abandonment. And in sign that this is a consecrated, holy scene, no roses bloom, but
          a high-stemmed lily has shot upwards close to her body, symbolically covering her as the
          flower of chastity. It all happened in one breathless, silent moment--it was sacrilege,
          but the sacrilege of innocence and of woeful, eternal renunciation." This is all.</p>

        <p>The relations between Gutzkow and Menzel were no longer what they had been. Now and
          again, in some <pb n="246"/> preface or article, Gutzkow had ventured to make a small joke
          at the expense of his former patron, or a modest protest against one or other of his
          utterances. And in a more practical way Gutzkow had for some time past been a thorn in the
          side to Menzel. His literary supplement to the Frankfort newspaper, _Phoenix_, was a
          dangerous rival to Menzel's _Litteraturblatt._ But there was worse than this. Gutzkow had
          gradually got into friendly correspondence with the leaders of the new literature, Laube,
          Wienbarg, Mundt, &amp;c, men who were rapidly taking possession of all the more important
          literary organs in Berlin, Leipzig, Frankfort, and Hamburg. When, in 1835, Gutzkow and
          Wienbarg issued the prospectus of a literary review in the style of _Revue des Deux
          Mondes_, with almost all the most eminent literary names in Germany on its list of
          contributors--university professors like Boeckh, influential writers like Varnhagen, not
          to mention a talented author like Börne and a genius like Heine--Menzel felt the necessity
          for striking a telling blow.</p>

        <p>An invitation to subscribe to the _Deutsche Revue_ had been published. It was written by
          Gutzkow, in flowery, metaphoric language--declares that science is longing to escape from
          musty class-rooms into the free open air, that the bird of Minerva is no longer the owl,
          which is afraid of the light, but the eagle, which gazes steadfastly into the sun,
          &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

        <p>Instead of confining his attack to this programme, which was inoffensive and in some
          respects promising, Menzel, in his _Litteraturblatt_ of the 11th and 13th September 1835,
          published a general manifesto against the company of young authors headed by Karl Gutzkow.
          The apology for this action, which he makes as an old man (in his _Memoirs_, p. 304),
          shows unquestionable proof of narrow-mindedness, but not of any honest conviction. To
          emphasise the cosmopolitan tendencies and French sympathies of Young Germany, he wrote of
          it as "La jeune Allemagne." He directed his principal attack against _Wally_, from which
          book he quoted a few disconnected passages to show that the whole novel was immoral and
          sacrilegious; the insignificant <pb n="247"/> sensual element in the story, the Sigune
          scene, is made its main feature.</p>

        <p>"Only in the deepest mire of immorality, only in brothels, are such atheistic views
          hatched. They were in vogue among the philosophical parasites of the old French court. In
          the Palais Royal they were translated from the language of the court into that of the
          Jacobins. Herr Gutzkow has taken it upon himself to transplant once again into Germany
          that infamous French ape who, in the arms of a harlot, mocks at God, but he has done it in
          an age which, praise be to God, is more mature and more manly than the age of Voltaire.
          Even then vice was foiled by the natural disposition of our nation; now it will be even
          more impossible for it to effect an entrance. Literature will expel it, public opinion
          brand it.... If such a school for the most impudent immorality and the most refined
          falsehood is allowed to establish itself in Germany, if all the noble minds of the nation
          do not set themselves against it, if German publishers do not beware, but venture to offer
          such poison for sale and to praise their wares, we shall soon see the result.... But I
          will tread down your filth, though I know that I shall defile myself by doing so; I will
          bruise the head of the serpent that warms itself in the hot-bed of sensuality.... As long
          as I live, such infamous dishonouring of German literature shall not go unpunished....</p>

        <p>And Menzel, the practical journalist, was not satisfied, like the ordinary author, with
          saying a thing once for all. He repeated his accusations in one number after another of
          his paper with growing emphasis, more abusive language, more venomous imputations,
          appealing more and more plainly to the State to interfere while it was yet time.</p>

        <p>On the 26th of October he wrote: "I know that their war against Christianity, against
          morality, against marriage is of no more significance than the war of young owls against
          the old sun. But a spark may give rise to a conflagration.... Upon the new literary
          judgment-seat in Frankfurt, Venus vulgivaga will be enthroned in place of justice ...
          never will these men, who only believe in the flesh, these priests of foulness, forgive an
          author for being purer <pb n="248"/> than they are.... Is it possible to sit still and
          allow them to propagate French morality among us by word and deed? Under the mask of
          French republicanism, this libellous, infamous new Frankfurt school is introducing the
          most frightful immorality. The flesh, unbridled sensuality, the abolition of marriage, are
          their watchwords, and they not only write obscene books themselves, but serve up the old
          ones afresh.... They are to a certain extent disciples of Saint-Simon, they proclaim a
          still more dissolute republicanism, without any virtue, a hetæra-republic on the grandest
          scale.... As yet these principles are confined to the narrower, aristocratic circles of
          literature.... But to what do these doctrines appeal but to the bestiality and ferocity
          which, though they are still slumbering, would be so easily aroused in the great capitals
          and manufacturing towns, with their obscene haunts of drunkenness and depravity."</p>

        <p>On the 11th of November Menzel directly denounces the Prussian university professors who
          have been rash enough to promise Gutzkow their co-operation in his review: "Are the
          universities not State institutions? Does the Prussian State no longer protect
          Christianity, morality, marriage? We have heard so much of the moral, religious,
          Conservative spirit that prevails in Prussia. Are we now to see the most eminent
          professors of Berlin, Königsberg, and Halle following at the heels of an obscene Marat,
          who, like the real Marat, literally preaches the sacrament of 'the irresistible moment'
          and a republic of sans-culottes and sans-chemises? Are we to hear them raving with him
          against Christianity, morality, marriage, the family, modesty, against God and
          immortality, against German nationality and the established order of things?" And he
          concluded his outburst by applying the designation of a Jewish party to the good Germans,
          Gutzkow, Wienbarg, Laube, Mundt, and Kühne, because of their sympathy with the ideas of
          Börne and Heine. Young Germany, he declared, was in reality Young Palestine.</p>

        <p>As a consequence of this denunciation, Karl Gutzkow was arrested on a charge of blasphemy
          and lewd writing, <pb n="249"/> and Menzel was dishonourable enough to go on exciting
          public indignation against him whilst he was in confinement and the case was being tried
          at Mannheim. The sentence pronounced was, however, only ten weeks' imprisonment for
          attacking the existing religious institutions of Baden.</p>

        <p>But fear of the revolutionary movements which Menzel maintained would be the result of
          the teaching of Young Germany, induced the German Confederation to take action, and on the
          10th of December 1835 the Federal Diet passed a resolution, which aimed at nothing less
          than the annihilation of the whole group of authors, young and old, which it comprehends
          under the designation Young Germany. It reads as follows: "In view of the fact that a
          school of literature has lately come into existence in Germany, a school now known by the
          name of 'Young Germany,' or 'the young literature,' whose aim is, by means of belletristic
          writings, accessible to all classes of readers, impudently to attack the Christian
          religion, to discredit the existing conditions of society, and to subvert all discipline
          and morality, the Council of the German Confederation (Bundesversammlung) ... has
          unanimously passed the following resolutions: (1) All the German Governments bind
          themselves to bring the penal and police statutes of their respective countries and the
          regulations regarding the abuse of the press in their strictest sense to bear against the
          authors, publishers, printers, and disseminators of the writings of the literary school
          known as 'Young Germany' or 'the young literature,' to which notably belong Heinrich
          Heine, Karl Gutzkow, Heinrich Laube, Ludolf Wienbarg, and Theodor Mundt, as also by all
          lawful means to prevent the dissemination of the writings of this school by booksellers,
          lending libraries, or other means," &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

        <p>It was in this manner that the appellation Young Germany first became familiar to the
          general public. It was the German Police-Confederation which, constituting itself a
          critical authority, stigmatised a group of authors, mentioned by name, as an immoral and
          injurious "school"--and this on the information of one single rival of these men in the
          favour of the reading public.</p>

        <p><pb n="250"/> Menzel was to Young Germany what Southey in his day was to the "Satanic
          school" in English literature, _alias_ Byron and Shelley, or Katkóf, a generation later,
          to the "traitorous school" in Russian literature--Herzen, Ogarev, and Bakunin. In
          disturbed times the informer is as necessary an appendage to the foreground figures as the
          envious rival and spy was to the hero of the old tragedies.</p>

          Bettlermantel so geschickt umzuschlagen wissen, dass, wenn auch der Ellenbogen
          herausguckt, man diesen Mangel für eine poetische Intention halten muss."</p>

        <p>The fellows manage to throw a kind of moral-religious-poetic beggar's cloak so cleverly
          round them, that, even if the bare elbow shows, we are obliged to consider this defect a
          poetic intention.</p>

        <p>GUTZKOW, LAUBE, MUNDT</p>

        <p>The determination of the Federal Council to suppress the writings of Young Germany not
          only nipped the _Deutsche Revue_ in the bud, but also put an end to the existence of
          Mundt's _Litterarischer Zodiacus_, published in Leipzig, and prevented the publication of
          Laube's _Mitternachtszeitung_, which was to have appeared in Brunswick. Immediately after
          Menzel's first attack on Gutzkow and his friends, Mundt, with the valour of the prudent
          man, had written a series of severe articles against Heine, Gutzkow, and Wienbarg--but all
          to no purpose; his fate was sealed.</p>

        <p>It seemed for a time as if the resolution were intended not only to affect everything
          that the proscribed authors had already written, but everything that they might write in
          the future.</p>

        <p>An edict of the Prussian Government, dated 11th December 1835, expressly provides that
          "the _future_ literary productions of Heinrich Heine, wherever they may be published and
          in whatever language, are to be subject to the same regulations as the writings of
          Gutzkow, Wienbarg, Laube, and Mundt." And not only was every possible measure taken to
          silence the obnoxious authors, but (as in Russia, when a man is in disgrace with the
          Government) it was made illegal, even for those who desired to write disparagingly of
          them, to print their names. Mundt's name was erased from the list of contributors to the
          _Berliner Jahrbücher für wissenschaftliche Kritik_, and in the announcements of Varnhagen
          and Mundt's edition of Knebel's _Literary Remains_, Varnhagen alone might be named as
          editor.</p>

        <p>Excessively strict precautions were at the same time taken with regard to foreign
          publications. A few inoffensive English and French newspapers were countenanced. In <pb
            n="252"/> the case of all the others the expedient was resorted to of requiring the same
          postage to be paid for them as for letters, thereby raising the cost of such papers to at
          least 500 thalers (£75) per annum.[1]</p>

        <p>To the leaders of Young Germany the Government thus offered the compulsory choice between
          biding their time in defiant silence and purchasing other conditions for themselves by
          disowning their past and making humiliating promises for the future. No one who has had
          any experience of the average valour of the denizens of the literary world can feel
          surprised that few stood this test, that many accepted the second alternative. Neither
          Heine, Wienbarg, nor Gutzkow gave in; but many others made pitiable exhibitions of
          themselves. Crowds of the young authors who had plumed themselves upon their
          revolutionary-philosophical, their oppositionist-political ideas, now hastened to prove
          their philosophic commonplaceness, their political innocuousness. The name "Young Germany"
          had been an honourable name; but now that those who had borne it found themselves the
          objects of special police surveillance, they refused to acknowledge it, each declaring
          that he, at least, did not belong to the party, and that if he ever had done so, it was an
          old story, and he had since then become a most respectable member of society. In this
          case, as so often, it was proved that modern high-class education only provides desultory
          knowledge, does not form character, and least of all amongst those who make their living
          by their pens.</p>

        <p>August Lewald, who to all intents and purposes belonged to the group, procured the
          annulment of the prohibition of his periodical, _Europa_, by making a declaration that he
          had never printed anything inimical to the Government, to religion, or to morality, and
          was consequently in no wise compromised by any of the mischievous proceedings of Young
          Germany. Eduard Duller, who had been co-editor with Gutzkow of the paper, _Phoenix_,
          publicly disclaimed all sympathy with the aims of Young Germany and declared his
          principles to be perfectly different from those of his <pb n="253"/> former
          fellow-workers. Theodor Mundt professed that he had always kept clear of "that
          manufactured category," Young Germany, as it was plain that such an appellation must
          sooner or later become a literary nickname (Ekelname); and in the preface to his new
          periodical, _Dioskuren für Wissenschaft und Kunst_, he declared that his aim was to
          counteract the literary excesses of recent times by the display of a settled conviction
          devoid of any principle of destructiveness (_worin nichts Verheerendes wuchert_).</p>

        <p>Meekest of all, perhaps, was Heinrich Laube, he who had been the most daring and defiant
          of the Young Germans, he whom Heine had called "one of those gladiators who die in the
          arena"--an appreciation which now seemed somewhat ridiculous. He affirmed, in the
          _Allgemeine Zeitung_, that in promising Dr. Gutzkow to contribute to his new review, he
          had never dreamt of aiding and abetting the party known by the name of Young Germany in
          its attacks on the existing conditions of society, much less in its attempts to disturb
          and overturn them. On the contrary, he had from the first plainly signified that he did
          not identify himself with the movement.</p>

        <p>On New Year's day, 1836, in the announcement of his _Mitternachtszeitung_, which he had
          obtained permission to publish on condition that his name did not appear as editor, he
          wrote that he had become another man, that literature was no longer to him an expression
          of political desires, that it was not his intention to take any part in the literary
          disputes of the moment, "the rough-and-tumble fights with uncombed hair and unwashed
          hands"; no, it had long been his idea to form "a neo-Romantic school," and in it he would
          have no disintegrating, destructive elements. He would support the existing, not make war
          upon it. He would not identify himself with Menzel (actually!) but neither could he take
          part with the so-called Young Germany. He who had been the most daring of them all was the
          quickest and most adroit in wheeling round.</p>

        <p>Day after day, too, as was to be expected, the newspapers contained declarations by the
          different university professors who had been incautious enough to promise their
            co-opera<pb n="254"/>tion in the _Deutsche Revue_. Ulrici, Eduard Gans, Hotho,
          Rosenkranz and Trendelenburg, Hegelians and Anti-Hegelians, all, one after the other,
          cleared themselves from the charge of complicity. They repented with their official souls.
          They vied with each other in their utter repudiation of Gutzkow.</p>

        <p>Heine did not belong to the number of those who lose their courage or their heads in a
          difficulty. And in any case, partly because of his established reputation, partly because
          of the personal security ensured by his residence abroad, this interdict was not such a
          serious blow to him as to the others. On the 28th of January 1836, after receiving
          intimation of the prohibition of his books, he addressed a solemn protest to the Federal
          Diet, a proceeding about which he immediately afterwards jokes in a private letter to his
          publisher. In this protest he expresses his astonishment at having been judged without a
          trial, and without having been given any opportunity to defend himself. He reminds the
          Federal Diet that Martin Luther did not meet with such treatment at the hands of the Holy
          Roman Empire--not that he would think of comparing himself with Luther, "but the pupil
          naturally appeals to the precedent of his master." But what he especially desires to
          protest against is his compulsory silence (which he was privately determined to break as
          soon as possible) being taken for an admission of culpable intentions, or even for a
          disavowal of his earlier writings. To Laube, of whose new attitude he was still ignorant,
          he wrote about the same time that, in the matter of politics, it was, for the present,
          allowable to make any number of concessions, political forms being of no consequence as
          long as the conflict for the highest life-principles was still going on; but they must
          hold to their right of free discussion of religious and moral topics, or there would soon
          be an end of all Protestant liberty of thought. Laube, as we know, finding himself obliged
          to give in to a certain extent, gave in all round at once, struck simultaneously his
          political, religious, and moral flags.</p>

        <p>It was a slight consolation to the sufferers that the <pb n="255"/> informer did not go
          unpunished. Heine wrote _Ueber den Denunzianten_ and Börne wrote _Menzel der
          Franzosenfresser_ ("The Frenchman-eater"), which is with reason regarded as his wittiest
          and at the same time most warm-hearted production.</p>

        <p>But the more severe punishment came from Heine, who threw himself upon his victim with
          all his tiger-like strength, and shook him till there was nothing left of him but a
          shapeless, ridiculous bundle.</p>

        <p>Heine points out how carefully Menzel has chosen the time for making his accusations, a
          time when the leaders of the movement were either in exile, or silent, or in safe keeping
          behind bolts and bars. He exposes Menzel's hypocrisy, showing how, as long as he was
          connected with Gutzkow, he looked on silently, though he knew Christianity to be in peril
          of its life. He is quite ready to give him credit for "a certain physical morality"--for a
          man can be virtuous alone, but to be vicious he must have a companion. Herr Menzel's
          personal appearance stands him in good stead when he is desirous to flee from vice. Heine
          has far too high an opinion of the good taste of vice to be able to believe that it would
          run after a Menzel. Poor Goethe was not so fortunately gifted in this particular. Of
          Menzel's political opinions Heine is afraid to speak for political reasons. Nor can he say
          what he thinks of his private life (as if by a printer's error _Privatschelmenleben_ is
          substituted for _Privatmenschenleben_) in the first instance for want of space.</p>

        <p>Never did Heine write anything at once so insulting and so crushing.</p>

        <p>And how did matters stand with Gutzkow, who at the early age of twenty-four had become a
          kind of centre of literary events, and upon whom "the Goliath of the Philistine army" had
          fallen? For a moment he was astonished and cast down. It was his first instructive
          experience of life. His sin was that he had expressed his feelings naïvely and honestly in
          a second-rate novel, and its result was that he now found himself denounced as a plague of
          society, mocked at by his enemies, forsaken and disowned by his friends. With perfect calm
          he heard himself compared to <pb n="256"/> the men who had prepared for the enormities
          perpetrated at Minister under Jan van Leyden--division of property, marriage with twelve
          wives, &amp;c. He was inexperienced enough to look forward to the legal proceedings
          against him with expectations of victory, and when he was arrested at Mannheim, he went to
          prison with a feeling of relief. In prison he did not hear the yelling of the press; he
          heard nothing but the squeaking of the mice that ran over his bed. He could lead a
          peaceful life, a life of uninterrupted, quiet production. He wrote his novel _Seraphine_
          and a work entitled _Philosophic der That und des Ereignisses_ ("Philosophy of Action and
          Event"), a kind of criticism of Hegel's _Philosophy of History_. When he came out of
          prison he took up his life-work again with firm determination, but for a time wrote
          anonymously and expressed himself more cautiously.</p>

        <p>About a year before this he had fallen in love with a young girl in Berlin, and become
          engaged to her. But the Berlin newspapers called him an atheist. The young lady's mother
          was a foolish, hysterical woman. One day she would embrace Gutzkow, the next threaten to
          throw a knife at him and shriek to her daughter, "Choose between him and me!" As the
          wisdom of allowing her daughter to unite her fate with Gutzkow's became more and more
          questionable, the mother's amiable days became fewer, the unamiable more frequent, and in
          the end the young lady, as an obedient daughter, drew back altogether. This episode had
          made a tremendous impression on Gutzkow's young heart. It had taught him that to hold
          convictions contrary to those of the people one lives amongst isolates a man even in
          private life, and that he who sets the opinion of his neighbours at defiance cannot expect
          to be successful in life or in love.</p>

        <p>His friends behaved no better to him. No sooner was he released from prison than he was
          overwhelmed with reproaches and complaints by persons to whom he had previously promised
          literary employment, and who were now not only disappointed in their hopes, but
          compromised by the patronage he had extended to them.</p>

        <p>His first disappointment in love led to one of his best shorter stories, _Der Sadducäer
          von Amsterdam_. And the <pb n="257"/> disappointment, combined with the general
          disillusionment, produced the frame of mind which characterises the dramatised version of
          the story which he published many years later under the title of _Uriel
          Acosta_--undoubtedly his best drama, probably his best work.</p>

        <p>The hero is a historic personage, Gabriel, afterwards Uriel Acosta, born in 1594, a
          religious philosopher of Jewish nationality. His parents were baptised Christians, but he
          himself, on account of his disbelief in Christianity, was obliged to leave his native
          land, Portugal, and take refuge in Holland. Then he threw in his lot with the Jews, but
          soon began to publish works in which the Jewish doctrines were as freely criticised as the
          Christian. For this he was condemned to pay fines, and in the end was sentenced to a most
          humiliating penance. After public acknowledgment and recantation of his errors, he was to
          lie on the ground at the threshold of the synagogue and allow himself to be trodden under
          foot by the whole congregation of the faithful. After seven years of persecution he
          submitted to the sentence, but immediately afterwards, in despair at having retracted his
          opinions, shot himself (in 1647). He was the forerunner, and, if we may believe tradition,
          the teacher of Spinoza.</p>

        <p>In the little old-fashioned story, _Der Sadducäer von Amsterdam_, the most important
          personages of the future drama are outlined. Judith, the vacillating and finally faithless
          woman, beloved of Acosta, was very evidently suggested by the inconstant Berlin lady. The
          style is artless and weak. Spinoza is introduced as follows: "She called, and her only
          child, a boy of seven, came running up to his uncle, whom he easily recognised in the
          moonlight. Bare your heads! That boy was Baruch Spinoza!"</p>

        <p>What attracted Gutzkow as a young man to this theme was evidently its pathos, its being
          the story of the first martyr for free-thought.</p>

        <p>In our days we read of such a life without being remarkably impressed by it. The
          spiritually emancipated know that all the advance that has been made amounts to this, that
          they are now tolerated. The life that they have lived has so accustomed them to hear all
          that they hold highest <pb n="258"/> condemned, and all that they regard as base or
          foolish extolled, that no story of this kind affects them much.</p>

        <p>It was different with the generation of 1830 in Germany. Even the fact that Uriel Acosta
          sued for pardon and recanted did not lessen Gutzkow's interest in him. In the novel he
          writes: "We who have been, as it were, born into a state of constant martyrdom for the
          sake of our convictions, who have lived in it all our lives, must refrain from condemning
          a man who had the courage to protest against the dogmas of a fanatical, intolerant
          religion, but who, nevertheless, was capable of cringing beneath the hand that had
          chastised him." He depicts the confusion in Uriel's soul: Faith is the blind man's staff;
          his eyes are suddenly opened; but they are utterly unaccustomed to distinguish objects;
          they cannot, like the staff to which he has been so long accustomed, save him from
          falling; and so he gropes more helplessly than before.</p>

        <p>After the storm raised by Menzel had passed in all its fury over Gutzkow's head, the
          story of Acosta inevitably acquired quite a new significance for him. Considering it now,
          he saw not only its purely dramatic possibilities, but the correspondence of its main
          features with the main features of his own life story. He, too, had been placed under ban
          and interdict; he, too, after being cursed, had been deserted; he, too, had paid the
          penalty of intrepid thought; he, too, had been flung on the ground before the threshold of
          the injured Church, and the whole multitude had passed over him and trampled on him.</p>

        <p>In 1846, in Paris, under the influence of the acting of great tragedians, Gutzkow
          dramatised the story. He made various alterations in it. To increase the interest of the
          plot, he idealised the chief female character. In the tragedy of _Uriel Acosta_, Judith is
          the betrothed of another; Uriel is her master. But when the Rabbis, with solemn ceremony,
          pronounced the terrible curse, when all draw back from him and he is left alone on one
          side of the stage, whilst the words:</p>

        <p> "Fluch dem Freund Der Dir im Elend je die Treue hält! Nie giebt sich Dir ein liebend
          Herz des Weibes,"[2]</p>

        <p><pb n="259"/> are being spoken, she crosses the stage and places herself by his side with
          the famous and beautiful speech ending with the line:</p>

        <p> "Er _wird_ geliebt! Glaubt besseren Propheten!"[3]</p>

        <p>Of a personage who hardly appears at all in the novel, Gutzkow made an imperishable
          character, the best and most original in the drama, the aged Chief Rabbi, Ben Akiba. This
          old man has in reality only one conclusive speech, which he repeats again and again to
          Uriel and to the others:</p>

        <p> "Es war alles da." (This has all been before.)</p>

        <p>Admirable words! Ben Akiba is age, that has seen all these things before, seen the Church
          attacked, seen the Church triumphant, seen sceptics and champions arise, seen them
          humiliated, defeated, dead, and buried. The others believe that this is something new; it
          is all old, it all leads to no result. Ben Akiba is dogmatic conservatism in human form;
          he is experience, shaking its heavy head. If youth were to listen to him, despairing
          indifference would be the inevitable result.</p>

        <p>Uriel lets himself be persuaded to recant. He does it for his mother's and Judith's sake.
          His old, blind, believing mother comes to him, and in a scene which never fails to affect
          the audience, persuades him to recant and submit to the ignominious punishment--persuades
          only by her silent dignity and the strength of her love, without a single entreaty to do
          this or anything else for her sake. Uriel takes the step, hoping that it will remove a
          weight from his mother's heart and make it possible for him to marry Judith. But whilst he
          is still in prison preparing for the penance, his mother dies, and Judith is forced to
          marry Ben Jochai. He degrades himself in vain. Judith poisons herself, and he (the drama
          in this point keeping to fact) shoots himself.</p>

        <p>By reason of its theme, the tragedy of _Uriel Acosta_ occupies a unique place in the
          German literature of the day. It is a tragedy of free-thought, a drama that gives us a
          better <pb n="260"/> idea than anything else does of the period which produced it--a
          period of energetic struggle for liberty, and of still more energetic oppression--and of
          the spirit of that Young Germany which was so gallant in advance, but so prone to
          defection and retractation. It is a play, too, which bears unmistakable testimony to its
          author's qualities of head and heart. Any one who compares Gutzkow's _Uriel Acosta_ with
          Heine's _Almansor_, will subscribe to the affirmation already made, that the best men of
          Young Germany in their best moments displayed a manly earnestness which we do not find in
          Heine.</p>

        <p>On the German stage _Uriel Acosta_ has now long been a favourite play. The pure style and
          the treatment of the subject remind us of Lessing's _Nathan der Weise_, but in energy and
          pathos Gutzkow in this case surpasses Lessing. In spite of some weak parts, such as the
          Spinoza scene, the dramatic construction is excellent.</p>

        <p>Of all Gutzkow's works, this play has had the widest circulation. It has been translated
          into all the Slavonic and all the Latin languages, into English, Hungarian, and
          Swedish.</p>

        <p>In Germany it was for a time, as Gutzkow himself aptly remarked, a sort of barometer
          indicating the state of public opinion. When the ecclesiastical reaction was in the
          ascendant, it was prohibited in many of the theatres. When there was a change of system,
          the prohibition was cancelled. It is significant that in Austria its performance was
          always permitted in the provinces, but that the Concordat with the Pope stood in the way
          of its being played in the Burg Theater of Vienna. As was to be expected, the play was
          long in reaching Denmark; it was first played there in the Nineties.</p>

        <p>After 1835 Gutzkow writes nothing childish or crude. From this time onwards he is the
          great, indefatigable literary worker; a student and critic who possessed the faculty of
          discerning and explaining the relation in which all characters, past or present, stood to
          the requirements and problems of his day; an acute distinguisher of the various drifts of
          the times; a psychologist distinguished for his understanding of <pb n="261"/> individual
          character. His _Goethe_ (1836) is a thoughtful little work, in the first instance a
          protest against Menzel; his long series of portraits (_Zeitgenossen_, afterwards
          _Säkularbilder_) show qualities which somewhat later stood him in good stead as a
          novelist; his _Life of Börne_ (1840) is a tribute to the memory of that progenitor of
          Young Germany and a challenge to Heine, whose injudicious and ungenerous work on Börne had
          lowered him in the estimation of the young generation.</p>

        <p>A special interest attaches to Gutzkow's dramatic attempts from the fact that he and
          Laube were the first German authors of any position since the days of Kleist to connect
          themselves with the theatre and to win an honourable place for themselves on the German
          stage. Gutzkow makes a laboured beginning with sentimental dramas that no longer satisfy
          the public taste. His _Richard Savage, oder der Sohn einer Mutter_ (1839) is from
          beginning to end a high-flown extravaganza. A talented English poet, who has grown up in
          ignorance of his parentage, discovers his mother in a beautiful, brilliant, aristocratic
          woman of the world, who refuses to acknowledge him or to have anything whatever to do with
          him. The play is a series of representations of his fruitless attempts to win this
          mother's cold heart. _Werner, oder Herz und Welt_ (1840), is a pathetic, middle-class
          drama, turning on a theme on which Gutzkow rang many changes, the struggle in a man's
          heart between an old attachment and a more recently formed connection. Heinrich Werner has
          allowed himself to be adopted by people in a position above his own. He has been ennobled
          under the name of von Jordan, and has deserted a poor but charming young girl in order to
          marry a lady of position. But in his new, affluent circumstances, he misses his former
          plain, studious life, and, most of all, Marie Winter, the girl to whom he had been
          engaged, and whom he cannot forget. He suddenly meets her again as governess in his own
          house. He is long distracted between his duty to his wife and his attraction to this girl,
          whom he is determined to love only platonically, but whom he really loves above
          everything. At last things come to a crisis. The wife asserts her rights, rights that
          Heinrich refuses to <pb n="262"/> acknowledge. His morality is a higher, a freer than
          hers. She "shudders at his principles." The knot is finally cut by a _deus ex machinâ_. A
          young friend of Heinrich's comes to an agreement with Marie that he and she will marry,
          and so prevent the breaking up of the family. The tragic motive is thus, we observe,
          deprived of its point.</p>

        <p>The first of Gutzkow's plays that it still gives one a reasonable amount of pleasure to
          see is _Zopf und Schwert_ ("Pigtail and Sword"), written in 1843. It is a play which has
          kept its place on the German stage, but which never gained a firm footing outside of
          Germany from the fact of its being a species of national drama. The beat of a Prussian's
          heart is felt in it. Gutzkow's aim was to represent Frederick William I. and his court in
          a comedy like those which Scribe was bringing out so successfully about the same time. The
          historic appreciation is, however, far from being so superficial as in Scribe's comedies.
          Gutzkow had an eye for the admirable as well as for the comical qualities of the miserly
          family tyrant, the monarch of Spartan severity. But the very fact of the play being a
          comedy made a really profound study of the character an impossibility. And it was not
          Gutzkow's habit, and still less was it Laube's, to investigate into historical characters
          and situations until they arrived at the historic, as opposed to the traditional truth.
          Their history was simply the vehicle of a more or less cleverly concocted plot. We have
          only to open the first volume of Carlyle's _Frederick the Great_ to find such an immensely
          more powerful and impressive picture of the eccentric Prussian king with his tall
          grenadiers, that Gutzkow's in comparison shrinks into a mild pleasantry. And we have only
          to look at a few pages of the Memoirs of Gutzkow's heroine, Wilhelmine of Bayreuth, to see
          that in the relations between her and her father there was no suggestion of comedy. But,
          putting aside all thought of historical correctness, we have a very pretty intrigue-play,
          with a historic colouring which cannot fail to appeal to lovers of Prussia. _Zopf und
          Schwert_ is a species of light-hearted pendant to Kleist's serious _Prins von
          Homburg_.</p>

        <p>Of the other plays written by Gutzkow in the Forties, _Das <pb n="263"/> Urbild des
          Tartüffe_ ("The Prototype of Tartuffe") has been the most successful, but it is a much
          over-estimated work. A very charming little work is _Der Königslieutenant_, an unassuming
          play, written for Goethe's centenary, and treating of him in his youthful days.</p>

        <p>The long historical novels, _Die Ritter vom Geist_ ("The Knights of the Spirit"), _Der
          Zauberer von Rom_ ("The Roman Magician"), &amp;c, which Gutzkow wrote during the reaction
          period after 1848, and which immensely strengthened his hold over the minds of his
          contemporaries, do not come within the scope of the present work. They were the
          forerunners of Spielhagen's long series of novels.</p>

        <p>Next to Gutzkow, Heinrich Laube (born in Sprottau, in Silesia, in 1806) was the most
          eminent member of the new group. He is a clear-cut type, a man with plenty of fresh,
          vigorous talent, exuberant spirits, an intuitive perception of what is effective, a gift
          of slight, but in most instances adequate character delineation, and, to start with, many
          daring but shallow and second-hand ideas. He is not devoid of feeling, nor totally devoid
          of earnestness, but his distinguishing quality is his brisk, energetic practicalness.
          Between 1826 and 1832 he studied theology at Halle and Breslau. In 1832 he embarked on the
          career of a journalist in Leipzig. In his unpedantic literary style, as also in his
          outward appearance, there was something that seemed to point to Slavonic blood in his
          veins. As a student he loved to go about in a Polish braided coat, and eccentric caps and
          cloaks of his own invention. He wrote with a fluency and vehemence, with a crude
          naturalness and a want of exactitude which were not German. His blood was hot and flowed
          quickly; he had the sanguine, choleric temperament, without a touch of melancholy.</p>

        <p>As a member of a student's union (Burschenschaft) and because he had given too free
          expression to his sympathy with the Revolution of July and its results in Germany, he was,
          in 1834, expelled from Saxony and sentenced to nine months' imprisonment in Berlin. In the
          introduction to his drama, _Monaldeschi_, we find an account of his life in prison, of the
          monotony of that beautiful summer of 1834, <pb n="264"/> which he spent in his cell,
          without a book--nothing but a bed, a table, a stool, and a pitcher of water. He also gives
          an indirect and more effective description of the same experience in the Third Part of
          _Das junge Europa_, where Valerius, upon scraps of paper procured with the greatest
          difficulty, writes his impressions during a long confinement in a Prussian prison.</p>

        <p>We know what his conduct was after the Federal Council had prohibited his writings as
          belonging to the Young German school; but to judge him fairly we must remember that this
          blow came upon him immediately after his release, and that, in spite of his subsequent
          cautious behaviour, he was again, soon after his marriage in 1837, condemned to
          imprisonment for participation in the doings of the Burschenschaften. This time the
          punishment was mild, thanks apparently to the protection of Prince Pückler-Muskau. The
          place of imprisonment was a country house on the Prince's property of Muskau; for a cell
          he was given a hall; instead of a skylight he had eight windows, looking in three
          different directions. Even a short daily walk in the famous park was permitted. He might
          read and write as much as he chose. His wife shared his imprisonment. From this time
          onwards he shows extreme moderation in politics. When, in 1848, he is elected a member of
          the German National Assembly, he sides, not with the republican, but with the
          "hereditary-imperial" party.</p>

        <p>Laube makes his début in literature as a disciple of Heine. His _Reisenovellen_, a long
          series of volumes, are the direct offspring of the _Reisebilder_. But along with the
          influence of Heine we trace that of Heinse. From Heine Laube takes liveliness and
          ingenuity of style, and also to a certain extent the personal coxcombry by which we are
          sometimes very unpleasantly affected; but it is from Wilhelm Heinse, for whom he had an
          extreme admiration, and whose works he edited, that he derives the undisguised sensualism
          which displays itself in a positive cult of woman's outward charms constantly and loudly
          proclaimed. In Heinse's case this worship of female form and colouring, this adoration of
          the fleshly, is more primitive, more naïvely Bacchanalian, <pb n="265"/> more sincerely
          religious, than in Laube's. Laube at times offends by coarseness, at times by an almost
          personal boastfulness of woman-killing qualities, and at times it is too perceptible that
          he is writing for the purpose of annoying his respectable neighbours.</p>

        <p>When, in his old age, he began to republish his youthful works, the new generation were
          astounded by the breaches of good taste which youthful readers some forty years before had
          admired, and many assented to the severe judgment which had lately been passed on him by
          Emil Kuh in the chapter on Young Germany contained in his book on Hebbel. But it is unfair
          to allow a little coarseness and want of taste here and there to keep us from estimating
          Laube's work in its integrity.</p>

        <p>In the _Reisenovellen_, in spite of the off-hand way in which they are written, there is
          little originality. At the very beginning, in the division entitled _Leipzig_, with its
          French sympathies and its reverence of Napoleon, there is too strong a suggestion of the
          _Reisebilder_. Laube, like Heine, in his childhood saw the great Emperor; so he gives us
          to understand, but in such an uncertain manner that we are left in doubt as to whether it
          was in a dream or in reality; and Laube, too, has--in the person of Gardy the dragoon--his
          drummer Legrand.</p>

        <p>Those who wish to get a real, full impression of what Laube was as a young man, ought to
          read his novel, _Das junge Europa_ (4 vols. 1833-37). A whole, long stage of his
          development is placed clearly before us in this now pardonably forgotten book, which
          retains its interest only for the historian. Its three parts--the Poets, The Soldiers, The
          Citizens--are three works differing very much from each other in kind and in quality.</p>

        <p>In the First Part the author is completely under the influence of Heinse's _Ardinghello_.
          "The Poets" is a sort of prose hymn to female beauty and free love, in the old-fashioned
          form of a novel in letters, which communicate the love fates of about a dozen people. When
          the reader has struggled through them, there is left on his mind an impression of the wild
          ecstatic desire of young, vigorous, hopeful <pb n="266"/> men, and of the resolute
          self-surrender of young and daring or tender women, the impression of a generation in
          whose veins glows a desire for liberty--political, social, erotic--which breaks down all
          forms and all conventions. We see into an imaginary, romantic world, the world of Laube's
          youthful dreams, where there is abundance of power and of life, and of illusions as to the
          renovation of the world by means of revolutions of various kinds. It is a romance of
          beautiful bodies and beautiful souls, male and female, the essence of whose being is
          revolt against Christianity and against marriage.</p>

        <p>Between the First and the Second Part, a considerable change has evidently come over the
          author's views; he has received his impression of the strength of the reaction; he has
          ripened into a man. In the First Part one could hardly help mixing up the characters, for
          the men were only distinguished from each other by their more or less fiery, erotic,
          uncontrollable temperaments, the woman only by the dissimilarity of their physical charms;
          in the Second Part we are introduced into a world where a real struggle for national and
          political liberty is going on. The letter form is abandoned, and there are comparatively
          few characters.</p>

        <p>It is the revolt of Poland which is described; Valerius, one of the principal characters
          in the First Part, is led by his enthusiasm for liberty in general to join the Poles. The
          subject-matter is interesting, though here and there we have too much of the purely
          historical. The Poles as a people are described impartially and with a sure touch; their
          characteristics--the strong patriotic feeling inspiring high and low, the prejudices and
          tyranny of the nobility, the savagery and vigour of the lower classes--are depicted as
          they mirror themselves in the mind of the German volunteer. The distrust with which he, as
          a foreigner, is received, the want of liberal-mindedness in the devotees of liberty, which
          he observes more especially in their conduct to his friend, a Polish officer of Jewish
          descent, gradually dissipate the illusions which he had cherished of a golden future for
          Europe, the final outcome of the Revolution of July. There is a tragic tone throughout the
          book. We are shown<pb n="267"/> how fruitless the rebellion of the Poles is, how it ends,
          as it was fated to end, in crushing defeat; and we are shown how the young Jew, Joel, in
          spite of his valiant endeavours on the battlefield to gain for himself those rights which
          his aristocratic countrymen enjoy, can never rise from his position as the pariah of
          Polish society. The woman he loves dares not give him her hand; a common peasant disdains
          his sympathy. After the revolt is suppressed, he puts off his uniform in despair and
          shoulders the pedlar's wallet. The Christians repudiate him, the Jews he himself long ago
          alienated by his alliance with the Christians, his humanity gives him no rights; there is
          nothing for it but to forget his learning, his philosophy, his scientific and military
          talent, and to wander from village to village, selling ribbons, as his forefathers
          did.</p>

        <p>This character has a special interest for Danes, as it evidently suggested to Goldschmidt
          some of the leading characteristics of the hero of his novel, _En Jöde_ ("A Jew"); he,
          too, becomes a Polish officer during the struggle for liberty, and he too, repulsed
          everywhere, in the bitterness of despair ends his career as a money-lender, outside the
          pale of society.</p>

        <p>The Third Part of _Das junge Europa_ ("The Citizens") is an inferior production. Its
          chief interest for us lies in what it tells us of two of the most enthusiastic,
          indomitable heroes of the First Part, Hippolyt and Constantin. Hippolyt is finally driven
          to despair by the civilisation of the modern world, which leaves no room for the great
          exception, but requires all to be alike small. The bold Constantin, who fought in the
          streets of Paris in the Days of July, makes his appearance not very many years later as a
          Prussian judge, inflexibly, fanatically severe in his dealings with political
          revolutionaries. Constantin enters into long explanations of the influences that have
          wrought the change in his convictions (this character was evidently drawn from the life);
          but the author is still so possessed by the ideals of his own youth, that he makes this
          man commit suicide in despair at having been unfaithful to these ideals.</p>

        <p>From the year 1849 till his death in the Eighties, Laube, as is well known, devoted all
          his powers to the theatre. He <pb n="268"/> speedily became the best and most highly
          esteemed theatrical manager of Germany and Austria. As such he always retained a
          preference for the French drama. What he himself wrote for the stage is what will keep his
          name longest in remembrance.</p>

        <p>Of the many historical dramas which he produced, the most important--_Monaldeschi_
          (1834), _Struensee_ (1844), and _Die Karlsschüler_ (1847)--are suggestive of the ideals of
          Young Germany as they took shape in Laube's mind. The last-mentioned play became popular
          and is still often put on the stage; the others are effective pieces in a style that is
          now obsolete.</p>

        <p>The character of Monaldeschi is a vigorous conception. He is the bold, unscrupulous
          adventurer, who has no higher aim than to make his way and to enjoy life to the full, but
          who understands the meaning of power, and desires to use his power worthily--the Hippolyt
          of _Das junge Europa_ in historic costume. With Queen Christina's more complex feminine
          character, Laube has not been so successful, though his representation of her has elements
          out of which a good actress could make a telling part. But the play as a whole is
          overweighted by the intolerable sentimentality of the love scenes (Monaldeschi has a
          romantic attachment to a certain Sylva Brahe), and it suffers as a work of art from its
          author's dread of offending a Philistine public's sense of propriety. The real relations
          between Christina and Monaldeschi are smoothed down into indistinctness. The sharp edges
          of historic fact are filed away to make the subject fit into the mould of theatrical
          Romanticism.</p>

        <p>In _Struensee_, the second of Laube's dramas in which the action passes at a Scandinavian
          court, still greater liberties have been taken with history and historical characters.
          Laube makes Struensee the noble, liberty-loving reformer, whose only fault is an excessive
          German humanity, which shrinks from shedding blood. Had he only been a trifle less
          high-minded and scrupulous, he might easily have remained in power. The weakness that is
          his ruin is his chivalrous, platonic devotion to Caroline Mathilde, who returns the
          sentiment in an equally innocent manner. <pb n="269"/> Christian VII. is represented as an
          estimable, somewhat taciturn monarch, subject to attacks of melancholy. Struensee's fall
          is brought about entirely by Germans, who are partly envious of him, partly enraged
          because he will not comply with their unreasonable wishes; and the bitter moral of the
          play is, that the worst enemies of a German intellectual hero are his own
          countrymen--Germans have always had to suffer most from Germans, who show their want of
          patriotism even in their relations with foreigners.</p>

        <p>Quite apart from the historic inaccuracy of the character, the sentimentally erotic
          Struensee, with "his enthusiasm for all that is noble and beautiful," is a very impossible
          parvenu minister of state. Laube has tampered with facts to the extent of representing
          Struensee's death as the result of a shot fired, by order of Guldberg, at the moment of
          his arrest in the castle on the 17th of January 1772. The chief reason, and at the same
          time excuse, for all this perversion of facts lay in the necessity for presenting them in
          such a shape that the censorship might not forbid the play on account of the possibility
          of its giving offence to a friendly power. We get some idea of how severe this censorship
          was, when we read that, in spite of Laube's precautions, the performance of _Struensee_
          was for many years prohibited in Prussia, out of consideration for the feelings of the
          Danish royal family.</p>

        <p>It is, nevertheless, impossible to understand why such a perfectly harmless and
          studiously, punctiliously, inoffensive play as _Die Karlsschüler_ should, immediately
          after its appearance in 1846, have been prohibited throughout Austria, Prussia, Hanover,
          Würtemberg, Hesse-Cassel, all the Grand Duchies and several of the Duchies. It is in
          reality nothing whatever but a panegyric on the youthful Schiller, in a representation of
          the well-known difficulties he got into as a young regimental surgeon in the service of
          Duke Karl of Würtemberg, ending with his flight from Stuttgart to Mannheim. It forms a
          parallel to Gutzkow's Goethe comedy, _Der Königslieutenant_, which it surpasses in
          dramatic vigour. In this case, too, Laube has sacrificed strict historic truth. Duke
          Karl's character is softened and toned down exactly <pb n="270"/> as King Frederick
          William's was in Gutzkow's _Zopf und Schwert_. This is not only art which is compelled to
          be cautious, but art which has come into being under the oppression of a tradition which
          has insinuated itself into the very disposition of the artist. But the disposition was a
          cheerful, buoyant one, and the hand that wrote these scenes was light and skilful.
          Something of the lustre that surrounds its hero's name is shed upon the play. It is
          probable that as long as Schiller retains his great popularity in Germany, Germans will
          enjoy seeing this transcription of his youthful history--though they know many facts
          concerning that history now that were not known at the time _Die Karlsschüler_ was
          written. Such a play is not calculated to produce much effect out of Germany.</p>

        <p>After Gutzkow's and Laube's, Mundt's is the name that occurs most frequently when mention
          is made of the leaders of Young Germany. It is about the year 1835 that Mundt is most
          distinctly the mouthpiece of the feelings and ideas of that school. In 1835 he published
          _Charlotte Stieglitz, ein Denkmal_, the only one of his historical delineations which had
          any real influence on the minds of the youth of the day. This work, no doubt chiefly owing
          to its subject, but also to its pathetic, affectionately reverent treatment of that
          subject, took thousands of hearts by storm. In the same year appeared his _Madonna,
          Unterhaltungen mit einer Heiligen_ ("Converse with a Saint"), which, more than any other
          of his works, gives expression to the sentiments of Young Germany, and a clue to the
          character of its author.</p>

        <p>Theodor Mundt, born at Potsdam in 1808, was a man capable of enthusiastic, yet
          clear-sighted devotion to causes and to persons. He had Wienbarg's enthusiastic
          temperament (though not his bravery), with a much more highly gifted, many-sided mind. And
          yet there was no edge or pungency in his wit, no grace in his whimsicality, no method in
          his works, no conciseness in his style. His book on Charlotte Stieglitz is the only one of
          his works that has survived him, and it has done so thanks to its subject. He could be
          caustic and biting and unjust, as weak natures are apt to be, but even his most caustic
          tirades are not the <pb n="271"/> expression of any warlike inclination; they are only
          penned in self-defence and self-assertion, are called forth by some misunderstanding on
          the part of an opponent, and are no more dangerous than the thrusts of an angry
          wether.</p>

        <p>It is surprising to the modern reader that a work like Mundt's _Madonna_ can ever have
          been considered a dangerous book. To understand how this could be, we must keep in mind
          that those in power at the time of its publication stood in terror of shadows. It is,
          however, a book which must not be overlooked by any one who is making a study of the
          period, for there is something typical in its expression of the thoughts and enthusiasms
          of the youth of the day.</p>

        <p>In its very formlessness, _Madonna_ is characteristic of Mundt, and of those whose
          literary taste was identical with his. It contains prose lyric effusions, descriptions of
          travel, personal confessions, world-revolutionising theories of the rehabilitation of the
          flesh by means of a hitherto unknown mystic creed--all this grouped round a central female
          figure and interwoven with her story.</p>

        <p>The book opens with a "post-horn symphony," well written in the old Romantic style, but
          not Romantic in tendency. It is a glorification of "movement," the shibboleth which Mundt
          invented and fell in love with. Movement is to him what progress and the struggle for
          freedom were to others--the watchword of the new era. He talks of the party of movement;
          the new literature is to him the literature of movement (_Bewegungslitteratur_); in a
          postscript to _Madonna_ he calls that book _ein Bewegungsbuch_. We perceive that the
          expression is perfectly neutral and innocent.</p>

        <p>The only readable part of _Madonna_ nowadays is the heroine's narrative of her life
          experiences. The author meets her in a little Bohemian village; when he first sees her,
          walking in a Roman Catholic procession, he is tremendously impressed by her extraordinary
          beauty. Later in the same day he accidently makes his way into her father's cottage, wins
          the narrow-minded, bigoted old man's heart (in a very improbable manner) by the unction
          with which he tells him the story of Casanova, who had at one time lived in that <pb
            n="272"/> neighbourhood in the castle of Dux, receives an invitation to supper, and
          spends part of the night in a sentimental conversation with the daughter, whom he
          discovers to be a woman deserving, in his estimation, the name of saint--a secular or
          worldly saint (_eine Weltheilige_)--and who, in that capacity, embraces and kisses him,
          weeping hot tears. He is obliged to leave the neighbourhood next morning, but soon
          afterwards receives from her an immoderately lengthy letter--_Die Bekenntnisse einer
          weltlichen Seele_ ("The Confessions of a Worldly Soul")--in which she makes a frank
          revelation of herself and all her experiences.</p>

        <p>This beautiful girl is an unfortunate victim. She has been enticed by a relative, a
          depraved woman, to leave Teplitz, her native town, where she lived in poverty with her
          parents, and come to Dresden. There, under the pretext of providing for her future, this
          woman educated her for a rich debauchee, a man of high position, whose prey she was to
          become as soon as she was grown up. The time comes; all preparations are made; at night
          she is locked into a room with her benefactor and pursuer, whom she loathes. She forcibly
          breaks away from him, manages to get out, and, in her despair, seeing a light in the room
          of a young theological student who lives in the same house, takes refuge with him. She has
          long loved this young man and he her. Now with chaste passion she gives herself to him,
          and he cannot find it in his heart to repulse her. But on the following day, repenting as
          a Christian of his sin, he commits suicide. The young girl has to make her way on foot
          from Dresden to her native village in Bohemia, where, after her experience of the life and
          variety of a great town, she pines in sadness and loneliness. Her old father, with whom
          she lives, is a cripple and a fanatically bigoted Roman Catholic.</p>

        <p>The point in this story evidently lies in the innocence of the young girl's
          self-abandonment, innocence which the world calls guilt. To the author his heroine is a
          saint, a Madonna, the type of lovable womanliness. She is a carnal saint, undoubtedly; but
          it is his creed that we can conceive of nothing more holy, that there exists nothing more
          spiritual, <pb n="273"/> than the carnal. And he propounds a neither new nor remarkable,
          but somewhat peculiarly formulated theory of the necessity for a fusion of flesh and
          spirit, for the abolition of the distinction between spiritual and carnal. "The world and
          the flesh must be reinstated in their rights, in order that the spirit may no longer have
          to live in the sixth storey, as it does in Germany." And he brings the narration of a very
          lengthy Bohemian legend of Libussa to a close with the jubilant cry: "The free woman is
          sovereign; let her decide, let her speak, for she has the right to speak! And sweet is the
          happiness of free love!"</p>

        <p>Mundt began as a Hegelian, but his Hegelianism has, as we see, turned into a sort of
          fantastic mysticism. Christ declared that his kingdom is not of this world, and yet he
          came to us and himself became world. God, out of love, entered into the flesh, and the
          world's flesh has become holy since it became God. Hence the kingdom of God flourishes
          over the wide earth, and yet it is, as Christ declared, not of this world, that is, not of
          the world which is flesh only, and which sets its face against the free "movement" of
          thought. Like an insufficiently trained pedant, Mundt involves himself in lengthy and
          confused polemics against "the beyond" which is without "the here," and against "the here"
          which refuses to know anything of "the beyond." He ends by enthusiastically proclaiming
          the praises of what he calls "the image" (as distinct from both spiritless matter and
          immaterial spirit): "O ye philosophers! what you want is the image.... I contend for the
          rehabilitation of the image."[4]</p>

        <p>If there ever was a man unsuited to be a leader and teacher of other men, it was this
          unctuous proclaimer of self-evident truths. _Madonna_ was followed by a long series of
          historical novels (a still longer series came from the pen of Mundt's wife, who wrote
          under the pseudonym of Louise Mühlbach), and a considerable number of critical and
          historical writings. Amongst these latter one of the best is his _Geschichte der
          Litteratur der Gegenwart_ ("History of Present Day Literature"), 1842, because in it he
          treats a <pb n="274"/> subject with which he has a thorough acquaintance; but it, too,
          like all his other works, is formless, full of undigested material, and spoiled by
          would-be profundity. He reads, for instance, a special meaning into the fact that Hegel
          died of cholera. Hegel's system, he writes, was, like Casimir Périer's, a universally
          levelling _juste-milieu_ system: hence he, like Casimir Périer, was fated to die of this
          universally levelling malady. It was a malady which must be regarded as the physical
          expression of the general anguish of the times. Troubled and restless, the body had
          attacked its own intestines, and was at last obliged to pay the penalty of its craving to
          know and understand itself, by performing the last possible process of self-examination,
          that of vomiting itself up.[5]</p>

        <p>In a work entitled _Das junge Deutschland_, consisting for the most part of letters to
          the publisher, Feodor Wehl, the well-known theatrical manager, has endeavoured to give the
          reading world a more favourable idea of Mundt than that prevalent in our days; and he has
          succeeded in producing the impression that Mundt was a man with excellent intentions, many
          acquirements, and no small degree of enthusiasm in the causes that were sympathetic to
          him. He is not, and never will be considered, a great writer.</p>

        <p>The authors of the second rank, the rearguard of Young Germany, men like Gustav Kühne,
          Hermann Marggraff, and Alexander Jung, are in reality his equals. Their gifts lie, like
          his, partly in the direction of journalism, partly in that of creative authorship. They
          are men of character, cultivation, and distinct literary ability, animated by the same
          fundamental ideas as the men in the front ranks.</p>

        <p>The reader who takes up Kühne's _Weibliche und männliche Charaktere_ (1838) will be
          agreeably surprised by the vigour and brilliancy of his delineations, and by his accurate
          appreciations of public personages. His heroines are those of his school--Rahel, Bettina,
          Charlotte Stieglitz; but he sees them with his own eyes and describes them with
          unpretentious enthusiasm. Among the poets, who are the subjects of his laudatory
          criticism, are not only the great <pb n="275"/> Radicals of a former generation like
          Shelley, not only all the singers of freedom of his own day, from Anastasius Grün to Karl
          Beck, but tranquil spirits like Rückert and Chamisso. He is not remarkably original, but
          he is impartial and unprejudiced.</p>

        <p>The same can be said of Hermann Marggraff. Though his book _Deutschlands jüngste
          Litteratur- und Culturepoche_ (1839), is written in the spirit of Young Germany, its
          author always reserves his right to perfectly independent judgment. He is a thoughtful,
          earnest critic and a good writer, always natural, at times brilliant. His errors are much
          more due to Conservative tendencies than to excessive modernity.</p>

        <p>Unless we single out the _enfants perdus_ of this new school--and there are such in every
          school--it cannot be said that its members gave any real occasion for the violent attacks
          made upon it. It is not Young Germany, but its assailants, who uniformly show the worst
          taste and exaggerate most grossly.</p>

        <p>Such an assailant was Tieck, now an elderly man. Several of his tales contain thrusts at
          Young Germany; that in which it is satirised most directly is _Der Wassermensch_; but the
          caricature is so overdone that it loses all effect.</p>

        <p>Florheim, the representative of Young Germany, is half crazy with enthusiasm for
          Frenchmen and Jews. He poses as the democrat and friend of freedom in a manner which we
          should consider foolish in an ordinary schoolboy. He maintains that in every concert
          programme the Marseillaise ought to have a place, to keep people from forgetting what is
          the one thing above all others. He would have portraits of the great heroes of liberty,
          Mirabeau, Washington, Franklin, Kosciuszko, &amp;c, inserted in every printed book, even
          in cookery books. In every almanac, if he could have his will, July should be printed in
          red letters, to keep the glorious Revolution of July in ever fresh remembrance. And he
          hopes that all the truly noble will unite in insisting that the nouns, prince, lord, king,
          count, squire, &amp;c, shall be written without capital letters, in order to show contempt
          for their signification.</p>

        <p><pb n="276"/> When the Privy Councillor (Geheimrath), the representative of intelligent
          Conservatism, asks Florheim how he and his ("Sie, die Sie sich das junge Deutschland
          nennen"--you who call yourselves Young Germany) hope to carry out their plans and plots
          against the existing order of things, he answers naïvely: "By perpetual abuse of all that
          stands in our way." And he goes on to show how it was thus they treated Goethe in the last
          years of his age--an assertion which is quite contrary to fact--and how, now that they are
          the "party of movement" and already in possession of the most important newspapers, they
          are in a position to form an invisible and yet open league spread over the whole of
          Germany, which shall ruin every author who is not of their way of thinking, and make the
          reputation of its own members by means of unscrupulous mutual laudations.[6]</p>

        <p>The reality was very different from this. The caricature has the double fault of not
          being like and not being amusing. Mundt took an ingenious revenge some years later by
          suggesting the performance of Tieck's fairy-tale comedies in Berlin.</p>

        <p>RAHEL, BETTINA, CHARLOTTE STIEGLITZ</p>

        <p>The representation of the relation between literature and politics, the history of
          literary events, and the delineation of the characters and work of the most eminent of the
          men who constituted Young Germany, do not sufficiently reveal to us the spirit, the
          psychical condition of the time.</p>

        <p>What is done, and what happens, is its outward manifestation. In books, effect is a first
          consideration; what is represented in them must be to a certain extent exaggerated, thrown
          into relief, if only for the sake of distinctness. To find the clue to the intellectual
          life _lived_ at any given period, we must get as close as possible to the living, feeling,
          individual, and we must not neglect to supplement the impression received from an
          observation of the leading men of the time by a study of its typical women.</p>

        <p>It is where there is more feeling than action, where, in spite of great originality, the
          formative, the fashioning power is too slight entirely to separate the production from the
          personality, that the student comes into closest contact with the life-springs of a
          period. A letter from a highly gifted woman tells us more of the living human being and
          its real emotions than a political speech or a tragedy.</p>

        <p>Not one of the few great women who ruled men's minds during the period under
          consideration produced a work of art; not one of them even attempted to. They neither
          wrote novels nor essays. Their literary influence was a directly personal influence, and
          their power of stirring men's minds was evidently due to the fact that something of the
          inmost essence of the period was expressed in their personalities. Their natures are
          unplastic, evasive; the contours of their spiritual lives are blurred and indistinct; <pb
            n="278"/> this makes it difficult to delineate their characters, but makes it all the
          easier to feel the pulse of the time in their utterances.</p>

        <p>They help us to arrive at the result that the idea which shapes the lives of the most
          noble characters of this period, and which makes itself felt in the resistance they
          offered to the worship of rule and the tyranny of custom, is the idea that the one course
          worthy of a thinking, feeling, human being is independently and unconventionally to
          interpret human life, human relations, for himself, and to base his conduct on his own
          interpretation. This is not a new idea; it originated in Germany with Herder, descended
          from him to all the preachers of the gospel of Nature, including that Heinse who had such
          a strong influence upon some of the leaders of Young Germany, but was more especially
          developed and applied in all the relations of life by Goethe. A careful study of the
          characters of the most remarkable women of the time shows that the subterranean, hidden
          secret of the period between 1810 and 1838, what had happened deepest down, was that
          Goethe's theory of life had, point by point, displaced the Church theory and taken
          possession of all the men of great instincts, of all the really gifted minds of the
          day.</p>

        <p>Rahel Varnhagen von Ense is, beyond all comparison, the greatest of the women who
          occupied the attention of intellectual Germany in the Thirties and Forties. She died in
          March 1833, and in 1835 her husband published the three volumes of selections from her
          letters and journals which revealed to the great reading public what manner of woman she
          had been. This publication was followed by many others, of which she was the main
          theme.</p>

        <p>A less innately great, but much more talented woman than Rahel was Bettina von Arnim,
          who, in 1835, published _Goethe's Briefwechsel mit einem Kinde_ (Goethe's Correspondence
          with a Child), a work which created a great sensation and was most favourably
          received.</p>

        <p>Rahel's name is remembered by the quiet, powerful influence she steadily exercised for so
          many years; Bettina's shines with the lustre of her brilliant talent and sparkling <pb
            n="279"/> wit; the third woman who made a deep impression on the men and women of that
          day is remembered by one action, her suicide. This was Charlotte Stieglitz, who committed
          suicide in December 1834, and whose biography, diaries, and letters were published by
          Theodor Mundt in 1835. She was at once made the subject of studies and panegyrics by the
          new school. Gustav Kühne, in particular, wrote an admirable notice of her. It was her
          death which, as has been already mentioned, suggested Gutzkows _Wally_.</p>

        <p>Rahel Antonie Friederike Varnhagen (family name originally Levin, afterwards Robert) was
          born in Berlin in 1771. She would thus seem to belong to quite another epoch than that of
          the Revolution of July; but it was not until after her death that she became a public
          personage, and entered, by means of her written words, into relations with the literary
          public. She was one of those rare beings whose inexhaustible vigour and freshness of mind
          enable them to understand everything and every one, to sympathise with the most dissimilar
          individuals and tendencies, to penetrate to the core of things; and whose wide and
          untiring sympathy wins for them all their life long the affection and admiration of the
          élite of their time, young and old. Rahel received the same homage from Karl Gutzkow that
          she had received from Schelling and Friedrich Schlegel, from Schleiermacher and Wilhelm
          von Humboldt. She had shown herself a fervid patriot during the war of liberation,
          superintending hospitals in Berlin and Prague; and she was admired by Heinrich Heine, who
          dedicated the Lyric Intermezzo in the _Buch der Lieder_ to her when she was fifty. She,
          who had been the intimate of the famous men of the beginning of the century, the Prince de
          Ligne, Fichte, Prince Louis Ferdinand, Fouqué, and many others, surprised every one by her
          enthusiastic appreciation of Victor Hugo's _Les Orientales_, and the writings of the
          Saint-Simonists. There is something great about such a life, undramatic though it be.</p>

        <p>It gives us a feeling of the many-sidedness of her character to remember the long list of
          persons, differing from each other in every possible way, with whom she <pb n="280"/> was
          on intimate terms. There are depths in her nature which still surprise us, and vaguenesses
          quite incomprehensible to the modern mind. The magic of her nature lay in the spoken word,
          the momentary impression, the opportune utterance: so it is not easy to reconstruct. A
          strong influence emanated from her, yet her real life was introspective; she was a woman
          of distinctly aristocratic instincts and sentiments, and yet so tender hearted that her
          sympathies extended far and wide.</p>

        <p>The daughter of a rich Jewish merchant, as a girl plain-looking and without talent of any
          description, she grows up in her father's house in Berlin at a time when as yet the Jews
          had none of the rights of citizens. At the age of twenty-five she has already become an
          influential member of the best society of the capital, and from the age of thirty till her
          death her house is the intellectual centre of Berlin, and one of the intellectual centres
          of Germany. Her great attraction was her perfect originality and unconventionality. All
          human beings desire and love to see themselves mirrored in the mind of a greater human
          being, all crave for sympathy, all would fain be understood. And those who approached
          Rahel--princes and nobles, diplomats and philosophers, poets and scientists--felt
          instinctively that this young girl with the slight, graceful figure, the beautifully
          formed limbs, the thick, waving hair surrounding a face with an expression of suffering,
          but with a deep, steadfast look in its dark eyes, was worthy of their confidence, and this
          for the one and sufficient reason, that she was innocent of all prejudices.</p>

        <p>She gladly associates with a charming hetæra like Pauline Wiese, Prince Louis Fredinand's
          friend; is her and her cynical husband's and her princely lover's confidante. She has a
          sincere regard for a reactionary sensualist like Friedrich Gentz, warmly congratulates him
          when he, at the age of sixty, wins the affections of Fanny Elsler, sees in him the
          distinguished prose writer and the politician who had been of national importance at a
          critical moment. Human beings are to her, in Goethe's sense, natural products.</p>

        <p>That she, with her strict personal morality and Liberal tendencies, should have been able
          to rise to such a height <pb n="281"/> of freedom from prejudice and gain such a wide
          horizon, was primarily due to her having been born in a sort of sanctuary outside the pale
          of society, that is to say in the house of a wealthy Berlin Jew.</p>

        <p>In intolerant, stiff old Prussia, the alien, despised, hooknosed money-lenders had sat
          behind their counters for some centuries, with no thought for anything but money--piling
          thaler upon thaler, buying bills, and lending money even to princes. With all their wealth
          they were ignorant, orthodox, superstitious. But during the period of enlightenment the
          influence of Moses Mendelssohn thoroughly aroused them. Their piety became a noble
          rationalism, and they comprehended the meaning of knowledge and culture. By the close of
          the eighteenth century they were giving their sons a perfectly new training, and society
          was also beginning to look upon these sons as men to whom reparation for a wrong was
          due.</p>

        <p>It was in the generation of these sons that the Jewish houses all at once opened their
          long closed doors, revealing interiors which in no way resembled the cramped middle-class
          German houses--spacious rooms with rich Oriental carpets and hangings; here and there a
          valuable painting, made over to father or grandfather by some prince in pecuniary
          difficulties; on the dinner tables gold and silver plate, the finest crystal sparkling
          upon lace-edged linen, choice viands, and the rarest wines. The mistress of the house and
          her daughters had received a higher and more refined education than others in their rank
          of life; they were deeply interested in theology, philosophy, and music; they had
          developed quickly under the influence of the mixed society which now frequented their
          house.[1]</p>

        <p>For here, as upon neutral ground, met all those whom society usually separated, members
          of all its different ranks and castes, and many whom it altogether excluded; German and
          foreign actresses had the entrance of no other middle-class houses in Berlin; here they
          were received on the same footing as the other guests. The princes frequented no <pb
            n="282"/> other middle-class houses, if it were for no other reason than that the
          company they met there bored them. To these houses they came, attracted by the easy tone
          and by the wit of the women. It was a refined Bohemia. It was the first development of the
          cosmopolitan spirit in the Berlin of old Prussia.</p>

        <p>It is in these circles that Rahel grows up, early distinguished by her friendship with
          Prince Louis Ferdinand, the hero of the young generation of that day, son of Frederick the
          Great's youngest brother. He was about Rahel's own age, chivalrous, artistic, loose in his
          morals, brave to foolhardiness, a first-rate musician, and a first-rate cavalry general.
          Goethe describes him in his book on the campaign of 1793. Like all the princes of that
          day, he had been educated like a Frenchman, to the extent (as we know from some of his
          published letters) of not being able to spell German correctly; nevertheless he was an
          ardent enemy of Napoleon, and burned to match his troops against the great Emperor's. Like
          the Prince of Homburg in his day, he disobeyed an order to retreat, and, infuriated by the
          defeat at Saalfeld, refusing to flee, refusing to yield, was cut down by the French
          hussars. He confided his wild love adventures to Rahel, and found comfort, when suffering
          from the treachery of a faithless lady love, in tranquil, serious conversation with his
          sisterly friend.</p>

        <p>But Rahel was not always in a position to comfort others. In her young days she stood
          sorely in need of comfort herself. By nature she was of such an irritably nervous
          temperament that as a child she was with difficulty kept in life: "Let the air be too
          dense or too rare, too warm or too cold, and I am ill at once. And the slightest
          excitement has a still worse effect. I cannot imagine any one more sensitive." In nearly
          all her letters, immediately after the date, we find a detailed description of the weather
          and temperature: "Friday, 14th March, 1828.--A grey day, with south-west wind, damp and
          yet spring-like, though not inviting for a walk. Pigeons are flying. Every now and then a
          blue window appears in the sky; at this moment sunlight is coming through one of them."
          "23rd March, <pb n="283"/> 1829.--The sun has broken through the clouds and is shining
          brightly; a cold, sharp, unmistakable north-east wind; impossible to go to the
          Thiergarten, where there is still ice and it is as cold as in a cellar." "17th
          April,--Noon; spring weather after rain; the trees turning green. To me the best time of
          the whole year--no flies or mosquitoes, no heat. Spring is approaching, wafting to us a
          thousand memories, and a thousand hopes which can never be fulfilled, but which are a
          necessity to us."</p>

        <p>Such natures deserve and arouse as much compassion as admiration. Her friend, W. von
          Burgsdorf, writes to her: "When I saw you for the first time, it struck me at once that
          you must have been educated by long suffering." It was true; she had had an infirm body, a
          melancholy youth, a severe father, and had early suffered humiliation. Her Jewish birth
          was the cause of great unhappiness to her--an unhappiness almost unworthy of her; she
          calls it a sword thrust into her heart by a supernatural being at the moment of her birth.
          Not one fibre in her nature attached her to the religious community to which by birth she
          belonged. The memory of its fanaticism and of the fanatical enmity displayed towards it
          was still fresh. As lately as 1756 the Jewish community in Berlin had expelled a child
          from the town for having carried a book for a Christian. And on the other side, even Moses
          Mendelssohn could not go out with his children without having stones thrown at them.</p>

        <p>With all the power of his intellect and will, Rahel's father had striven to overcome the
          sickly child's independence of character, and only her unusual elasticity and strength of
          mind enabled her to preserve her originality. When young she felt as if she had suffered
          so much there could not possibly be anything left in her to be bent or broken.</p>

        <p>It was inevitable that a woman with this passionate nature should love passionately and
          should suffer agony through her love. And she did not escape her fate. Twice, when she
          loved most ardently, she experienced as it were the feeling of being struck down with an
          assassin's knife and of living for years with the knife in the wound.</p>

        <p><pb n="284"/> At the age of twenty-four she formed a very strong attachment to Count Karl
          von Finckenstein, the son of a Prussian minister, a man a year younger than herself. They
          became engaged, and Rahel lived for some years solely for this love. Finckenstein was
          good-hearted, very much in love, and sincerely devoted to her, but his character was weak.
          He told her what he had to bear from his family, whose pride revolted against an alliance
          with a person of inferior position, and who were endeavouring to make him give her up.
          Rahel's pride was deeply wounded, and she gave him back his word. In character and
          intellect his superior, she could easily have vanquished his scruples if she had made up
          her mind to do so, but instead of this she set him free at once, and he was weak enough,
          attached though he was to her, to take the liberty she offered. She never overcame this
          first great humiliation.</p>

        <p>Three years passed, and she fell in love again, this time passionately, soul and senses,
          and the feeling was returned. Her second engagement was to Don Raphael Urquijo, a
          particularly attractive young attaché of the Spanish embassy in Berlin. The engagement
          lasted for a year. They were passionately attached to each other, but their characters
          were too unlike, he was too decidedly her inferior. He tormented and insulted her with his
          jealousy to such an extent that to preserve her self-respect she parted from him; but she
          did it with a feeling of crushing, maddening grief, a feeling of loneliness, of being left
          exposed to all the coldness of life without that shelter from it which she, with her
          woman's heart, could so ill dispense with.</p>

        <p>After Finckenstein's desertion, it had been proposed that she should make a _mariage de
          convenance_. Her answer was: "I cannot marry, for I cannot lie. Do not imagine that I am
          proud of myself for this; I cannot do it, just as I cannot play the flute.... He must have
          no prejudices, otherwise I could not stand it.... And he must not be stupid and compel me
          to lie and pretend that I admire him. I must be able to say exactly what I choose."</p>

        <p>For long the needs of her heart were only incompletely satisfied, and she applied herself
          all the more ardently to <pb n="285"/> intellectual pursuits. It was a great hindrance to
          her that she had acquired so little knowledge. She herself talked about her dense
          ignorance. She was, of course, very far from being ignorant, but so much is certain, that
          she never acquired any real insight into what science is, and never thought a scientific
          thought.</p>

        <p>She had been taught as little Jewish dogma as history and geography. She says that she
          grew up like a tree in the forest, and that it was as impossible for her to learn religion
          as anything else. So she evolved a religion of her own, which, as Karl Hillebrand
          correctly observes, has something akin with Schopenhauer's doctrine; her ideas of a will
          in nature, of the misery of the world, of compassion as the only source of morality, are
          akin to his. She was a great admirer of Angelus Silesius and Saint-Martin; like Goethe she
          was an ardent Pantheist, She copies the German mystic's lines:</p>

        <p> "Alle Tugenden sind eine Tugend. Schau, alle Tugenden sind ein ohn' Unterschied. Willst
          du den Namen hör'n? Sie heisst Gerechtigkeit,"[2]</p>

        <p>and writes beneath them:</p>

        <p>"Weil sie Wahrheit ist Einfachheit, Unparteilichkeit, Selbstlosigkeit, Austheilung für
          Alle."[3]</p>

        <p>She saw everything in its unity, its entirety. There was something of the Delphic
          priestess in her nature. It is a pity that her words, disconnected from her personality as
          we have them, are so often dark oracular sayings.</p>

        <p>She was, says Karl Hillebrand, full of leniency towards the culpable, of sympathy with
          the slighted and humble, of compassion for the poor; the one thing she despised was
          correct mediocrity, and her contempt for this she displayed openly, even when by so doing
          she made enemies.</p>

        <p>Time passed, and she grew into the old maid; but years made no change in her appearance
          and did not diminish <pb n="286"/> her wonderful power. For ten years she carried on a
          tender correspondence with her future husband, Varnhagen von Ense. He was fourteen years
          younger than herself, was first a brave officer, then a clever diplomatist, and finally an
          excellent, very aggressive writer; he had to distinguish himself in both war and peace
          before he could appear in the character of her fiancé without being entirely overlooked.
          She married him when she was forty-two, and had a perfectly happy married life for
          nineteen years.</p>

        <p>Rahel owes her literary distinction to the fact that she was the first in the literary
          circles of Berlin to comprehend and to proclaim Goethe's real greatness. Long before any
          decisive opinion on this vital question in German culture had been arrived at, Rahel,
          fully persuaded of Goethe's genius, completely under the spell of its power, proclaimed to
          all with whom she came into contact that this man was not to be compared with other men;
          that he stood alone--the loftiest intellect, the wisest counsellor and judge in all the
          affairs of life. This was at a time when Goethe as an author was only one among the crowd,
          and when others were ranked high above him. Long before the criticism of the brothers
          Schlegel established his position beyond dispute, Rahel had introduced the cult of the
          great, uncomprehended, misjudged genius in her circle in Berlin, had everywhere proclaimed
          the praises of his illuminating word, and declared his name to be a holy, a consecrated
          name.</p>

        <p>In 1795, when she is only twenty-four, she is so fortunate as to meet him at Teplitz. We
          learn from a letter from David Veit to Rahel, what Goethe said about her: "Yes, that now
          is a girl of remarkable intellect, a girl who is always thinking--and as to feeling--where
          is the like of her to be found? We were constantly together, and were on the most
          friendly, intimate terms." To Franz Horn, Goethe said: "She is a girl with a loving heart;
          she feels everything very strongly, and yet expresses herself very gently--we admire the
          originality and are charmed by the amiability."</p>

        <p>When Rahel is told this, she writes: "How can he know that I have feeling? Never in my
          life was it so difficult for <pb n="287"/> me to show myself as I am. But why write thus?
          He is Goethe. And what he feels and says is true. I believe what he says of me.... When
          you see him, Horn, greet him from one who has always worshipped him, idolised him, even
          when no one else praised, understood, admired him. And if he wonders at a staid young
          woman sending him such a greeting, make him understand that her excessive reverence for
          him prevented her telling him how she reveres him. Tell him that this is not affectation,
          but true, tender feeling (_Pflaumenweichheit_). It is not my fault that others affect what
          in my case is serious earnest. Am I not right? Yes, yes! I worship him."</p>

        <p>Nothing further happens; there is not the slightest attempt on Rahel's part to keep up
          the acquaintance with Goethe, by correspondence, or any other means. She never mentions
          his person, only his genius. Twenty years pass, during which she sees nothing of him.
          Once, in 1811, Varnhagen sends Goethe some appreciations of his poetry written by Rahel.
          Goethe is much struck by them, pronounces the author to have a remarkable gift of
          instantaneously grasping, comprehending, connecting, helping, completing; but he never
          learns--Rahel having forbidden Varnhagen to tell--who the author of the manuscript is. In
          1815, in the neighbourhood of Frankfort, Rahel sees Goethe again. There is something
          touching about this meeting. Goethe is now sixty-six. He is visiting his friend, Marianne
          von Willemer (the Suleika of the _Diwan_) at Willemer's country house "die Gerbermühle."
          Rahel, who is in Frankfort, accidentally sees him driving with his hosts, and in her
          sudden joyful surprise calls loudly: "There is Goethe."</p>

        <p>Twenty years, as already mentioned, have passed. It is a quarter past nine on the morning
          of the 8th of September. Rahel, who had been suffering from an affection of the eyes, has
          got up later than usual, and is standing half-dressed, brushing her teeth, when the
          landlord comes to say that a gentleman wishes to see her. Her maid hands her his card. It
          is Goethe. And out of pure respect, that he may not have to wait, she does not take time
          to dress herself properly, <pb n="288"/> to make herself look presentable: "I told them to
          ask him to walk into the sitting-room, and only kept him waiting the time that it took me
          to put on a dressing-gown (_Unterrock_). It was a black quilted dressing-gown. I
          sacrificed myself so as not to keep him waiting one minute. It was my one thought. I did
          not even excuse my dress; I did nothing but thank him. I did not excuse myself, for it
          seemed to me that he must know that _I_ obliterated myself, that _he_ was my one
          consideration. Such was--alas!--the first impulse of my heart. Now, with the most
          passionate, most comical, most torturing remorse, I think otherwise."</p>

        <p>The feeling of being unsuitably, unbecomingly dressed, depressed her; she said nothing
          that was worthy of her. After all these years of love for him, of living in him, and
          longing for him, she saw him once and once only in private for a few minutes, and this was
          the turn things took. "But you must hear to the end how ridiculous I was," she writes to
          Varnhagen. "When he had gone I dressed most carefully and beautifully. I wanted to make up
          for everything. I put on a lovely white dress with a high collar, a lace veil, my Moscow
          shawl.... Now I can say as Prince Louis wrote: 'My market value has risen ten thousand
          thalers. Goethe has visited me.'"</p>

        <p>Rahel, after twenty years of waiting, after the worship of a lifetime, receiving Goethe
          in a quilted dressing-gown rather than keep him waiting ten minutes--this every one will
          confess to be a supreme expression of feminine heroism. After the perusal of many volumes
          of Rahel literature, this scene is what remains in one's mind as definitely characterising
          her. It gives the measure of her reverence, her understanding, and her capability of
          overcoming even the most justifiable vanity of her sex.</p>

        <p>It is to be regretted that a being with such rare attributes should have been entirely
          destitute of talent, of all creative, plastic power. Her ingenious and profound thoughts
          are scattered, as mere observations, throughout private letters and records which
          otherwise are of little interest to us nowadays. Probably none but enthusiastic devotees
          of the women's rights theories are capable of reading much of her at a time.</p>

        <p><pb n="289"/> Her nature was not the artistic nature. Its essence was truthfulness. She
          herself says: "In the great universal misery of this world, I have consecrated myself to
          one God, truth; and every time I have been saved, it has been by him." She was a staunch,
          reliable friend, yet, even at the risk of sinking in the estimation of others, she frankly
          and without shame confessed when the feeling of friendship had ceased to exist. Closely
          connected with her truthfulness was her simplicity; she made no pretence of being above
          common weaknesses, no secret of her love of sweets and her keen interest in the latest
          Paris fashions. And she was fortunate enough to feel what she deserved to feel, an
          undisturbed inward harmony, partly innate, partly acquired, a perfect consistency of her
          spiritual life with her convictions. This was what gave her her great and justifiable
          self-confidence. "Pedantry cannot exist within thirty miles of where I am," she used to
          say.</p>

        <p>We have seen how great her moral tolerance was; in intellectual matters she was equally
          forbearing. She neither demanded moral purity nor marked ability in those she esteemed;
          what she did demand was unaffectedness. She was unique in her keen recognition and
          appreciation of whatever was natural and original, however unassuming; and she herself, in
          spite of her searching intellect, was as naïve and fresh in perception and expression as a
          gifted child.</p>

        <p>When she was at the zenith of her reputation she was obliged to make herself
          unapproachable, to surround herself with all sorts of social barricades, that she might be
          free to choose her associates. She invariably chose individuals of markedly original
          character.</p>

        <p>One of her intimates, Count Tilly, writes to her: "I have a thousand polite messages to
          give you before I close. One person admires you; a second is devoted to you; a third is
          astonished by your words of wisdom; a fourth is grieved to say farewell to you, even when
          it is only a letter that must be brought to a close. It is I, myself, who am all these
          different persons." This little pleasantry serves to give us an idea of the varied
          impressions she produced.</p>

        <p><pb n="290"/> Rahel often reflected on the subject of originality. She writes: "If a
          person were to say, 'You imagine it is easy to be original--on the contrary, it costs no
          end of trouble and exertion,' he would be thought crazy. And yet the assertion would be a
          true one. Every one could be original, if only people did not carelessly cram their heads
          with half-digested maxims, which they pour forth again as carelessly."</p>

        <p>There had been eminent and interesting women in German intellectual society before Rahel.
          The latest were Caroline, Dorothea, and those others known to fame through the
          Romanticists. Rahel is the first great modern German woman, and the first to be completely
          conscious of her originality.[4]</p>

        <p>The pursuit of originality in her day was not without its accompanying danger. It is not
          the danger of affectation that I allude to. In all days and times there have been affected
          creatures who imagine that they are original when they help themselves to soup with their
          shoes. But the perpetual self-inspection and self-examination prevalent in Rahel's day
          produced a dangerous tendency to impute singularity to very ordinary feelings and
          impressions, a liability to become unaffectedly unnatural, like the beautiful Henriette
          Herz and many of her friends, whose outpourings have a haunting flavour of lamp-oil and
          ink. The fire-writing of originality is something very different.</p>

        <p>This is to be found in Bettina's _Goethe's Correspondence with a Child_. Bettina's
          letters are written in the fiery characters, the "singing flames" of passion.</p>

        <p>Bettina von Arnim, a sister of Clemens Brentano, wife of Achim von Arnim, by family and
          marriage connected with the Romanticists, nevertheless belongs as an authoress to the
          Young German school. Rahel admired and worshipped Goethe timidly, with a beating heart, a
          quiet, dignified seriousness. Bettina's admiration showed itself in an insinuating,
          half-sensuous, half-intellectual devotion, a determined bur-like adhesiveness, and flights
          of the wildest enthusiasm.</p>

        <p><pb n="291"/> In 1807, when she, as a native of the same town, made Goethe's acquaintance
          through his mother, she must have been twenty-three, but in her ways she was still a
          child, or rather a being midway between child and woman. She comes to Weimar, provides
          herself with a superfluous letter of introduction from Wieland, holds out both her hands
          to Goethe as soon as she sees him, and forgets herself altogether. He leads her to the
          sofa, seats himself beside her, talks about the Duchess Amalie's death, asks if she has
          read about it in the newspaper. "I never read newspapers," said I. "Indeed! I understood
          that you were interested in all that goes on at Weimar." "No, I am only interested in you,
          and I'm far too impatient to be a newspaper reader." "You are a kind, friendly girl." A
          long pause. She jumps up from the sofa and throws her arms round his neck.</p>

        <p>This little anecdote suffices to show the difference between her position to Goethe and
          Rahel's. From her childhood she had been distinguished by a youthful daring more often met
          with in boys than girls. At Marburg they still show a tower to the top of which she
          climbed, drawing the ladder up after her, so that she might be alone. Along with the
          agility of a young acrobat, she had something of Mignon's childlike, innocent devotion.
          She is Mignon in real life, as charming as ever, and far less serious.</p>

        <p>In 1835, when her _Goethe's Briefwechsel mit einem Kinde_ came out, Bettina was fifty.
          Arnim had died in 1831, Goethe in 1832. She had got back the letters written by herself to
          Goethe between 1808 and 1811, when an end was put to their intercourse by an act of
          discourtesy on her part towards Frau Goethe, and had taken even greater liberties with
          these letters than Goethe took in _Dichtung und Wahrheit_ with the experience of his past
          life. She expressed in them not only all that she had felt, but much that she now thought
          she ought to have felt; she gave to their intercourse a more passionate colouring than
          really belonged to it, and yet in the profoundest sense she was truthful. The letters were
          at first accepted as genuine. But strong suspicions were presently awakened by the fact of
          Bettina's having published poems, which were undoubtedly addressed <pb n="292"/> to other
          women, as if they had been written to her; and there came a time when her letters lost all
          credit as historic documents, and everything in them was considered to be fictitious. In
          1879, however, Loeper published the genuine letters written by Goethe to Bettina, and it
          was then seen that in them she had made almost no alteration; a few greetings were omitted
          and _thou_ was substituted for _you_--nothing more. In only one of the original letters is
          she addressed as _thou_, but that letter is the only one which Goethe did not dictate, but
          wrote with his own hand, so Bettina's alteration was not altogether unjustifiable. Goethe
          was in the habit of enclosing in his letters any poem which he had just written. Bettina
          was conceited enough to imagine that poems addressed to Minna Herzlieb (even those which
          played upon the name Herzlieb, and were consequently incomprehensible to her) and to
          Marianne von Willemer, were meant for her. This was an absurd but excusable mistake. It
          was inexcusable of her to transpose these poems into prose and incorporate them in her
          earlier letters, thereby producing the impression that Goethe had simply put her thoughts
          and feelings into verse.</p>

        <p>What she tells us of her intercourse with Goethe's mother, of her eagerness to gather
          from that mothers lips information about Goethe's childhood which might serve as an
          introduction to _Dichtung und Wahrheit_, and also what she tells about Beethoven and the
          relation in which she stood to him, is in all essentials absolutely true.[5]</p>

        <p>No one with any feeling for poetic enthusiasm who has read Bettina's book in his youth
          will ever forget the first impression produced by her style. There is a vitality about it,
          an animation, a refined wildness, a rhythmic ring and flow, which astound and fascinate.
          Turning from Rand's dark hieroglyphs, which suggest a thousand secrets to us, but which we
          seldom really understand, because the living life which was the commentary is no more, it
          is refreshing to bathe in this clear spring of naïve and charming devotion. Rahel is more
          profound and more realistic. But talent is <pb n="293"/> such a marvellous thing. The
          pleasure it gives is great. We can and must excuse much for its sake.</p>

        <p>In these letters Bettina is twenty-three to twenty-five years old, Goethe fifty-eight to
          sixty. Hence her passion is not the ordinary human passion of a young woman for a young
          man. She has grown up with it; it is an inheritance from her mother, Maxe Brentano, who
          partly suggested Werther's Charlotte. She loves Goethe's mother, as a young woman always
          does love the mother of her beloved; she is grateful to her for having borne him--"how
          else should I have known him!" Her devotion to the son finds expression in letters to the
          mother, till she meets him; then she writes to himself.</p>

        <p>After that first embrace she looks upon him as her own. She writes to his mother: "It is
          possible to acquire a kind of possession of a man which no one can dispute. This I have
          done with Wolfgang. And it is what no one ever did before, in spite of all these love
          affairs you have told me about. Love is the key of the universe; through it the spirit
          learns to comprehend and to feel everything. How else could it learn!"</p>

        <p>These letters have been compared to ships laden with rich cargoes. Goethe is the guiding
          star on all their voyages.</p>

        <p>All her thoughts of him are thoughts of enthusiastic devotion: "I would I were sitting at
          his door like some poor beggar child, so that he might come out to give me a piece of
          bread. He would read in my eyes what I am, would take me into his arms and wrap his cloak
          round me to warm me. I know he would not tell me to go again; I should have my place in
          his house; years would pass, and no one would know where I was; years would pass and life
          would pass; I should see the whole world mirrored in his face, and more I should not need
          to learn."</p>

        <p>"Last May, when I saw him for the first time, he picked a young leaf from the vine at his
          window and held it against my cheek and said: 'Which is softer, the leaf or your cheek?' I
          was sitting on a stool at his feet. How often I have thought of that leaf, and of how he
          stroked my <pb n="294"/> forehead and my face with it, and played with my hair, and said:
          'I am a simple-minded man; it is easy to deceive me; there would be no glory in doing it.'
          There was nothing brilliant in these words, but I have lived that scene over again a
          thousand times in my thoughts; I shall drink it in all my life, as the eye drinks
          light--it was not intellectual converse, no! but to me it surpasses all the wisdom of the
          world."</p>

        <p>There is poetry in this exaltation and in the way in which she tells of his constant
          presence with her, of her longing for him, of her dumb jealousy of the famous women who
          came, as Madame de Staël did, to make his acquaintance; there is poetry in her distress at
          her inability to be of any use to him, and in her vivid appreciation of her own
          capacity.</p>

        <p>"I must tell you what I dreamt about you last night. I often have the same dream. I am
          going to dance for you. I have the feeling that my dance will be a success. A crowd has
          gathered round me. I look for you, and see you sitting alone, straight opposite to me; but
          you don't seem to see me. With golden shoes on my feet, my shining silver arms hanging
          listlessly by my side, I step forward in front of you, and wait. You lift your head, your
          eyes involuntarily rest upon me; with light steps I begin to trace magic circles, and you
          keep your eyes upon me. You follow me through all my bends and turns; I feel the triumph
          of success. All that you dimly feel I show you in my dance; you marvel at the wisdom it
          reveals. Presently I fling aside my airy mantle, and let you see my wings, and away I fly,
          up to the heights. It rejoices me that your eyes follow me, and I float down again and
          sink into your open arms."</p>

        <p>This symbolic description is both graceful and felicitous. In Bettina's Goethe-worship
          there is something of the same love of mounting and climbing that she displayed in her
          childhood. She climbed up on to the shoulder of the great Olympian's statue--a statue she
          was perpetually modelling--drew the ladder up after her, and sat there alone, revelling in
          the pleasure of being so near him. But it was not her Goethe-worship merely as such which
          made Bettina an <pb n="295"/> ideal character, a Valkyrie, in the eyes of Young Germany.
          What won their hearts was the political liberalism to which she gave expression in her
          letters, and with which she in vain tried to imbue the sage who sat aloof in Weimar, her
          ardent admiration for the brave resistance of the Tyrolese to the domination of France,
          her eager desire for the well-being of humanity, for the extermination of poverty and all
          the other ills of society. It made a powerful impression when she, a worshipper of Goethe,
          but a more independent-minded one than Rahel, extolled Beethoven's republicanism as
          greater, worthier than Goethe's submissive loyalty. She tries to bring Goethe and
          Beethoven together; she wishes she could send Wilhelm Meister to the Tyrol, to Andreas
          Hofer, that he might learn to feel greater enthusiasm and to do manly deeds.</p>

        <p>In the commencement of Frederick William's reign she was in favour at court. There was a
          frank, friendly intimacy between her and the king; she had almost as much influence upon
          him as Humboldt, when there was any question of assisting talent or alleviating misery.
          But before long her feelings led her openly to declare socialistic principles. In 1843 she
          published _Dies Buch gehört dem König_ ("This Book belongs to the King"), a work in which
          she calls upon Frederick William to relieve the distress of his subjects. From her youth
          she had looked upon herself as the natural champion and advocate of the distressed. "The
          forsaken and unhappy possessed a magnetic attraction for her," says Hermann Grimm, who, as
          her son-in-law, knew her intimately. Her natural inclination to help others, arid the
          early impressions made on her mind by the French Revolution, produced those political
          sympathies to which she unhesitatingly gave utterance, in the naïve expectation of
          receiving support from royalty.</p>

        <p>In 1831, when the cholera raged in Berlin, she went fearlessly among the sick and
          suffering. Judging from the hard lot of the Berlin working classes, she came to the
          conclusion that the whole nation was in a bad way and in need of help. To her, liberty had
          always been a magic word. She believed that whenever the words "Let there be light!" <pb
            n="296"/> resounded from the right quarter, liberty would manifest itself, and all the
          feelings and dreams of humanity would take shape in harmonious music, to the strains of
          which the peoples would march joyfully onwards.</p>

        <p>Her book, which in a little introductory parable she dedicates to the king, is written in
          the form of conversations. Goethe's mother is the chief speaker. There is much warm
          feeling in the book, and a considerable amount of information on the subject of the
          distress among the lower classes, but too little political insight to make it readable
          nowadays.</p>

        <p>The authoress reaches a climax with the words: "Our sign is the banner of liberty; its
          brightness lights up the black darkness of the times; its brilliancy dazzles and terrifies
          those who are on the shore, but we are glad and rejoice.... Dangers? Liberty knows no
          dangers! To it everything is possible. The storm itself, the wildest of all storms, is the
          captain of our ship."[6]</p>

        <p>Such sentiments were not likely to meet with a favourable reception at the Prussian court
          of that day. The book created a sensation, but put an end to the good understanding
          between Bettina and the king. It naturally only increased the political discontent of the
          masses, and a pretext was found for seizing her next book (on Clemens Brentano), because a
          repetition of the same sort of thing was feared.</p>

        <p>Long before this, however, Bettina had received the unanimous homage of the younger
          generation. Those interested should read Gutzkow's account of his first visit to her,
          Mundt's description of her, Kühne's poetical appreciation. Even Robert Prutz, severe as he
          is on all the representatives and models of Young Germany, numbers himself among her
          admirers. "Bettina's letters are," he says, "the last bright blaze of Romanticism, the
          sparkling, crackling fireworks with which it closes its great festival; but they are at
          the same time the funeral pile upon which it consumes itself, the pillar of fire which
          rises from its ashes--and shows us the way."</p>

        <p>The third woman whose life and character made a deep <pb n="297"/> impression on the
          generation of 1830 was Charlotte Stieglitz, the daughter of a Leipzig merchant named
          Willhöft. As a child Charlotte was quiet and thoughtful, as a young girl there was
          something nun-like about her. In 1822 Heinrich Stieglitz, then in his twenty-first year,
          came to Leipzig to study philology. From no fault of his own he had been mixed up in the
          prosecution of the demagogues in Göttingen. He was a handsome young fellow, audacious,
          and, to judge by his looks, passionate; and he was a poet. Charlotte was then a beautiful
          girl of sixteen, whose appearance suggested the possession of that supernatural quality
          which the Germans in olden days ascribed to those women whom they believed to possess the
          gift of prophecy. She had a high, open, intellectual forehead, curly brown hair piled up
          in a tower-like coiffure, a thin, aquiline nose, a beautiful mouth, large, star-like brown
          eyes that looked brightly and bravely out into the world. She spoke low, but sang with a
          full, clear voice.</p>

        <p>Whatever else modern poets may have neglected, they have not neglected to impress upon
          all, but more especially upon women, that a poet is a superior being. When Charlotte fell
          in love with the handsome young Stieglitz, who was fascinated by her, she felt that she
          had learned what happiness is. The very idea of being the beloved of a poet, a real,
          living poet, was bliss. And to this poet of hers she consecrated her every feeling, her
          every thought, from the first time she saw him until, twelve years later, she stabbed
          herself to the heart for his sake. Even before they were engaged, the desire was ever
          present with her to be able, all unknown to him, to do something really difficult, really
          great for him. She had the feminine helpfulness, the motherliness, the housewifely
          understanding, and the brave cheerfulness which are among a woman's best qualities. The
          impression she produced was that of gentle high-mindedness.</p>

        <p>And this noble woman was unfortunate enough to mistake an effeminate Leipzig student for
          the ideal man of her day-dreams--a poet of inferior, perfectly mediocre talent, for a
          great artist. In order to be able to marry, Stieglitz was <pb n="298"/> obliged to find
          employment. In 1827 he became a teacher in the Berlin Gymnasium and at the same time
          assistant librarian in the Royal Library, groaning immoderately over the restraint imposed
          on him by these occupations. He was gloomy, passionate, eager to distinguish himself as a
          poet, but any artistic gift he had was purely bookish and unrealistic; he had no
          perseverance or power of resistance in the struggle of life, but was one of those whom
          adversity prostrates. He had the outward appearance of a genius; in reality he was but a
          dull fellow.</p>

        <p>It was a tragic misunderstanding on Charlotte's part. She believes that he has an
          untamable, uncontrollable temperament. "You need not deny it," she writes; "you ought to
          have been a brigand-chief." And she calls him her dark, wild, poniard-wielder with the
          flashing eyes. During their long engagement they live in different towns. His letters are
          genial, natural, and affectionate; but one feels in them that he is not unhappy away from
          her. She, more warmblooded, pines for him, for his personal presence. Hers was the
          uncontrollable temperament--he was the genuine bookman, as unlike a robber-chief as any
          librarian on the face of the earth. About the same time as Victor Hugo in France, he feels
          the poetical attraction of the East, and, sitting in his library, makes as careful a study
          as he can of Oriental literature and civilisation. From this study result the _Bilder des
          Orients_, three volumes produced with much toil and trouble. There is a great deal of
          pretty and graphic writing in them, and it was unjust that they were so entirely
          overlooked; but the feeling which animates these Turkish and Persian poems, these Stamboul
          tragedies and scenes from Ispahan, these more than passable verses on the Greek war of
          liberation, is too commonplace, too tame; the marked individuality, the savagery which
          Charlotte saw in Heinrich Stieglitz is exactly what is wanting in them. It is all too
          literary.</p>

        <p>Shortly before their marriage in 1828, Charlotte, at her _fiancé's_ request, bought a
          poniard for him to wear on their wedding tour, the weapon with which, six years later, she
          took her own life. It was but a short time of unmixed <pb n="299"/> happiness that she
          enjoyed after their marriage. But she completely identifies herself with her husband, and
          is miserable because he, the genius, is compelled to spend so much of his time and energy
          on his library work and teaching. She devotes much of hers to writing letters to their
          rich relations in Russia, who are ministers and privy-councillors, and to other patrons
          and friends, in the hope of improving his position. She encourages him indefatigably; she
          knows every one of his poems by heart, parodies one of them with affectionate playfulness.
          A certain scene in his tragedy, _Selim III._, is costing him much time and trouble. One
          day when he comes home, she leads him smilingly to his desk, where he finds it lying,
          completed--the fine scene between the Sultan's mother and the physician in the Third
          Act.</p>

        <p>From time to time there came over her what she calls her champagne-mood; she grieves that
          this is no longer the case with him. She writes a poem to him, with a present of six
          quills, exhorting him to be energetic and determined, and not to reflect too long before
          he begins:</p>

        <p> "Giess ein Füllhorn aus mit Früchten, Blüth und Früchte gieb zugleich, Weisheit sei in
          deinem Dichten, Witz und Jugend mach' es reich.</p>

        <p> Menschen lass uns drinnen finden, Menschen die gelebt, gedacht, Lass von Lieb' dich warm
          entzünden Und von Zorns Gewitternacht."[7]</p>

        <p>She firmly believes in the existence of mighty Titanic thoughts and imaginations in his
          soul, which it is difficult for him to persuade his lips to utter. Alas! he is not only
          uncommunicative, he is barren, and on the verge of insanity, at times possibly over the
          verge. He listens to her exhortations with indifference. She writes: "O Heinrich, for
          God's sake let us be inconsistent at times, let us blaze up wildly, despair madly, rise to
          the bliss of heaven, sink to the depths <pb n="300"/> of hell--anything but be stolidly
          indifferent!" We feel the spiritual kinswoman, the admirer of Rahel, in these words.</p>

        <p>Harassed by the drudgery of his daily life, troubled by the sterility of his overrated
          talent, he was sometimes irritable, sometimes gloomily stolid. She tries every means to
          brace him. At one time she fancies that he is too lonely, that he requires the stimulation
          of more female society--and she is not jealous. She writes (October 1834): "I wish,
          Heinrich, that you could have more intercourse, either personal or by correspondence, with
          clever, womanly women. They are the poet's true public. It would be of interest to you to
          learn, frankly and truthfully, what they think of you and your works. Such intercourse
          would be both instructive and refreshing, a useful and agreeable diversion for you."</p>

        <p>She is determined that they are to travel, to go far afield. He throws up his
          appointments and they go off to St. Petersburg and Finland. But it is all in vain.</p>

        <p>As she and Stieglitz stood looking at the waterfall of Imatra in Finland, in July 1833,
          she spoke the following memorable words: "Is not this like a great thought which has
          strayed into these mountain solitudes? Feelings like mighty billows, thunderstorms, a
          hurricane, would be a suitable accompaniment to this tumbling, foaming water. How poor the
          song about the little violet would sound here, pretty as it is in itself! Like the mighty
          waterfall, this foaming, wildly excited time cries for mighty song. You will give what it
          demands...."</p>

        <p>In October 1835, when he was making perpetual complaint of the small pin-pricks of life,
          she said to him (as he himself has noted): "My careful observation of you has led me to
          the conclusion that whoever wishes to do you real service must provide a real, great
          sorrow for you. Nothing would do you so much good as that; nothing would so surely bring
          out your powers."</p>

        <p>Like most people whose minds are affected, Stieglitz had periods of violent excitement,
          after which he relapsed into his ordinary state of silent, almost animal-like brooding.
          Once when they were on a walking tour, he was so lost in <pb n="301"/> his own thoughts,
          so indifferent to all else, that she left him and went off by herself, hoping that this
          would rouse him; but he did not even notice it. It was a kind of warning that her _final_
          desertion of him would be of no avail; but it was a warning that she did not
          understand.</p>

        <p>Entirely possessed by the latest ideas of the day, persuaded that a poet ought to live in
          the world, to influence and be influenced by it, it was her constant desire to drive him
          to action. She said to him one day: "I long for your spiritual regeneration. You will be
          born again! I know you will! Would that I could hasten that birth--even if it were by
          artificial means! But how if my surgical operation miscarried!" And in December 1834 she
          writes in her diary that Goethe's life becomes fuller from the moment that Schiller enters
          into it, but that Goethe ought to have profited more by his friend's death, and would have
          done so, if he had not, according to his custom, determinedly refused to sorrow; if he had
          allowed the sorrow to enter into him, to become part of himself, the result would have
          been a renewal of youth as far as his poetical productivity was concerned.</p>

        <p>It was in this same month of December, 1834, that Stieglitz's disgust with life reached a
          sort of climax. His malady took the form of intellectual stagnation, of absolute
          incapacity to express himself. Charlotte begged him, as if he had been a child, rather to
          rave and storm as of old than to collapse in this terrible manner; but she begged in vain.
          It was then that she determined to employ the last means in her power, to take that step
          which she, with her innocent, high-flown ideas, felt it obligatory to take, in order that
          a great, simple sorrow might enter into his life, reawaken his genius, and give his poetry
          new themes.</p>

        <p>On the evening of the 29th she came home, knowing that she would have two hours to
          herself, threw her short fur cape and boa on the hall floor, hurried into her bedroom,
          locked the door of communication with the kitchen, undressed, washed herself, put on a
          clean night-dress, wrote a few lines to Heinrich expressing her belief that new life for
          him would arise out of this misfortune, and exhorting him <pb n="302"/> no longer to be
          weak, but calm and strong and great. Then she lay down on the bed and with a firm hand
          plunged the dagger of their wedding tour into her heart.</p>

        <p> * * * * *</p>

        <p>One's first impression is that these women, Rahel, Bettina, and Charlotte, who all three
          became famous in the year 1835, have nothing in common. Rahel dies in 1833 at the age of
          sixty-one, and her real life-work, the first energetic vindication of Goethe's
          pre-eminence, belongs quite as much to the eighteenth as to the nineteenth century.
          Bettina, who is fourteen years younger, does not come before the public till a year after
          Rahel's death; she combines the exalted enthusiasm and the unreality of Romanticism with
          the reforming tendencies of Young Germany. Charlotte's only achievement was to kill
          herself, a thing which has been done by women times without number, though probably never
          for the same reason.</p>

        <p>But when we look a little deeper, we find that they have many traits in common. They are
          all restless, with the restlessness distinctive of their day, which manifests itself, not
          in outward hurry and strain, but in strong emotions, not in the nervousness prevalent in
          our own day, but in perpetual introspection. Then there is the peculiarity that none of
          them transgress the laws of society, though none of them have any respect for these laws.
          And there is the wonderful, ideal fidelity which they all display. Rahel is Goethe's, from
          the first breath she draws as a grown-up woman to her last. Bettina is Goethe's, with such
          absorbing devotion that the scheme of erecting a colossal monument to him which she
          advocated in her first published work (a monument which she herself planned and had
          executed in miniature), becomes in her old age an _idée fixe_. Charlotte so entirely
          belongs to the man on whom her choice falls when she is sixteen, that she not only lives
          for him, but dies for him.</p>

        <p>Another thing they have in common is enthusiasm. Rahel's burns like a steady, sacred
          flame; Bettina's breaks out in a pyrotechnic display of ideas and visions; Charlotte's
          manifests itself in the resolute, uncomplaining sacrifice of <pb n="303"/> her life. It is
          genius that they all worship; they have the enthusiastic German appreciation of poetic
          genius; their great desire is to do what in them lies to promote its recognition and
          glorification, or its development and emancipation; to this task they devote their lives,
          regardless of the worthiness or unworthiness of the object of their choice. Lastly, the
          thoughts and feelings of all three are remarkably original. These women resemble no other
          women. Never, to our knowledge, has there been such another reflective emotionalist as
          Rahel, such another sylph-like enthusiast as Bettina, such another suicide as Charlotte's,
          a suicide inspired by a lofty though false æsthetic principle.</p>

        <p>Those who look deeper into the matter and view these characters in the light of history,
          see in Rahel's introspection and self-reflection, the first form which woman's
          self-emancipation necessarily took in the Germany of this century; this height of
          intellectual independence had to be attained before the women in a country where they for
          centuries had been relegated to simple domesticity could rise to anything above it. In
          Bettina's triple enthusiasm, for Goethe, for the ideas of political liberalism, and for
          social reform, the student of history descries the transition stage between the era of art
          and the era of liberalism and socialism. And in Charlotte's suicide he sees an expression
          of the desire of the women of her day to snatch the men from their literary quietism and
          place them face to face with the seriousness, the tragedy of life. The whole era speaks
          when she says to Stieglitz that the song of the violet cannot be sung to the accompaniment
          of a great waterfall. None of these women could have developed as they did at any other
          period, and at no other period would they have been understood and appreciated as they
          were. To-day, already, we find it difficult to understand them.</p>

        <p>It is characteristic that the word _work_ finds no place in the description of their
          lives. They never learned anything methodically, and in their fear of being unfeminine are
          proud of this--as we observed in the case of Rahel. Even that accomplished linguist,
          Henriette Herz, is deeply offended because Jean Paul in one of his letters used the
          expression, <pb n="304"/> "M. Herz and his learned wife." Charlotte Stieglitz has not the
          faintest idea that talent is developed by work, by obstinate industry, and not by
          bereavements. And Bettina, the bayadere, who imitates Mignon's egg-dance, has nothing
          whatever to do with work. This fact impresses itself on us when we are annoyed by the
          slovenly composition and the want of any real understanding of politics in her book for
          the king.</p>

        <p>About the year 1848 it began to be recognised that all this intellectuality would have
          been more solid, more real, more lasting, if these women had known something, had followed
          some course of study, taken up one or other branch of science. All this soaring thought
          would have been doubly valuable if it had in the first place been subjected to regular
          discipline. To soar without previous training is often mere waste of power. If Rahel had
          had a solid foundation of knowledge to build upon, she would have had a very different
          influence upon posterity. As it is, her ideas, obscure and lucid, chaff and seed-corn, are
          scattered to the winds.</p>

        <p>In the Thirties men still believed in an inspiration that could dispense with knowledge,
          in a morality of the heart which rendered any reform of the old social morality
          unnecessary, in a defiance of law which allowed all laws to hold good, but kept clear of
          them all. This state of matters Young Germany was bent upon altering.</p>

        <p>During the Forties men had arrived at the persuasion that there was something of greater
          value than sudden inspiration and a life of pure intellectuality. There was humble and
          daring work to be done in science and in politics. We see German philosophy develop in the
          direction of radicalism, and we come upon poets whose aim it is to prepare the way for
          political liberty.</p>

        <p>FREDERICK WILLIAM OF PRUSSIA</p>

        <p>With the year 1840 the literary movement enters upon a new, more philosophic, and more
          political phase. Yet another generation had arisen, a generation which owed its
          profoundest culture to Hegel, and which, strangely enough, he had influenced chiefly in
          the direction of politics. Schelling in his day had declared art to be the highest
          manifestation of intellect. His principle, and that of the Romanticists, was that the
          artist is the true man. What art had been to Schelling, history was to Hegel--history,
          that eternal progress of the idea of liberty, that great liberty-epic. And what the work
          of art had been to Schelling, the State was to Hegel. To him the true, the perfect human
          being is not the artist, but the citizen of a constitutional State.</p>

        <p>This youngest generation was inspired by the Hegelian philosophy to make the reform of
          the State its aim. It held the adherents of the Young German school in light esteem, being
          of opinion that they had not stood bravely by their colours, either in philosophy or
          politics, that they were too belletristic, too epicurean. It would not join in the old cry
          for the rehabilitation of the flesh, would not even listen to it. Heine, in _Atta Troll_,
          had told the young generation that a man of character without talent was no better than a
          bear; the young men retorted that a man of talent without character was nothing but a
          monkey--possibly a very amusing monkey, but nothing more.</p>

        <p>That the Hegelian philosophy had again become a guiding principle was made plain when the
          periodical known as the _Hallische Jahrbücher_ was brought out by Ruge and Echtermeyer in
          1838. This organ of the Hegelians of the Left disseminated the ideas which moulded not
          only the <pb n="306"/> politicians but also the poets of the day. In all essentials the
          principles were the same as those in whose name Young Germany had taken the field, but
          they were now proclaimed with more scientific precision and more resoluteness. The elder
          men had to choose between joining the Young Hegelians and reprobating the principles of
          their own youth, as now proclaimed by others. As was only natural, they did not recognise
          their own opinions as propounded by these bellicose youths, and there was many a collision
          between the youngest generation and Gutzkow, Laube, and Mundt.</p>

        <p>The idea of the State now became the central idea of the day, the idea of the State as a
          living organism, realised in the consciousness of all its citizens. In the many
          philosophical, theological, æsthetic feuds waged by this new generation, the State and the
          necessity for its reform is always the burden of their cry. This was the season of
          preparation for that absorption in the idea of the State which is so characteristic of the
          Germany of later days, and which caused even a revolutionary (but a Hegelian
          revolutionary) like Lassalle to exclaim: "Do not malign the State! The State is God!" It
          is a sign of the nature of the literary development that the _Hallische Jahrbücher_ began
          as a philosophical, but was suppressed as a political periodical.[1]</p>

        <p>[1] _Cf_. R. Prütz: _Vorlesungen über die deutsche Litteratur der Gegenwart_.</p>

        <p>The new political ideas with which the nation was impregnated presently broke forth in
          poetry and song. The first political poetry appears in the same year as the _Jahrbücher_,
          and spreads political free-thought in far wider circles. At first it was for the most part
          rhetorical, and devoid of artistic value, but the common national feeling of the German
          countries had slumbered so long that the mere watch-words "liberty" and "fatherland"
          produced an electrical effect.</p>

        <p>On the 7th of June 1840, Frederick William IV. ascended the throne of Prussia. The new
          king presented in every respect a marked contrast to the man who, succeeding in 1797, had
          wielded the Prussian scepter for forty-two years. Frederick William III. had been the born
          soldier; his <pb n="307"/> son was an artist by nature, with mediocre half-suppressed
          talents, a dilettante in art and science. The father had been a sober, modest, steadfast
          character; the son was a fanciful enthusiast, as impressionable as a woman. The father had
          been the devotee of duty, an upright, dry, narrow-minded man, the son was full of romantic
          ideas, clever, famous for his witty sallies. The father had been tall, slender,
          soldierlike, in his bearing and dress; the son had soft, rounded features, not unlike
          Queen Louisa's, was fat rather than muscular, quick and jerky in his movements,
          communicative, sociable, very talkative. The father had been a reliable man, the son was
          an interesting one.</p>

        <p>Though Frederick William IV., as Crown Prince, had had the best of instructors in all the
          branches of a military education, he did not take the lead in military matters. He was
          fond of calling himself a Prussian officer, but the strict, pedantic discipline
          inseparable from military service in time of peace, was wearisome to him, and at times he,
          a Hohenzollern, was even known to jeer at State parades. Now and again, however, it
          happened that he grew wildly enthusiastic. At a review, the music, the clash of weapons,
          the loud commands, the firing, produced in him a sort of poetic excitement. Carried away
          by military enthusiasm, he once, on the occasion of a big sham-fight, led the troops right
          into Berlin, regardless of the confusion thereby produced, and of the hundreds of
          window-panes shattered by the volleys fired in the streets.[2]</p>

        <p>[2] Prutz: _Zehn Jahre_, i.</p>

        <p>But for the most part it was with men of science and artists that the Crown Prince
          consorted--scholars such as Humboldt, historians like Ranke, painters like Cornelius,
          sculptors like Rauch. He was much interested in architecture, made a study of the antique
          styles in their application to ecclesiastical architecture of the Byzantine type, sketched
          plans, tried to produce imposing effects by means of colonnades and halls. He projected
          ideal landscapes, resembling scenes on the Italian shores of the Mediterranean. He
          criticised music and poetry. He specially encouraged and patronised the study of ancient
          German customs and of <pb n="308"/> all ancient art which had devoted itself to the
          service of religion; and all this occupation with the past increased his distaste for the
          time in which he lived, and developed his inclination to restore the old order of things,
          or at any rate to oppose reforms inspired by the modern spirit.</p>

        <p>This inclination could not but be strengthened by the young prince's intercourse with
          clergymen, and with the small circle of romantically disposed aristocrats who were his
          familiar associates. From his childhood he had been religious. As a boy he had, during the
          war with Napoleon, learnt to believe in the sacredness of the old system of government, in
          the divine right of kings, and in the mission of Austria as heir of the Holy Roman Empire.
          He adopted the whole system of ideas and enthusiasms of which Joseph de Maistre was the
          first and ablest exponent. He studied Haller's _Restauration der Staatswissenschaft_. Ere
          long he came to look upon the crown as a mystic jewel, a combination of the priestly
          fillet of old with the dictator's golden wreath; the kingly office became in his eyes a
          sacred calling, the king himself a divinely inspired being. His ideal was a patriarchal
          relation between the king and his people, much the same ideal as that which was aimed at
          during the same period by the so-called Young England, the followers of Disraeli.</p>

        <p>Frederick William IV. was received by his people with all the confident expectation with
          which a nation that is still in its political childhood welcomes a new king. They believed
          of him what is believed of all crown princes, that his principles were more liberal than
          his father's. The hopes and expectations of the nation surrounded him with a sort of halo.
          He began, as kings are wont to do, with an act which appeared to justify the popular
          estimate of his character; he proclaimed a general amnesty for political offences. This
          led all to hope that he would fulfil the political desire of the country, that he would
          confer on Prussia that benefit which was regarded as a necessary condition of all
          progress, constitutional government.</p>

        <p>As already stated, the Prussian people were in possession of a distinct, definite, royal
          promise of a constitution, a pro<pb n="309"/>mise the fulfilment of which had been
          dishonestly delayed. This made their hope all the stronger; they felt sure that this
          promise would now be redeemed.</p>

        <p>Soon after the new king's accession, the Estates of the Provinces of Posen and East and
          West Prussia were summoned to meet at Königsberg, for the purpose of paying homage to him.
          The Estates of East and West Prussia replied to the announcement of this meeting by
          sending in a most humble petition to the king, in which they besought him to maintain and
          to complete the system of representative government inaugurated by his glorious father,
          who, in this as in all else faithful to his promise, had introduced representative
          government in the provinces, but had left the completion of the work to his royal
          successor "whom the nation loves with the truest devotion, and on whom its dearest hopes
          are set" (in welchem die treueste Liebe und die innigsten Wünsche des Landes sich
          begegnen).</p>

        <p>The lower classes of citizens, all those who hoped that their trades and industries would
          profit by the approaching festivities at Königsberg, were highly incensed by this
          proceeding, which they considered calculated to offend the king. The higher classes, on
          the contrary, imagined that their gifted monarch would at once gladly accede to the
          legitimate desire of his people; no one was in a better position than he to understand the
          defects of the old system of representation. But neither those who dreaded an outburst of
          royal indignation nor those who expected a manifestation of royal liberal-mindedness
          proved to be right.</p>

        <p>Frederick William's vague answer was to the effect that the constitution of the Estates
          rested upon a national, historic foundation, that the king took a deep interest in the
          said institution, that he was firmly determined to pursue the path entered on by his
          predecessors, and that his faithful Estates might "place absolute confidence in his
          intentions" with regard to the institution of the Landtag (Parliament).</p>

        <p>Little of positive assurance as there was in this message, it was received with joy; it
          relieved one party from the dread of a stern rebuff, and encouraged the sanguine hopes <pb
            n="310"/> of the other. The festival at Königsberg went off successfully, and was marked
          by general enthusiasm. Its most imposing incident occurred immediately after the deputies
          had repeated, word for word, the oath of allegiance read out to them. Hardly had the echo
          of the loud Amen pronounced by the four hundred voices died away, when the king was seen
          to rise from the throne, which stood upon an open balcony, come forward to the rails,
          raise his arm as if he were taking an oath, and begin to address the assembly. Every word
          of his speech was clearly audible. He promised to be a just judge, a faithful,
          painstaking, and merciful ruler, a Christian king like his ever-to-be-remembered father.
          The concluding sentence bears witness to his literary gift: "May God preserve our Prussian
          fatherland, for its own sake, for Germany's, and for the world's--our fatherland, which is
          made up of many parts, and yet is one whole, like that noble metal, a mixture of many
          others, but itself one metal, liable to no rust but the beautifying rust of
          centuries!"</p>

        <p>Astonishment that a King of Prussia should thus of his own free will give a promise to
          his people in return for theirs to him, combined with the impression produced by this
          ostensibly improvised address from such an animated and winning royal personage, to create
          a feeling of excited jubilation. Above on the balcony the queen burst into tears, down
          below the people wept, smiled through their tears, and pressed each other's hands. In the
          transport of the moment it was not observed that there was no definite political promise
          in the speech, nothing but liberal generalities and romantic phraseology.</p>

        <p>But the Königsberg festival was only a prelude to the great one held in Berlin. In the
          minds of the inhabitants of his capital a halo of golden promises still surrounded the
          person of the king. They were determined to do everything in their power to show their
          devotion, and to give the festival a character that was likely to be agreeable to him. The
          military element was not allowed to preponderate; something in the style of a medieval
          German municipal pageant was aimed at. The different guilds, numbering in <pb n="311"/>
          all about 10,000 men, marched in procession, carrying their banners and emblems. As an
          agreeable little surprise for the king, a great projecting piece of masonry at the Rathaus
          (town hall) with which his carriage had come into collision one day when he was Crown
          Prince, was altogether removed.</p>

        <p>In the interval between the two festivals an incident occurred which could not but awaken
          in the mind of the nation a suspicion of the king's fickleness. On the 4th of October
          1840, a royal order in council was published which intimated, to prevent any
          misunderstanding, that the king, in expressing his appreciation of the loyalty of the
          Estates, had by no means declared himself to be in favour of a representative constitution
          as formulated in the ordinance of the 22nd of May.</p>

        <p>The princes and nobles were to take the oath of allegiance in the palace, the citizens
          were to pay homage in the great square outside the so-called Lustgarten. But from early
          morning rain fell in torrents. For two whole hours the citizens stood outside the square,
          getting soaked through, whilst the king listened, indoors, to the speeches of princes,
          nobles, and clergy, and gave the rein to his own eloquence.</p>

        <p>At last he stepped out on the balcony. But on this occasion people were prepared to hear
          him speak; there was no question of improvisation. Berlin would have felt itself insulted
          if the king, who had made a speech at Königsberg, had received its homage in silence. And
          speak he did. Every one could see the motion of his hands, but the size of the square and
          the sound of the wind and the rain prevented his words being heard. Every time he stopped
          speaking, the attentive crowd, imagining that the speech was concluded, broke forth in
          loud acclamation; but the king waved his hand, and proceeded. The rain poured, but still
          he spoke. All watched his gesticulations. Four times the multitude shouted "Hurrah!" in
          the belief that he had done, and four times he began again. He promised to rule as one who
          feared God and loved man, with his eyes open when attending to the needs of the people and
          of the times, closed when called on to do justice<pb n="312"/>--but the antithesis was
          lost in the whistle of the wind and the rush of the rain. He shouted: "Will you promise,
          while I am striving so to do, to stand by me, in prosperity and in adversity? If so, give
          an answer in that plainest, finest word of our mother-tongue, an honest 'Ja!'" Shouts of
          "Bravo! bravo!" from the square. They thought he had finished. But the king waved his hand
          and continued. At last he concluded by turning the downpour of rain to account in his
          peroration, by taking it as a favourable omen--though this also was lost on the audience.
          "So help me God, I will keep the promises which I have made here and at Königsberg! In
          sign hereof I raise my right hand to heaven. Proceed we now with our high festival, and
          may God's blessing fall like his fertilising rain upon us this day!"</p>

        <p>But God's fertilising rain completely extinguished the festive spirit, poured its
          chilling prose over both audience and orator.</p>

        <p>No one could observe that any promises were kept, but neither could any one name any
          particular promises that had been made by his Majesty. The new king and his government
          soon showed themselves in their true light.</p>

        <p>Eichhorn was nominated Minister of Public Worship (_Kultusminister_) in place of the late
          Count Altenstein, the patron of Hegel and the Hegelians. Eichhorn had already shown
          Pietistic leanings; it was reported that he intended to introduce strict regulations
          regarding the observation of holy-days, and possibly also rules of church discipline
          binding on all Government officials. The indignation roused by this report was so great
          that advantage was taken of the first possible opportunity to display it. Racine's
          _Athalie_ was put on the stage by the king's special request. There was no fault to be
          found with the play itself, but it had a religious subject and had been originally written
          for the inmates of a convent. On the occasion of its first performance, January 4th, 1841,
          it was hissed by the audience, a demonstration the meaning of which every one understood.
          People were much more exasperated with the minister than with the king; for no one doubted
          that the king was a sincerely religious man, whereas the life Eichhorn had <pb n="313"/>
          lived and the company he had kept led them to conclude the opposite of him. And when it
          came to his making public use of the expression, "the Christian state," that is the state
          of which the unorthodox cannot be reckoned true citizens, war was waged against this
          "square circle," as the expression was called, with all the weapons of sober earnest and
          of mockery. Unfortunately the king had, a few months before this, in one of his fits of
          political liberalism, possibly influenced by his appreciation of wit, abolished the
          censorship of caricature-drawing. So now Eichhorn was to be seen everywhere, in the shape
          of a squirrel (_Eichhorn_ = squirrel) gnawing leaves, cracking the empty nut of the
          Christian Church, &amp;c., &amp;c. The ungrateful caricaturists did not even respect the
          king; and Heine, the greatest caricaturist of the age, ridiculed royal indecision in the
          following lines of _Der neue Alexander_:</p>

        <p> "Ich ward ein Zwitter, ein Mittelding, das weder Fleisch noch Fisch ist, Das von den
          Extremen unserer Zeit ein närrisches Gemisch ist. Ich bin nicht schlecht, ich bin nicht
          gut, nicht dumm und nicht gescheute, Und wenn ich gestern vorwärts ging, so geh ich
          rückwärts heute."[3]</p>

        <p>[3] I'm neither fish nor flesh, neither this nor that, but a queer compound of the
          extremes of the day; I'm not bad, I'm not good, not stupid and not clever; if I walked
          forwards yesterday, I'll walk backwards to-day.</p>

        <p>But Eichhorn was not content with Christianising the State, he aimed at Christianising
          science. He was particularly desirous to oust known Hegelians from all good and
          influential appointments, the Hegelian philosophy being distasteful to the king, because
          it left no play for his imagination.</p>

        <p>It was by the king's wish that Schelling was brought from Munich to Berlin to fill the
          professorial chair left vacant by the death of Hegel, that from that vantage ground he
          might propound his new philosophy, that _Philosophie der Offenbarung_ (Philosophy of
          Revelation) which, like some quack remedy, had been kept secret for years, and yet puffed
          as if it were to introduce a new era. He received a larger salary than had ever before
          been given to a Prussian <pb n="314"/> university professor (it was declared that he was
          almost as well paid as a _premiere danseuse_); and it was certainly not the king's fault
          that, in spite of all Schelling's endeavours, there seemed no possibility of eradicating
          Hegelian unorthodoxy. As a matter of fact, Schelling was a failure. He could not but feel
          that he was regarded with contempt by the whole youth of a nation. Ch. Kapp wrote a clever
          description of the court thinker's various metamorphoses since the days of his youth, his
          apostasy from himself, the humbug in his reconciliation of faith and thought; and Ludwig
          Feuerbach, in his energetic language, styled him the philosophical Cagliostro of the
          nineteenth century, and his philosophy a theosophic farce.</p>

        <p>Eichhorn proceeded to take a variety of measures to counteract the progress of science.
          He set a fixed limit to the number of teachers at all the different Prussian universities,
          thereby reducing the number of private lecturers and increasing the influence of the
          Government. Professor Hoffman (von Fallersleben) was dismissed from the University of
          Breslau, because of some harmless jests at politics in his _Unpolitical Songs_--jovial,
          catching verses, which so exactly chimed in with the Liberal ideas of the middle-class
          citizen that they alarmed the authorities. The Biblical critic, Bruno Bauer's, two books
          on the authenticity of the Four Gospels cost him his post of lecturer at the University of
          Bonn. The servile Faculties carried out the wishes of the Government: they approved of
          free scientific inquiry, but could not approve of Bruno Bauer as a lecturer on _theology_.
          The Hegelian theologian, Marheineke of Berlin, undauntedly declared that he, too, was
          desirous that Bruno Bauer should be relieved from his post as lecturer, because he
          considered that such an eminent critic, a man of such thorough scientific training, should
          be promoted to a really influential appointment. But Bauer's fate was sealed. The Halle
          students petitioned that David Strauss might be appointed professor at their university.
          The answer to their petition was a reprimand, and the three students whose names headed
          the list of petitioners were expelled. After Gans's death, the noted reactionary Stahl
          (author of <pb n="315"/> _Umkehr der Wissenschaft_) was appointed to his professorship in
          Berlin. It was somewhat humiliating for the Government that the students refused to listen
          to Stahl's first lecture; they drummed him out of the lecture-room.</p>

        <p>In the summer of 1841 there appeared in Switzerland a little book, entitled _Gedichte
          eines Lebendigen_ ("Poems of a Living Man"). It contained many an astounding verse; among
          others:</p>

        <p> "Reisst die Kreuze aus der Erden! Alle sollen Schwerter werden! Gott im Himmel wird's
          verzeihn. Lasst, o lasst das Verseschweissen, Auf den Amboss legt das Eisen, Heiland soll
          das Eisen sein."[4]</p>

        <p>[4]</p>

        <p> Tear the crosses from the graves; 'Tis the sword alone that saves; God forgives the deed
          ye do. Leave, oh leave your rhyming trade; Steel on anvil must be laid-- Steel shall bring
          us safely through. (JOYNES.)</p>

        <p>And:</p>

        <p> "Brause, Gott, mit Sturmesodem durch die fürchterliche Stille, Gieb ein Trauerspiel der
          Freiheit für der Sklaverei Idylle! Lass das Herz doch wieder schlagen in der Brust der
          kalten Welt Und erweck ihr einen Rächer und erweck ihr einen Held!"[5]</p>

        <p>[5] Let thy tempest blow, O God, and put an end to this terrible calm! Give us a tragedy
          of liberty in place of this idyll of slavery! Set the heart of the clay-cold world beating
          again; raise up for her an avenger; awaken for her a hero!</p>

        <p>The collection was prefaced by a poetical challenge "To the Dead Man," namely Prince
          Pückler, who had written under this pseudonym. He was chosen as the representative of the
          careless pleasure-lovers who seek distraction in travel. The attack was unjust, but how
          fine it sounded!</p>

        <p>The anonymous author, whose name soon became public property, was a young man of
          twenty-four, Georg Herwegh, born in Würtemberg in 1817, and educated at the well-known
          Tübingen Institution. While serving his time in the army, Herwegh quarrelled with an
          officer, and was <pb n="316"/> obliged to take refuge in Switzerland, where he lived for
          several years, associating with other refugees and other youthful Radicals. His poems,
          with their fresh, energetic, and yet vague Radicalism, at once made their mark, and
          attained an immense circulation in the course of a few months. The sentiment of these
          poems is somewhat mixed. Now it is with tyrants, now with Philistines, that their author
          is at war; at one time he discovers the enemies of the good cause in Germany itself, at
          another abroad; now he writes as a staunch Republican; again, following the example of
          Platen, he appeals earnestly, imploringly to the King of Prussia, warning him, but at the
          same time assuring him that it is not too late:</p>

        <p> "Du bist der Stern, auf den man schaut, Der letzte Fürst, auf den man baut."[6]</p>

        <p>[6]</p>

        <p> Thou art the star to which we turn our eyes, Of monarchs all the last in whom our hope
          yet lies.</p>

        <p>The public of that day overlooked the young poet's want of consistency; his enthusiasm
          was infectious, his melodious lyrical rhetoric irresistible. He was the first lyric poet
          who had taken men's hearts by storm since the days of Goethe and Schiller. From the Alps
          to the Baltic the young men sang: _Reisst die Kreuze aus der Erden!_</p>

        <p>In the autumn of 1842 Herwegh took a tour through Germany, with a practical aim in view.
          The work which he had begun as a poet, he desired to carry on as a journalist, a political
          writer; his journey was undertaken for the purpose of securing contributors to a monthly
          magazine to be entitled _Der deutsche Bote aus der Schweiz_ ("The German Messenger from
          Switzerland"); but it became a sort of triumphal progress; he was entertained at banquets
          in Cologne and Leipzig, and serenaded by the students of Jena; never before had such
          homage been paid to a German poet.</p>

        <p>Towards the end of October he arrived in Berlin, where he could not expect to make as
          great a sensation, especially as he had followed the advice of his companion, Ruge, and
          refused the advances of a very unprosperous Radical <pb n="317"/> association. But
          something happened which made far more impression on the public mind than any popular
          demonstration could have done--the king expressed a wish to make Herwegh's personal
          acquaintance.</p>

        <p>So far the only public manifestation of Frederick William's æsthetic sympathies had been
          his patronage of Tieck and Rückert, both of whom he had invited to Berlin. Ludwig Tieck,
          now an old man, crippled with rheumatism, occasionally read aloud at Court and put plays
          on the stage; Friedrich Rückert was expected to assist in reorganising the study of
          Oriental languages at the University, but proved unfit for the task. Unprejudiced judgment
          in literary matters was certainly not traditional in the Hohenzollern family. There was
          only one possible precedent for the audience granted to Herwegh, and that was to be found
          in the present king's own private reply to the ode in which Platen conjured him to embrace
          the cause of unhappy Poland. In a cordial letter to the poet, Frederick William, then
          Crown Prince, expressed his hearty sympathy with the Poles and bewailed his inability to
          help. The ode addressed by Herwegh to the king implored him to put down clericalism; it
          was an agreeable surprise to find that this had given no offence.</p>

        <p>The audience took place on the 19th of November 1842. Herwegh was very silent, depressed
          by the situation. The king was, as usual, eloquent and communicative. He is reported to
          have said: "You are the second enemy whom I have received this year; the first was M.
          Thiers (who had threatened war in 1840, because of the support given by the great powers
          to the Sultan in his quarrel with the Egyptian Pacha); but it gives me greater pleasure to
          see you. We have our vocations, you and I; mine is to be a king, yours to be a poet. I
          shall be faithful to mine, as I trust you will be to yours. Nothing is more abhorrent to
          me than vacillation; I esteem an Opposition which is actuated by real conviction (wenn sie
          nur gesinnungsvoll ist)." Referring to Herwegh's youth, he prophesied "a Damascus day" for
          him, concluding with the words: "Until then, let us be honourable enemies."</p>

        <p><pb n="318"/> Such particulars of this meeting of king and poet as reached the ears of
          the public awakened feelings either of childish envy or childish indignation among the
          oppositionist writers of the day. It was considered that Herwegh ought (_à la_ Marquis
          Posa) to have taken advantage of the opportunity to demand political liberty for
          Prussia.</p>

        <p>A few days after the audience, Herwegh left Berlin. At Königsberg, where he was again
          entertained at a banquet, he was surprised to receive the news that his projected
          periodical, before its appearance, had been declared contraband in Prussia. It was a
          prohibition for which he might well have been prepared, for all books published abroad
          (his own poems included) were contraband, except those for which special licence had been
          granted. But already irritated by accusations of treason brought against him in one and
          another Radical newspaper, he was completely upset by this rebuff, and at once addressed
          an awkward, unmanly, would-be pathetic letter to the king.</p>

        <p>He pleaded the king's promise of honourable enmity, a promise which he declared to be
          broken by this prohibition; he would not ask the king to revoke this edict, though it was
          hard for him to see the child of his Muse menaced while yet in its mother's womb, and hard
          to have to live in a state of constant warfare with the law of the country; not that the
          prohibition did him any harm, for he was fortunate enough to be at that moment preparing
          the fifth edition of his poems, also a prohibited book; but he felt impelled to address a
          last, honest, impassioned appeal to the king; an appeal which, though private, was not
          merely his own, but that of thousands, &amp;c, &amp;c.</p>

        <p>The letter itself was stupid and indiscreet; its publication in a Leipzig newspaper a few
          weeks later was a piece of folly that avenged itself. In Stettin, Herwegh received orders
          to leave the country; policemen escorted him to the stage-coach, from which he was
          forbidden to alight in Halle. He had received a festive welcome in Prussia, but his
          leave-taking was of the coldest.</p>

        <p>The arch-scoffer Heine, in his poem, _Der Ex-lebendige_, has the following lines:</p>

        <p><pb n="319"/> "Aranchuez! in deinem Sand' Wie schnell die schönen Tage schwanden, Als ich
          vor König Philip stand Und seinen uckermarkschen Granden.</p>

        <p> Er hat mir Beifall zugenickt, Als ich gespielt den Marquis Posa, In Versen hab' ich ihn
          entzückt Doch ihm gefiel nicht meine Prosa."[7]</p>

        <p>[7] O my Aranchuez! how the days flew that I spent amidst thy sands! those days when I
          stood in the presence of King Philip and his Uckermark grandees. He nodded approval to me
          when I played Marquis Posa; my verses charmed him, but my prose he could not stand.</p>

        <p>And in _Die Audienz_ he jeers more mercilessly still at the Swabian suckling:</p>

        <p> "'Ich will, wie einst mein Heiland that, Am Anblick der Kinder mich laben. Lass zu mir
          kommen die Kindlein, zumal Das grosse Kind aus Schwaben.'</p>

        <p> So sprach der König, der Kämmerer lief Und kam zurück und brachte Herein das grosse
          Schwabenkind Das seinen Diener machte.</p>

        <p> Der König sprach: 'Du bist wohl ein Schwab? Das ist just keine Schande.' 'Gerathen!
          erwidert der Schwab, ich bin Geboren im Schwabenlande.' . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
          'Erbitte dir eine Gnade,' sprach Der König. Da kniete nieder Der Schwabe und rief: 'O
          geben Sie, Sire! Dem Volke die Freiheit wieder.'</p>

        <p> Der König stand erschüttert tief; Es war eine schöne Scene. Mit seinem Rockärmel wischte
          sich Der Schwab' aus dem Auge die Thräne.</p>

        <p> Der König sprach endlich: 'Ein schöner Traum! Leb' wohl und werde gescheidter! Und da du
          ein Somnambülericht bist, So geb' ich dir zwei Begleiter.</p>

        <p><pb n="320"/> Zwei sichre Gendarm', die sollen dich Bis an die Grenze führen. Leb' wohl,
          ich muss zur Parade geh'n, Schon hör ich die Trommel rühren.'"[8]</p>

        <p>[8]</p>

        <p> "I will, as my gracious Saviour did, Find the sight of the children pleasant; So suffer
          the children to come, and first The big one, the Swabian peasant."</p>

        <p> Thus spake the monarch; the chamberlain ran, And return'd, introducing slowly The
          stalwart child from Swabia's land, Who made a reverence lowly.</p>

        <p> Thus spake the king: "A Swabian art thou? There's no disgrace in that, surely?" "Quite
          right! I was born in Swabia's land," Replied the Swabian demurely. . . . . . . . . . . . .
          . . . "One wish I will grant thee," the monarch said-- Then the Swabian in deep
          supplication Knelt down and exclaimed: "O sire, I pray grant Their freedom once more to
          the nation!"</p>

        <p> The monarch in deep amazement stood, The scene was really enthralling; With his sleeve
          the Swabian wiped from his eye The tear that was well-nigh falling.</p>

        <p> At last said the king: "In truth a fine dream! Farewell, and pray learn discretion; And
          as a somnambulist plainly thou art, Of thy person I'll give the possession</p>

        <p> To two trusty gendarmes, whose duty 'twill be To see thee safe over the border--
          Farewell! I must hasten to join the parade, The drums are beating to order."
          (BOWRING.)</p>

        <p>It was not only humour that laughed, but envy and vindictiveness as well. Men wreaked
          vengeance on their own former enthusiasm. The Herwegh catastrophe was, moreover, attended
          by disastrous practical results. The _Leipziger Allgemeine Zeitung_, the Opposition
          newspaper most widely read in Prussia, was suppressed the day after it published the
          letter to the king. The _Rheinische Zeitung_, the principal Liberal paper published in
          Prussia, itself very soon received <pb n="321"/> its death-blow. And in Saxony, at the
          request of Prussia, Arnold Ruge's _Deutsche Jahrbücher_ (first known as the _Hallische
          Jahrbücher_), the leading periodical expressing the opinions of the reflective youth of
          the day, was also suppressed.</p>

        <p>One lesson the young generation learned from what had happened. It was no momentous
          matter that a young poet should have shown himself embarrassed and then unmanly in his
          relations with a king. But the men of this day had imagined themselves to have taken a
          great step in advance of the men of the Thirties; they believed that they possessed
          strength of character, whereas their elders had only been gifted with talent. Now it was
          borne in upon them, not only that poets are little calculated to make good political
          leaders, but also that the whole generation must discipline itself severely if it were to
          stand any firmer in the day of trial than its predecessors had done.</p>

        <p>So now thinkers and politicians by profession (in almost too many instances professors)
          took the lead. And the fact that the generation which now revolutionised the mind of
          Germany failed so miserably in the close of the struggle of 1848, is to be ascribed, not
          to want of strength of character, but to that idealism which is bred in the minds of men
          who have never ruled, to their belief in the irresistible powers of ideas and ideals to
          realise themselves, and to their contempt for that external brute force, which in theory
          was of minor importance, but which, vanquished in the first brush, calmly allowed itself
          to be disdained, and awaited the moment when, with renewed vigour, it returned to the
          attack.</p>

        <p>There was considerable difference of opinion as to the advisability of the various
          measures taken by Frederick William's ministers, but for the most part they were
          unfavourably criticised. Under every other question smouldered the question of the
          Prussian Constitution. The king's attempt to dispose of it by a rebuff had been
          unsuccessful, and the means which he and his advisers employed to put down the movement
          were extremely infelicitous. In the Silesian Landtag (Parliament) the chief magistrate and
          other representatives of the town of Breslau had proposed an address from the Silesian
          Estates on the <pb n="322"/> subject of a general assembly of the Estates of the whole
          kingdom--a Reichstag. The king replied by a special announcement of the procedure to be
          observed on the occasion of his approaching visit to Silesia, intimating that no
          arrangements need be made for his festive reception and entertainment in Breslau, as he
          would accept nothing from that town. This in May, in reference to a journey to be taken in
          October, and festivities of which there had as yet been no offer! And the king entered
          Breslau in state and was fêted after all, though the festivities were not held specially
          on his account, but on the occasion of the hundredth anniversary of the incorporation of
          Silesia with Prussia. He contented himself with deploring the absence in the invitation
          sent him of "expressions which would have given him heart-felt pleasure," and with
          declining to stay longer than a day or two on account of want of time.</p>

        <p>Yet the king stood in need of the consent of the Estates of the realm to the carrying out
          of a project of the utmost importance for the whole country. The time of railways had
          come, and two matters had to be arranged, a loan of the money needed for the construction
          of State railways, and a State guarantee to the constructors of private lines. According
          to a law passed by Hardenberg in 1820, the consent of the Estates of the realm was
          imperative in both cases. The king evolved an impossible plan; he proposed to convoke an
          assembly of six hundred representatives chosen from the different provincial Landtage, and
          to let this assembly play the part of Reichstände (Estates of the realm). Metternich was
          obliged to interfere, and prove the utter impracticability of the scheme.[9]</p>

        <p>[9] Sybel: _Die Begründung des deutschen Reiches_, i. 107.</p>

        <p>It was at this juncture that a small pamphlet, _Vier Fragen eines Ostpreussen_ ("Four
          Questions by an East-Prussian"), made a sensation throughout the whole of Germany. The
          little book appeared on the spiritual horizon like the first distant flash of lightning
          that preludes the storm. Purporting to be printed in Mannheim, it was scattered abroad
          everywhere in the end of February 1841. Such careful arrangements had been made that it
          found its way into the <pb n="323"/> booksellers' windows of every town in Prussia on the
          same day--every town except Berlin, where it appeared a little later, a precaution taken
          to prevent confiscation before the general distribution.</p>

        <p>The Four Questions which it contained foreboded the downfall of absolute monarchy. They
          were: What did the Estates ask? What right had they to make such a request? What answer
          did they receive? What remains for them to do?</p>

        <p>The book's answer to the first question was that, as things now stood, the people had
          almost no share in their own government, although the general high level of education made
          it natural that they should wish it. And their desire for a representative constitution,
          for a national parliament, was made more ardent by the fact that they possessed no other
          means, such, for instance, as a free press, of expressing their opinions, and that they
          thoroughly distrusted the king's ministers because of their arbitrariness, servility, and
          pietistic tendencies. To the question: What right had the Estates to make such a demand?
          the author replied: The right of authority, an authority declared and recognised on the
          22nd of May 1815. To the third question: What answer did they receive? the reply was: A
          recognition of their loyalty, a rejection of their proposal, and comforting promises of
          some vague future indemnification. The answer to the fourth question: What remains for the
          Estates to do? only occupied a line and a half. It was: To demand now as a demonstrable
          right what they had previously solicited as an act of grace.</p>

        <p>The earnest, impressive tone of the pamphlet, its appeal to the people's sense of justice
          and self-respect, aroused a keen desire to know the name of the anonymous author. He
          himself had sent his book to the king, with his name written on the title page: Dr. Johann
          Jacoby, physician in Königsberg. The king at once ordered criminal proceedings to be
          instituted against him. It appeared that he was a man of means, and a very highly esteemed
          physician. In 1831, during the first and most violent epidemic of cholera in Poland, he
          had gone there to study the disease. At a <pb n="324"/> later period he had had a
          protracted quarrel with a Warsaw doctor, a regular quack, who, when the cholera broke out
          again in 1837, advertised his discovery of an infallible remedy for "this trivial, easily
          curable disease." Jacoby wrote a short scientific article in disparagement of this man.
          The quack wrote an answer full of insulting imputations, which he published in the Berlin
          newspapers. By the help of influential friends he not only managed to secure the
          prohibition of the publication of Jacoby's retort, but also to defeat the latter's
          successive appeals to the Berlin censor's superior, to the highest council of censorship,
          to Rochow, the Secretary of State, and to the king himself. The publishers in Hamburg,
          Leipzig, Grimma, Basle, and Berne, one and all refused to print the documents throwing
          light on this affair. Any other man would now have given up the attempt to get his reply
          to an attack in a contemptible newspaper article published. Not so Jacoby. Month followed
          upon month. The manuscript travelled thousands of miles, and was published at last in
          Paris, under the title of _Contribution to a Future Historical Account of the Censorship
          of the Press in Prussia_.</p>

        <p>Such was Jacoby's character. Here at last was found what Young Germany so sorely needed,
          what even Youngest Germany with its Herwegh had not produced, that first essential in
          public life--a man. At last the Germany of the Forties had found a strong political
          leader--not a statesman in the proper sense of the word, for time showed that he was
          incapable of accommodating himself to circumstances, that he could not be satisfied with
          aiming at the attainable; but a man of inflexible will, of absolute integrity, who with
          indomitable courage pressed onwards to his goal.</p>

        <p>The Government organs, the libellous press, began a systematic attack upon him. There was
          nothing to lay hold of in his blameless personality, but he was of Jewish descent. In a
          little pamphlet published by the local magnates of a small town in the neighbourhood of
          Königsberg under the title of _Stimme treuer Unterthanen seiner Majestät des Königs von
          Preussen_ ("Voice of a Few Faithful Subjects of his Majesty the King of Prussia"), we
          read: "Not from <pb n="325"/> German, not from Christian lips did these words proceed....
          East-Prussia would be disgraced if her sons had expressed such sentiments.... The seed of
          Jacob did not hearken to the voice of God, did not acknowledge his only begotten son, but
          put him to death; therefore they were cast off for ever, and scattered abroad among the
          nations of the earth." Presently, however, in all the booksellers' windows the portrait of
          Jacoby was to be seen; his face, with its clear-cut features, was surrounded by four marks
          of interrogation; he held his pen like a lance poised for attack.</p>

        <p>The significance of the man who thus made his appearance was felt by the poets, even by
          those with least strength of character, even by Dingelstedt, who was then preparing to
          barter his oppositionist principles for the title of _Hofrath_ (Privy Councillor). In
          Dingelstedt's fine collection of poems, _Nachtwächters Weltgang_, we find one with the
          heading: ????, evidently addressed to the King of Prussia:</p>

        <p> "Du weisst, was das bedeuten will? Du wirst sie mir nicht streichen? Es sind ja nur
          unschuldige--vier kleine Fragezeichen. Die wurzeln tief, die ragen hoch; wie die gerühmten
          Eichen Des freien deutschen Volkes stehn vier kleine Fragezeichen. Du wolltest sie zwar
          nimmer sehn in deinen weiten Reichen, Doch drängen sie sich immer auf, vier kleine
          Fragezeichen. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Und einst, wenn du
          gestorben bist, als Stempel dann und Aichen Stehn gross an deinem Monument--vier kleine
          Fragezeichen."[10]</p>

        <p>[10] You know the meaning of these marks? You would never dream of erasing them--four
          innocent little marks of interrogation? Yet they strike deep root, they mount towards
          heaven, like the oak, the emblem of the great, free German nation. You have done your best
          to annihilate them throughout your wide realms, but they persistently appear again, these
          four little marks of interrogation.... In years to come, when you are dead, there will
          stand as sign and symbol on your monument--four little marks of interrogation.</p>

        <p>Herwegh, too, sang Jacoby's praises, as if he had a prevision that this was a man who,
          placed face to face with the King of Prussia, would play a more manly part than he himself
          had done. And the prevision was correct In November 1848, when the king replied to the
          deputation that waited on him to demand a change of ministers: "I will not listen to any
          communication on this subject," it was Jacoby who <pb n="326"/> stepped forward and said:
          "It is the great misfortune of kings, that they will not listen to the truth." Herwegh's
          poem, which has a J. as headings, begins:</p>

        <p> "Und wieder ob den Landen Lag jüngst ein schwerer Bann: Da ist ein Mann erstanden, Ein
          ganzer, deutscher Mann. Ein deutscher und ein freier, Wer hätte das gedacht! Dass selbst
          die deutsche Leier Aus ihrem Schlaf erwacht."[11]</p>

        <p>[11] Our country in these latter days lay under a heavy ban; but, behold! there arose to
          deliver her one who with truth could be called a man. A German, and a freeman--who could
          have dreamt it? who could have looked for this awakening of the German lyre?</p>

        <p>The proceedings against Jacoby were carried on with extraordinary vigour. In less than
          four weeks he was brought up for examination twenty times; ninety-six witnesses gave
          evidence, shop-women, cooks, and school-children among the number. His real misdemeanour
          was merely a transgression of the press-laws, namely circumvention of censorship. But he
          was accused of instigation to disaffection--for which the punishment was two years'
          imprisonment and disfranchisement; of _lèse-majesté_--for which the punishment was four
          years' penal servitude; and of high treason--punishment, "death, with application of the
          most severe and deterrent pains and penalties."</p>

        <p>It was in his native town, Königsberg, that Jacoby was brought to trial; but the court
          there declared itself incompetent to deal with the case, seeing that it was one of high
          treason, and passed it on to the Kammergericht in Berlin. The Kammergericht, aware that
          the charge of high treason was untenable, also declared itself unqualified, and sent it
          back. The king was obliged to issue an order in council, requiring the Königsberg court to
          proceed with the trial. It was altogether to Jacoby's advantage to be tried by his
          fellow-citizens; but he disdained the idea of an illegal acquittal, and obstinately
          demanded to be tried by the Kammergericht in Berlin, since he was accused of high <pb
            n="327"/> treason. His wish had to be complied with. He was condemned to two and a half
          years' imprisonment with hard labour and disfranchisement. But three years later the
          highest court of appeal pronounced a full and free acquittal.</p>

        <p>In the meantime all over Germany money was collected to present him with a civic wreath;
          subscriptions poured in; the names of eminent men headed the lists. Once more the
          Government was obliged to take action; the subscription lists were seized, the subscribers
          summoned, and a stop put to the whole proceeding. While the police and the censors were
          thus struggling to suppress the agitation for a free constitution, there was issued, on
          the 11th of August 1842, the most absurd regulation of which there is any record in the
          annals of an autocratically governed country--one of the country's own existing laws was
          added to the list of prohibited writings; it was forbidden to reprint the law of the 22nd
          of May 1815 (that relating to the institution of Estates of the Realm), because of its
          tendency to excite discontent.</p>

        <p>In September 1842, those Prussians who had hoped to see their country under the new king
          shake itself free from its humiliating relations with the Emperor Nicholas, learned that
          Frederick William IV., in Platen's day the warm, if platonic, friend of Poland, the hater
          of Russian tactics, was preparing for a journey to Warsaw to meet the Czar. On the return
          journey the king stopped at Kalisch to inspect the monument erected there in memory of the
          meeting between the sovereigns of Russia and Prussia in 1813. A Russian officer, General
          Berg (the future castigator of Poland), translated the inscriptions for him. One of them
          was: "May the Almighty give His blessing to the alliance and friendship between Russia and
          Prussia, that it may advance the peace and prosperity of both countries and inspire fear
          in their common enemies!" On hearing this inscription read, the king hastened up the steps
          of the monument and in the dust upon its side wrote with his finger the word:
          Amen![12]</p>

        <head>THE NEUTRAL LITERATURE</head>

        <p>Nevertheless, Frederick William IV. was, and remained, the most intellectually gifted
          monarch of his day; his conversation gave evidence of both intelligence and imagination.
          It was a principle with him that all his feelings ought to be kingly; his published
          letters to Humboldt, written in amusing court jargon, are bright and clever; his sayings
          show quickness of apprehension, easily awakened compassion, ready wit.[1] Nor can it be
          said that he was out of touch with the German intellectual life and literature of the day;
          he showed favour to all the "good" writers, and disfavour to the "bad"; but it was not
          long before all Oppositionist writers were included in the latter class.</p>

        <p>In the beginning of the reign, Humboldt's was the dominating literary influence at court.
          Alexander von Humboldt, now eighty, the most famous scientist of the day, and a man of
          world-wide celebrity, kept the king well posted up in all the latest intellectual and
          scientific movements. His brother Wilhelm's liberal political theories had fallen into
          complete disrepute; to his own he dared not give expression at court; holding both
          superstition and reaction in abhorrence, he was a silent witness of much that <pb n="329"
          /> was repugnant to him, though he now and again spoke his mind.[2] Honoured by the king
          and his intimates as the ornament of the court and the pride of his country, he took
          advantage of his position to further the cause of science and to say an occasional helpful
          word for this or that persecuted author. Published letters show that, before 1848, the
          king treated Humboldt with a sort of playful familiarity, though there was no real, deep
          sympathy between the two men. After 1848, when the Kreuzzeitung party became all-powerful,
          Humboldt gave expression to his annoyance at having lost his influence, in such remarks
          as, "It is no longer possible to amuse the king;" or, "the king persists in wasting
          fruitless affection on persons whom he has taken into favour." Amiability was not his
          characteristic at court; he was often sarcastic, and became angry when Ranke's political
          opinions found more favour than his. He was disliked by many, amongst others by the queen,
          who disapproved of his attachment to Louis Philippe and his family. He was in the habit of
          reading aloud all varieties of literature, but never his own writings; most frequently he
          read the _Journal des Débats_, whilst the king sat planning landscapes and architectural
          drawings.</p>

        <p>Another of those who read aloud to the royal family was Tieck, whom the king had brought
          to Berlin from Dresden. Though Tieck was considerably younger than Humboldt, court life
          was a burden to him because of his bodily infirmity. Shakespeare and Kleist were the
          authors he most frequently read from. The king ordered Tieck's own old fairy play, _Puss
          in Boots_, to be performed in Berlin, it was like the appearance of some antiquated
          spectre. At the king's instigation Tieck put the _Antigone_ of Sophocles on the stage, and
          Mendelssohn composed music for it. But Tieck was only one of literature's invalided
          soldiers. When <pb n="330"/> the court dined in the garden of Sans Souci, he was afraid of
          draughts, even on the warmest days.</p>

        <p>Another once famous author of the Romantic period whom the king called to Berlin was La
          Motte Fouqué. Though not much over sixty, this writer had completely outlived his
          reputation. His romances seemed to the younger generation to belong to a pre-historic
          period. People were tired of tales of chivalry and the service of love (_Minnedienst_)
          told in a conventionally childish style; his unhistorical conception of past times and his
          sanctimoniousness aroused derision. Had it not been for the king's support, he would have
          died in want and oblivion.</p>

        <p>In 1841, chiefly on the recommendation of Varnhagen, the king invited to Berlin a great
          poet who did not belong to the Romantic school. This was Friedrich Rückert (1788-1866).
          Rückert was only fifty-three, but he did not belong to the period in which he lived; he
          was the expression in the literature of the day of that German universality which is
          unaffected by circumstances, of the gift of appropriation, absorption and imitation of the
          peculiarities of all other races. All his life long he shook poems out of his sleeve with
          a truly astonishing skill. As a young man he was initiated by Joseph von Hammer into the
          literatures of Arabia, Persia, and Turkey, and in 1826 he was appointed lecturer in
          Oriental languages at the University of Erlangen, but his duties as lecturer he constantly
          tried to evade.</p>

        <p>There is something about him which reminds us of Goethe in the Divan period, and
          something which he owes to the Schlegels and their indefatigable study and translation.
          The essay on philology, _Ueber das Wesen der Philologie_, which he wrote in 1811, shows
          the influence of Friedrich Schlegel's work on the wisdom of ancient India; for he starts
          from the idea of a "universal poetry," for which he considers the German language the most
          sympathetic vehicle. And universal, cosmopolitan poetry is exactly what this great master
          of style has given us. He, as the German patriot, makes his début with _Geharnischte
          Sonnette_ ("Armoured Sonnets"), polished and rather mannered verse. This book is followed
          by volume after volume of love-<pb n="331"/>poems to various young women (five to six
          hundred poems). In the last and largest of these volumes, _Liebesfrühling_, inscribed to
          his fiancée, Louise Witthaus, feeling is predominant; everywhere else he is the didactic
          poet employing lyric forms, here he is the singer. But even here, set forms--as in the
          _Canzonets of the South_--stand in the way of the simple, natural outburst of feeling, and
          already Rückert's inclination to display his mastery over language shows itself in a
          hitherto unexampled free invention of new words and ease in interlacing within the limits
          of metre:</p>

        <p> "Welche Heldenfreudigkeit der Liebe, Welche Stärke muthigen Entsagens, Welche himmlisch
          erdentschwungene Triebe, Welche Gottbegeistrung des Ertragens! Welche Sich-Erhebung,
          Sich-Erwiedrung, Sich-Entäussrung, völl'ge Hin-sich-gebung, Seelenaustausch,
          Ineinanderlebung!"</p>

        <p>There is more of philological and technical than of purely poetical interest in such
          verse as this. But Rückert _was_ the philologist as poet. His predominating gift is the
          gift of language in its two developments--the capacity to learn languages and penetrate
          into their spirit, and the capacity, due to his profound penetration into the mysteries of
          his own language, to reproduce in German the best poetry written in other languages. He
          delighted in creating linguistic difficulties for himself to overcome. At one time we have
          him writing in the old German style that corresponded to his Albrecht Dürer curls, at
          another as a young officer of the time of Napoleon; now he is a Bedouin telling us
          Hariri's tales with marvellous skill, and again a Persian weaving his rhyme in the form of
          Ghazels or recreating the epic of Rustum and Sohrab. He appears before us as a Turk in
          caftan and turban, as a Chinaman with slippers and pig-tail; but most frequently and with
          most pleasure he sits as a Brahmin on the banks of the sacred Ganges, proclaiming in
          sonorous verse the thousand golden rules of a happy philosophy of life. It is said of
          Théophile Gautier that he was, intellectually speaking, equally at home in ancient Egypt,
          in the Russia of to-day, <pb n="332"/> in Constantinople, and in Seville. This is only
          true to the extent that he was well acquainted with the climatic characteristics and the
          monuments of many foreign lands. It may be said with much profounder truth of Rückert, who
          comprehended the human beings through their literatures, understood their language and
          thought in their spirit. He never saw the foreign lands with his bodily eyes, therefore he
          has neither Gautier's colour, nor his power of graphic presentation; he views them all
          calmly, reflectively, with the eye of the mind, and gives us the mental pictures in an
          astonishing variety of metrical forms. Whoever desires to make acquaintance with excellent
          specimens of his art should read _Hariri's Makamehs_ (more particularly the division
          entitled _Jungfrau und Junge Frau_) or _Weisheit der Bramanen_.</p>

        <p>These works had gained Rückert a wide circle of readers and admirers in Berlin; but the
          town, with its restlessness, was antipathetic to him. He was to lecture on Oriental
          languages at the university, and his first lectures were attended by a curious crowd; but
          this crowd soon dwindled down to an audience of two or three, and Rückert gave up going to
          the university. He sat in his room in the third flat of a house in the Behrenstrasse and
          wrote poems in which he expressed his detestation of Berlin and its agitated, modern life.
          Even the Berlin of the royal romanticist was too modern for these celebrities of past
          days.</p>

        <p>At a somewhat later date the king extended his patronage to Christian Scherenberg, whose
          poems, more especially the battle-pieces _Waterloo_ and _Abukir_, were much admired at
          court--the author himself had to read them aloud. Even as an octogenarian, Scherenberg
          retained his place as a favourite in Berlin society. He was born in 1798. His life had
          been a hard struggle. After the dissolution of his unhappy marriage, he lived, from 1833
          to 1840, in rooms in a small house at the corner of the Bendlerstrasse, looking towards
          the Zoological Gardens, in such poverty that he could not afford to buy firewood, and had
          to send his children to gather sticks in the Gardens. He wrote poems, tragedies, and
          comedies, for which he could never find a <pb n="333"/> publisher; nevertheless he was so
          successful in his attempts to keep up the appearance of a gentleman, that his relations in
          Stettin believed he had won fame under an assumed name, and begged him to "remove his
          mask" and let them into the secret. All that his pen brought him was what he received for
          composing begging letters and for copying; the rest of his living he gained by acting as
          tutor to the families of the gardeners who lived in the neighbourhood, giving lessons
          which, according to agreement, were paid for in potatoes. A pretty story is told by
          Fontane in his _Life of Scherenberg_. Great hopes had been entertained in the
          Bendlerstrasse that a certain long-deferred payment would be made at Easter in the shape
          of a juicy roast of veal; but in place of this, the pupil, in his innocent desire to give
          pleasure, appeared with a lark in a little green cage. On Easter morning, 1840,
          Scherenberg himself carried the cage out to an open field, set the lark free, and wrote
          the sweet poem, one verse of which runs:</p>

        <p> "Du, Vöglein, singst, das ist das Deine, Hub leise ich zur Lerche an, Ich geb' dich
          frei, das ist das Meine, Ein Jeder bete, wie er kann."[3]</p>

        <p>The poor, struggling poet let the lark go, but kept its little clay water-dish as a
          remembrance, promoting it to be his ink-pot.</p>

        <p>At last his poems caught the fancy of the public, and the king, delighted with the
          originality and rugged energy of the battle-pieces, took their author into favour. The
          only thing connected with the time when he read aloud at court that Scherenberg could be
          persuaded to talk about, was the pleasure of the half-hour before the reading, spent in
          his friend Count Bismarck-Bohlen's room, where men joked and smoked, and afterwards
          drenched themselves with Eau de Cologne, because the king disliked the smell of tobacco.
          Many years later there was another potentate in <pb n="334"/> Berlin at whose court
          Scherenberg was an attendant. This was Ferdinand Lassalle. At his house the poet met
          livelier companions, in whose society he not infrequently permitted himself to make fun of
          his royal and aristocratic patrons. It was in his nature to suit himself to his company;
          his court friends knew his weakness and excused him.</p>

        <p>Another favourite at the Prussian court, as indeed at all the courts of Europe, was
          Prince Hermann Pückler-Muskau, who from time to time came to Berlin to visit the wife
          whom, though divorced from her, he still loved. He was a handsome man, aristocratic in
          appearance and manners, accomplished and versatile, a favourite with men because of his
          spirit and gaiety, irresistibly charming to women; the list of famous women who were
          devoted to him is a long one; it includes Sophie Gay, Henriette Sontag, Bettina, and Ida
          Hahn-Hahn. In much the same manner as the Prince de Ligne before him, Pückler-Muskau
          belonged, by right of his intellectual qualities, to the international aristocracy of
          Europe. His desire to shine did not lead him to over-estimate his powers, did not even
          preclude real modesty. He was a brilliant vagabond, a master of the art of living, and a
          skilled professional in one department of art strictly so-called, namely, landscape
          gardening. He was the first in Germany to desert the stiff, French style of laying out a
          garden, and to reinstate nature in her rights. His garden at Muskau soon became the model
          garden of Europe.</p>

        <p>There were many strange episodes in his life. Nothing could be much stranger than the
          story of his marriage. He was in love at the same time with two young girls, daughters of
          Count von Pappenheim, whose wife was a daughter of Chancellor Hardenberg. This lady, who
          was forty, nine years older than Pückler, herself conceived such a violent passion for him
          that she infected him with it. She gave up everything to become his, and he married her,
          but with the proviso that he was to be at complete liberty to dispose of his affections as
          he chose. The marriage turned out happily. But after they had lived together for ten years
          the couple amicably arranged a divorce, in the hope that <pb n="335"/> the prince might
          find and marry a rich heiress, and thereby repair his fallen fortunes. With this aim in
          view he first visits London, then travels about in Germany. He writes daily to his
          divorced wife, his Lucie, keeping her faithfully informed of the progress he makes and of
          the difficulties he encounters in his pursuit of an heiress. Unable to capture one, he
          returns to Lucie, and they again live lovingly together for some years. After this he
          travels for six years, returning at the end of that time with a beautiful little slave,
          named Machbuba, whom he instals at Muskau. With this arrangement the princess was not
          altogether satisfied, though she had made it a rule never to plague him with jealousy. At
          the age of seventy she still loved and worshipped him, and in his intercourse with her he
          was always personified kindness, frankness, and cordiality.</p>

        <p>Prince Pückler had never had any serious thought of taking up the profession of author,
          but in 1830 he determined to publish anonymously the letters which he had written to Lucie
          during his travels in search of an heiress. They had a great success. There was a society
          tone about them very uncommon in German literature, an attractive carelessness of
          construction, due to the fact that they were not written for publication, a pleasing
          mixture of wisdom and frivolity. As already mentioned, many ascribed their authorship to
          Heine. Their writer was modern in the extreme, thoroughly _blasé_, an advanced Liberal, a
          freethinker in the literal sense of the word.</p>

        <p>For readers of to-day the four volumes of _Briefe eines Verstorbenen_ ("Letters of a Dead
          Man") have much the same value as Madame de Girardin's attractive five volumes, _Lettres
          parisiennes du Vicomte de Launay_. She is fresher and writes infinitely better than the
          prince. He has cosmopolitan experiences of classes and of countries that she knows nothing
          about. As a specimen of his style, those interested should read the unassuming account of
          his conversation with Goethe in Weimar, to be found in the third volume of the Letters.
          Pückler's enthusiastic reverence for Goethe has a genuine ring, and the same may be said
          of Goethe's answer to Pückler's polite speeches. Goethe at once begins <pb n="336"/> to
          talk about Muskau (referred to in letters as M.), and commends attempts like Pückler's to
          awaken the feeling for beauty, dwells on the fact that the welfare of all would be rapidly
          advanced if only each in his own sphere, great or small, would work faithfully and
          lovingly--that is what Pückler is doing in Muskau, and he himself has done no more.</p>

        <p>Pückler's later volumes of travel, many in number, leave us quite cold. They lack the
          spontaneity of the Letters, and are still more destitute of that which could alone replace
          it, namely, literary talent. But until about the year 1840 they stood as high in the
          favour of the reading public as his first books, and their author's popularity was
          unbounded; he was, like Franz Liszt, known and admired everywhere. As late as 1854 Heine
          dedicates his _Lutetia_ to him in an enthusiastic preface, in which he calls him "mein
          hochgefeierter und wahlverwandter Zeitgenosse" (that highly honoured contemporary, to whom
          I feel myself spiritually akin). And in Varnhagen's diary for July 7, 1839, we read:
          "Prince Pückler's name acts like magic. It needs but to be mentioned, and the great world
          of all countries listens in suspense. His fame is stupendous, and the cleverer men are,
          the more they appreciate him."</p>

        <p>In 1834 Varnhagen had said of him that he possessed one quality in common with Young
          Germany, and that the most important, namely, absolute freedom of thought; at a later
          period he said that Pückler represented the upper house, Heine the lower house in modern
          German literature.</p>

        <p>Pückler's attitude to the House of Hohenzollern was one of chivalrous devotion. He never
          came to Berlin without waiting on the king. He appreciated Frederick William IV.'s culture
          and wit, but, being a pronounced Voltairean, to whom every priest was a hypocrite and all
          vague piety an abomination, the romantic strain in the king's character repelled him. Like
          Humboldt he often fled from the court and took refuge with Varnhagen, the keen observer
          and critic, who sat forgotten in his corner, writing in his Journal (a diary kept in
          Sainte-Beuve's manner) the history of the times. And in later years Pückler, too, was a
          regular <pb n="337"/> guest at Lassalle's small dinner-parties, where he often did most of
          the talking; it is said that he was the only person privileged by Lassalle to do
          so.[4]</p>

        <p>To the authors already named we have only to add the aged Arndt, who in his day had been
          persecuted as a demagogue, and we have the complete list of the romantic, conservative,
          neutral, or aristocratic writers whom the most powerful king in Germany succeeded in
          attaching to his person. We see the length and the strength of the attachment. The
          Opposition attacked every author who had the very slightest connection with the court or
          with those in power. We have seen how Herwegh begins his first book with a defiant attack
          on Prince Pückler. He jeered even at Arndt--called him a sunset glow, incapable of
          illuminating the young world--and received a poetical reproof from Freiligrath for so
          doing.</p>

        <p>Freiligrath was the only one of the young poets whom the king at once (1841) placed under
          an obligation (Geibel was taken into favour a year or two later). General von Radowitz,
          who admired Freiligrath's poem "Löwenritt," in spite of its unnaturalness, induced the
          king to look favourably on its author and to grant him a pension of 300 thalers. Herwegh,
          not content with making merry at Freiligrath's expense in such lines as the following,
          where _Freiligrath_ is substituted for _Mühlenrad_ (mill-wheel):</p>

        <p> "Mir wird von alle dem so dumm, Als ging mir ein Freiligrath im Kopf herum,"[5]</p>

        <p>wrote in his _Duett der Pensionirten_:</p>

        <p> "_Geibel_: Bist du's? _Freiligrath_: Ja, willst du mich kennen? Ja, ich bin es in der
          That, Den Bediente Bruder nennen Bin der Sänger Freiligrath."[6]</p>

        <p><pb n="338"/> This was more than Freiligrath could stand. He threw up his pension, a step
          which was soon followed by his complete conversion. His volumes, _Ein Glaubensbekenntniss_
          ("A Confession of Faith"), published in 1844, and _Ça ira_, published in 1846, show a
          steadily increasing passion of devotion to the revolutionary cause. He became the most
          honoured poet of the party. Immediately after the publication of _Ein Glaubensbekenntniss_
          he was obliged to flee the country, going first to Brussels and then to London, where he
          earned his livelihood as a merchant.</p>

        <p>The following anecdote shows how popular he already was: From Brussels he had taken an
          excursion to Antwerp. There he and his friends went on board a barque that was lying in
          the river, ready to sail for Canton. While the boatswain was showing them over the ship,
          the captain, with some friends, came out of the cabin. Freiligrath's party made many
          excuses, but the courteous sailor bade them welcome, and invited them into the cabin. On
          one of the shelves of the little book-case stood Freiligrath's Poems. "Are you not pleased
          that your poems are going out to Canton?" asks one of his companions. "Eh!" says the
          captain. "This is Freiligrath? The real Freiligrath?" On his question being answered in
          the affirmative, the captain rushes to the speaking-tube: "Hoist the flags! Man the yards!
          and serve champagne on deck!"[7]</p>

        <p>The fermentation throughout Germany was rapidly becoming more violent. Ever since 1842
          the Hungarians under Kossuth had been defying Metternich; in Bavaria the prestige of
          royalty had suffered from King Ludwig's amour with the ballet-dancer, Lola Montez; in
          German Switzerland the Radical and Jesuit parties were engaged in stern conflict. In
          Prussia the authority of the State Church was being vigorously asserted; Roman Catholicism
          was favoured, but all other dissenters were harassed. It was not only the Free-Catholics,
          a sect founded by Ronge, and the so-called Friends of Light, another free sect, founded by
          Wislicenus, that were regarded with disfavour; even Pietists were objected to, as not
          orthodox enough to <pb n="339"/> suit the State requirements. One protest after another
          reached the king from those whose liberty in matters of conscience was threatened. And
          purely political agitation was on the increase too. The leaders of the opposition parties
          in all the States of Germany decried with one voice the old Federal constitution
          (_Bundesverfassung_). Louder and louder rose the cry in Prussia (the king having laid no
          great restrictions on the liberty of the press) for the promised new constitution. From
          abroad too came revolutionary impulses. Since 1846 Pius IX. had been giving himself out as
          a Liberal and an Italian patriot. Insurrections were breaking out all over Italy;
          Metternich was unable to prevent them, and they were destroying his prestige. German
          emigrants in Switzerland and North America did their best to fan the flame in Germany.</p>

        <p>Meantime the King of Prussia occupied himself with the institution of the new Order of
          the Swan and with architectural plans. He proposed the erection of a great Hermann
          monument on the Rhine, as a demonstration against constitutional France; and he set the
          builders to work again on the Cathedral of Cologne, after a pause of 300 years. This
          latter undertaking was considered symbolical, not from the national but from the
          ecclesiastical point of view. It gave Heine occasion for various protests and erroneous
          prophecies in _Deutschland, ein Wintermärchen_, and also gave occasion to Strauss's clever
          pamphlet, _Der Romantiker auf dem Trone der Cäsaren_, in which he manages to describe
          Julian the Apostate as the enthusiastic religious reactionary, in such a way that the
          parallel with Frederick William IV. suggests itself without being pointed out.</p>

        <p>The new literature, to which the king was distinctly inimical, soon began to return his
          enmity with interest. He established Tieck, the fretful, crippled old man, at Sans Souci
          as poet-laureate, and Schelling, the mystifier, in Berlin as _summus philosophus_. He
          caused the _Antigone_ of Sophocles and the _Medea_ of Euripides to be performed in the
          theatres of Berlin and Potsdam, in hopes of thereby counteracting the spirit of unrest in
          German literature. But that literature went its own way.</p>

        <p>[1] Examples of Frederick William's style of wit: When the king was at the play, lackeys
          stood in attendance outside the door of the royal box. One evening, when his Majesty,
          provoked by the tiresomeness of a new play, left his box before the close of the
          performance, he found one of the lackeys sitting on the floor of the passage, sound
          asleep, his head leant against the wall of the box. Instead of being angry, the king said:
          "Der hat gehorcht" (means both: He has listened, and: He has obeyed). In 1848, in the
          palmy days of the Revolution, the king was obliged to receive one deputation after
          another, sometimes of very pretentious and presumptuous common people. He addressed the
          members of one such deputation, one after the other. What are you?--A silk and woollen
          cloth warehouseman, your Majesty.--Most interesting occupation. And you?--A medical
          student.--Excellent preparation for taking part in the government of the country! And so
          on, all the time with a most polite, if ironical, smile. (Told me by an eye-witness.)</p>

        <p>[2] The king was at one time deeply interested in the mysteries of table-turning, but it
          was long before any of the palace tables could be persuaded to perform, a fact which did
          not surprise Humboldt. At last the king received him one morning with the exclamation:
          "Aha! what do you say now? We sat round the table for a full half-hour last night before
          it would move, but at last off it went, round and round, faster and faster. How do you
          explain that?" "Why, your Majesty, in all disputes it's the wiser of the two that gives
          in." (Related by Humboldt himself.)</p>

        <p>[3]</p>

        <p> O little bird, to sing 'tis thine, gently to the lark began; I set thee free, that deed
          is mine; We all must pray as best we can.</p>

        <p>[5] All that is going on makes me as stupid as if a mill-wheel (a Freiligrath) were
          turning in my head.</p>

        <p>POLITICAL POETRY, PHILOSOPHICAL REVOLUTION</p>

        <p>In Anastasius Grün's (Count Alexander von Auersperg's) volume, _Spaziergänge eines Wiener
          Poeten_ ("Walks of a Viennese Poet"), there is a poem, the title and the refrain of which
          is: Why? When new prohibitory enactments are pasted on the notice-board at the town-hall,
          a little man comes and reads them and quietly asks: Why? When the priests from their
          pulpits groan and howl at the sunlight, he asks: Why? When men go out to fight sparrows
          with halberts and spears, and use cannons to shoot larks, he asks: Why? And when they try,
          condemn, and execute himself, from his very grave is heard the question: Why?</p>

        <p>Something of this kind happened in Germany as soon as the patriarchal faith in monarchy
          was thoroughly shaken. When an act of violence, or a stupid act, or a subterfuge on the
          part of the Government killed a hope, out of the grave of that hope grew a Why. And every
          Why gave birth to others. The four questions of the East-Prussian were inadequate now;
          questions grew and multiplied like those invisible but dangerous animals which in an
          incredibly short time can undermine an organism. Why revere? Why trust? Why endure? And,
          first and foremost, why keep silence? When they are going to shake off the yoke, men begin
          by refusing to bear it silently. Suffering and wrath, desire and longing, now found vent
          in words, in song.</p>

        <p>Political verse, of which there had been occasional specimens among the work of Platen
          and Lenau, Uhland and Heine, now concentrates and crystallises itself into a separate
          species of poetry, a separate form of art. Political song of every variety is heard
          throughout the land. It is <pb n="341"/> a time of growth; men of talent come to the
          surface in crowds--Hoffmann and Herwegh, Dingelstedt and Prutz, Freiligrath and Max
          Waldau, Karl Beck and Mofitz Hartmann--such a rich and fragant bloom as had never been
          seen in this domain before. Old Romanticists expressed their contempt for prose (_i.e._
          political) poetry, dogmatic æsthetes declared these poets to be possessed of rhetoric and
          not of lyric talent; but all to no purpose; the very number of them, and the way in which
          they spontaneously fell into position as a group, showed that they had the very best, the
          only unchallengeable reason for coming into existence, namely, that they could not help
          it, that the spirit of the times was making its voice heard through them; and soon they
          also proved that they possessed the one and only right to exist, for they were able to
          hold their ground, they took their position as literary men, and gained the popular
          ear.</p>

        <p>They had had a single forerunner in the Thirties, the above-mentioned Austrian poet,
          Alexander Auersperg. His verse was imposing, somewhat overloaded with imagery, at times
          wanting in taste; nevertheless it had the true ring, and his pathos was genuine. Joseph
          II. is Auersperg's hero, and it is from the "enlightenment" standpoint that he regards
          that political liberty which he so eagerly desires. It is the power of the priesthood that
          specially arouses his wrath; but he distinguishes between _Pfaffen_ and _Priester_,
          attacks the worthless and sings the praises of the high-minded among the clergy. Upon
          lines like:</p>

        <p> "Stoss in's Horn, Herold des Krieges: Zu den Waffen, zu den Waffen! Kampf und Krieg der
          argen Horde heuchlerischer, dummer Pfaffen!"[1]</p>

        <p>follow others which extol the virtues of the really saintly priests. Still we feel that
          in his opinion more of the former than of the latter are to be found in his own day. He
          regards it as one of the signs of the times that the fat, animal priest has been succeeded
          by the lean, intelligent, ambitious one:</p>

        <p><pb n="342"/> _Die Dicken und die Dünnen._</p>

        <p> "Fünfzig Jahre sind's, da riefen unsere Aeltern zu den Waffen, Krieg und Kampf den
          dicken, kugelrunden, feisten Pfaffen! Auch in Waffen stehn wir Enkel; jetzt doch muss die
          Lösung sein: Krieg und Kampf den dünnen, magern, spindelhagern Pfäffelein!"[2]</p>

        <p>In spirited verse the courageous poet attacked now Metternich, now the detective police,
          now the censorship. His poems display a frank, vigorous spirit of opposition, no hatred,
          no wild resentment; one feels that they are animated by anticipation of a glorious future
          and enthusiasm for the great men of the past. But Auersperg's plastic power is slight; he
          too often loses himself in a maze of allegory. The best of the political poetry of the
          Forties is, both intellectually and artistically, much superior to his.</p>

        <p>About a year after his famous journey, from the effects of which he had completely
          recovered, Georg Herwegh published a second volume of _Gedichte eines Lebendigen_ ("Poems
          of a Living Man"), in which some new and valuable qualities are combined with those
          characterising the first. There is more confidence and more fire, and both enthusiasms and
          animosities are less vague. We have fewer illusions, and a clearer understanding of ends
          and means; no more appeals to a king to lead the onward march of his people, or to God to
          give freedom and happiness to all the nations of the earth. Frederick William IV. had
          extinguished Herwegh's faith in princes, and Ludwig Feuerbach his faith in God. But we
          gain the impression that the dawning light in men's minds has broadened into the light of
          day.</p>

        <p>In the old dawn-songs, which Shakespeare has imitated in _Romeo and Juliet_, the young
          girl always tries to keep her lover with her by declaring that it is not sunlight but
          moonlight that he sees, not the lark but the nightingale that he hears. This idea is
          cleverly reversed in the poem _Morgenzuruf_ ("Cry of the Morning"):</p>

        <p><pb n="343"/> "Die Lerche war's, nicht die Nachtigall, Die eben am Himmel geschlagen:
          Schon schwingt er sich auf, der Sonnenball, Vom Winde des Morgens getragen. Der Tag, der
          Tag ist erwacht! Die Nacht, Die Nacht soll blutig verenden. Heraus wer an's ewige Licht
          noch glaubt, Ihr Schläfer, die Rosen der Liebe vom Haupt, Und ein flammendes Schwert um
          die Lenden!"[3]</p>

        <p>_Unglückliche Liebe_ ("Unhappy Love") is an epigram pointed against kings:</p>

        <p> "Nicht an den Königen liegt's--die Könige lieben die Freiheit, Aber die Freiheit liebt
          leider die Könige nicht."[4]</p>

        <p>The tone of Herwegh's previous volume, even in its apparently irreligious utterances, had
          been theistic. On the adjuration to tear the crosses from the graves and use them as
          swords, follows the line: "God forgives the deed ye do." But in this new volume we find a
          poem in which Feuerbach's praises are sung because he has attacked the doctrine of
          immortality, and a Song of the Heathen, which is more daring in its mockery than any
          similar poem of Heine's:</p>

        <p> "Die Heiden--'s ist doch Schade um solch Ingenium. Sie hiessen Vier gerade und nahmen
          Fünf für krumm. Auch hatt' die Jungfernschaft ein End, sobald die Magd ein Kind gebar,
          Dieweil das neue Testament noch nicht erfunden war."</p>

        <p>And, unlike Auersperg, who makes a distinction between the good and the bad priest,
          Herwegh holds the whole brotherhood in derision, mocks at Catholic and Protestant, shorn
          and unshorn, in the witty, untranslatable epigram:</p>

        <p> "Ob sie katholisch geschoren, ob protestantisch gescheitelt, Gleichviel--immer geräth
          man den Gesellen in's Haar."</p>

        <p><pb n="344"/> He had pricked before, now he stung; the singer of liberty had developed
          into a herald and preparer of the approaching revolution.</p>

        <p>If these powerful poems did not greatly move men's minds, it is to be ascribed to the
          fact that the deficiencies of Herwegh's personal character were subtly influencing his
          verse. They betray themselves in a certain straining after effect, in his evident
          satisfaction with his own witty sallies, and in his intellectual barrenness in every
          domain except that of polemics. This second volume of poems is not a collection which
          suggests that its author has any store of ideas, of imagination, to draw upon. When we
          read it, we understand his life; and his life helps us to understand this book, with which
          his career as a poet practically came to a close. All that he subsequently wrote, and he
          lived for thirty-two years longer, is contained in one small volume, published after his
          death. The poems of this last collection are full of wit and full of enthusiasm for
          liberty; they are written--hardly four in the year--by a man who to the day of his death
          remained faithful to his revolutionary youth.</p>

        <p>Though faithful enough to his past, Herwegh was no worker in the service of liberty. The
          latter part of his life was spent in idleness. His career as a poet and critic began in
          1839[5] and culminated with _Gedichte eines Lebendigen_. He married a rich young Jewess,
          an enthusiastic admirer of his poetry. After the Revolution of February he took up the
          position of a leader in Paris, and invaded Baden at the head of a body of republican
          German and French workmen; on the 27th of April they were defeated by Würtembergian
          troops; thanks to his wife's courage, Herwegh escaped. Heine has given a bitingly
          sarcastic, but very unfair description of this campaign in _Simplicissimus I._ The simple,
          truthful account which Herwegh's wife has published since, of all the incidents of the
          revolt, and of the part which her husband played in it, proves that, even if he lacked the
          tactical skill which he laid no claim to possessing, he was a brave man. Herwegh now
          became a member of the <pb n="345"/> emigrant colony in London, and lived the emigrants'
          perniciously idle life; they had literally nothing to do but concoct futile plans for new
          revolutions and fall in love with one another's wives. He afterwards lived in Paris and
          Zürich, always the same inactive life, persistently dissatisfied with the progress of
          events in Germany. Like Kinkel and like Moritz Hartmann, Herwegh was unable to the day of
          his death (1875) to reconcile himself to the great development of power attained by
          Germany at the expense of liberty. He never relinquished the ideals of his youth; retained
          a manly admiration even for Heine, who had held him up to derision.</p>

        <p>Being such as he was, it was only natural that Herwegh should from the very first be on
          the watch in the matter of his brother poets' fidelity to their flag and the genuineness
          of their liberalism. His attacks on Geibel and Freiligrath have already been noticed. He
          next turned upon Anastasius Grün (Auersperg), who had gone to Vienna in hopes of obtaining
          the appointment and rank of Chamberlain; his wife, by birth a Countess Attems, was
          invested with the Order of the Star of the Cross, and he wished to be able to accompany
          her to court. In stirring words Herwegh entreated him to retrace his steps:</p>

        <p> "Darf man den Tempel um ein Weib entweih'n, Mit einem Weib um goldne Götzen tanzen,"
          &amp;c[6]</p>

        <p>Dingelstedt retorted, defending Count Auersperg in a pretty poem:</p>

        <p> "O, sie will es nie begreifen, ihre Prosa und Gemeinheit, Das ein Geist wie Du, ein
          Name, bürgt für der Gesinnung Reinheit, Nur das Schlechte glaubt sie willig,"
          &amp;c.[7]</p>

        <p>The retort evaded the attack instead of repulsing it. No one seriously believed in a man
          like Auersperg having changed his convictions; the ground of Herwegh's attack <pb n="346"
          /> was that, holding such convictions, he had solicited a court appointment. It was his
          own future position that Dingelstedt defended; he was the next poet upon whom Herwegh
          turned, with a satire that was all the fiercer because it was silent, or at least only
          indirectly expressed.</p>

        <p>Dingelstedt, like Herwegh, had been obliged to leave Germany to escape the consequences
          of writing political poems. The two poets met in Paris. There they one evening amused
          themselves by trying which could write the better verses on the subject of his own
          imaginary political conversion. Herwegh wrote the poem "Wohlgeboren" the burden of which
          is: What is the use of all this talk of liberty and fatherland, of all this enthusiasm,
          all this meddling with politics? What good has it done me? No, no! for the future I will
          be a quiet, respectable citizen:</p>

        <p> "Du sollst, verdammte Freiheit, mir Die Ruhe fürder nicht gefährden; Lisette, noch ein
          Gläschen Bier! Ich will ein guter Bürger werden."[8]</p>

        <p>This last line forms the refrain of all the verses. To outbid his friend, Dingelstedt
          wrote the poem "Hochwohlgeboren," which begins:</p>

        <p> "Ein guter Bürger willst du werden? Pfui Freund!--Ein guter, Bürger--Du? Das also war
          dein Ziel auf Erden, Dem stürmten deine Lieder zu? O nimm's zurück, das ekle Wort, Wer mag
          sich so gemein geberden! Nein, nein, mich reisst es weiter fort: Ich muss Geheimer Hofrath
          werden!"[9]</p>

        <p>In this poem, too, the last line of the first verse serves as refrain to all the
          others.</p>

        <p>Two years later Dingelstedt was Privy Councillor, <pb n="347"/> librarian, and reader at
          the court of the King of Würtemberg. Herwegh contented himself with reprinting the two
          poems side by side.</p>

        <p>Franz Dingelstedt (born in 1814) represents one of the most curious types of the day. He
          is a revolutionary who ought to have been born in the purple, a Prince Pückler in the
          guise of a poor schoolmaster, a satirist who cannot dispense with appearances, a man of
          first-rate abilities with neither serious vices nor serious enthusiasm, but with ready wit
          and frequent poetic inspiration; early _blasé_, he retains a certain practical activity of
          mind to the last. He was born in the worst-governed country in Germany, Hesse-Cassel,
          under the hated administration of Hassenpflug, became master at one of its
          grammar-schools, aroused dissatisfaction by his emancipated opinions and conduct and the
          liberal tone of his poetry, was transferred and perpetually interfered with, and sent in
          his resignation in 1841, when he was twenty-seven. Only one year after Herwegh he
          published his first collection of political poetry, _Lieder eines kosmopolitischen
          Nachtwächters_ ("Songs of a Cosmopolitan Night-Watchman"). Good verse, clever poems, a
          good idea. The watchman in his uniform, armed with his spiked mace, his horn in his hand,
          goes his nightly round, and, pausing outside the houses, tells us what he sees and
          imagines within.</p>

        <p>He is a genuine night-watchman--thoroughly weary of the old woman at home, who is so ugly
          and so wrinkled, yet with whom he manages to live peaceably, for she sleeps by night and
          he by day; a genuine night-watchman, who sings the watchman's song about lights and fires;
          looks up at the prisoners, the political prisoners, peering through the iron bars and
          shaking them; shudders as he passes the cathedral with all its relics, where the wind is
          howling so loud in the organ pipes; and then laughs at himself for shuddering. It is
          twenty years since he was inside the building, he is none of your seat-holding
          church-goers.</p>

        <p>And yet he is not a genuine night-watchman. He has feelings and opinions which are not
          those of a man in his station. In one house a ball is going on; he listens to the music,
          and describes the dancing and the behaviour of the <pb n="348"/> fashionable company. What
          a sensation it would create if he, lantern and mace in hand, snow on his cloak and cap,
          his cheeks burning and frost on his beard, were suddenly to appear among all these
          shadows! Outside another house stands the carriage of the great, the all-powerful,
          Minister of State. The coachman is wrapped in furs, but the poor uncovered horses are
          trembling with cold whilst their master is playing cards within--just as if they could not
          revenge themselves when he comes:</p>

        <p> "Ich rathe dir, lass die Karten ruhn, Und hüte dich fein, Ministerlein! Du hast es mit
          vier Hengsten zu thun, Bedenk', dass es keine Bürger sein."[10]</p>

        <p>There are many pathetic passages. In one of the suburbs the watchman passes a house where
          a poor wretch lies in his last agonies; he passes the lunatic asylum, and the dread of
          madness that always seizes him here is mingled with a strange feeling of attraction; he
          passes the cemetery, where his poor father, who took his own life, lies in a disdained,
          neglected corner; and on his way back he passes the palace, where the prince tosses
          sleeplessly on his pillow of down, while the sentry sleeps soundly standing in his
          box.</p>

        <p>A night-watchman might easily have had some of these feelings--he would never have
          expressed them thus; the mask is perpetually falling off. There are one or two most
          masterly and natural expressions of popular indignation, for example the tirade occasioned
          by the sight of light in the sickroom of a cringing courtier whose extortions have
          impoverished his country:</p>

        <p> "Warum er nicht schläft? warum er in Wuth die Spitzen am Hemde zerissen? Ein gutes
          Gewissen schläft überall gut, und nirgends ein schlechtes Gewissen. Er hat an des Landes
          Mark, die Schlang', sich voll gefressen, gesogen, Er hat--ein Menschenleben
          lang!--gestohlen, gelogen, betrogen."[11]</p>

        <p><pb n="349"/> But there are also expressions of hatred and exasperation which we feel
          belong to another class of society. We actually find the watchman giving frivolous advice
          to a beautiful young lady who has been married to an old reprobate, telling her how she
          may best revenge herself upon him. At times his thoughts and reveries take a higher
          flight. He is leaning on an old cannon, which stands on the rampart, shining and dumb.
          Once its wheels rolled over dead and living on the field of victory; once it gave the
          signal for the dread onslaught, for beside the touch-hole there is an N. surmounted by the
          imperial crown. Now its voice is only heard when some wretched prisoner has escaped from
          his dungeon, or on the occasion of his Majesty's birthday, or when a princess is born.
          "Patience!" cries the watchman to the cannon; "it may be that ere long thou wilt once more
          pour thy balls upon the enemy; but keep silent in the meantime, old veteran, or they will
          spike thee as they are gagging us." Here the mask is completely thrown off.</p>

        <p>After Dingelstedt had left Hesse-Cassel, he published _Nachtwächters Weltgang_ ("The
          Night-Watch man's World Patrol"), in which the poet is no longer the unsophisticated
          night-watchman--but the cultivated revolutionary. He falls foul of bad kings, of the
          governments of Hesse-Cassel, Prussia, and Hanover, and of false German patriotism: "What,
          gentlemen, is a German patriot?--A man who serves the Lord on Sunday and the king on
          week-days. What are the objects of his desire?--Office, a title, and a ribbon for himself,
          bread for his lawful offspring, and legitimate sovereigns for his country.--Away with you,
          German patriot! The temple is no place for you! You are a Judas, whose treacherous kiss
          has been the death of liberty!"</p>

        <p>A few months later Dingelstedt was a Privy Councillor and Councillor of Legation--held
          office, had a title, wore a ribbon. Naturally no one believed in any genuine conversion,
          and it is not surprising that his conduct was severely, and in some quarters spitefully,
          judged. The numerous documents relating to his character and life which have <pb n="350"/>
          been published of late years (especially Julius Rodenberg's articles in the _Deutsche
          Rundschau_ of 1889-90) throw a more favourable light upon his action than that in which
          his contemporaries saw it. There was a want of fine feeling about it, it was unseemly, but
          it was not base. There was nothing wrong in the actual fact of his accepting the post of
          reader to a cultivated and amiable sovereign, the fault lay in his having so shortly
          beforehand proclaimed all sorts of democratic and radical principles which he was not
          prepared to stand by.</p>

        <p>He had the true artist's temperament, and yet was distinctly practical; he was
          pleasure-loving and ambitious, unable to bear permanently the humiliation of being poor
          and consequently ignored; he was above all else impressed, strongly impressed, by the
          belief that in following the path he had entered upon he was pursuing a _métier de dupe_.
          What did he gain by refusing, because of his principles, to accept good appointments and
          influential positions! What did the world gain by clever men on principle leaving titles,
          money, office, orders, and posts of honour to the stupid men! Was this the best way to
          improve matters? His great desire was to play the sovereign in some domain of art, to
          solve great scenic problems, to direct great theatres, to be the favoured of beautiful
          women. Was he at all likely to attain it as the exiled schoolmaster, the correspondent of
          the _Allgemeine Zeitung?_ Who would permanently hold in esteem the poor, independent
          journalist? who would not, in course of time, esteem the influential courtier? Of course
          there would be an outcry when he accepted the call--if only he had not written that
          wretched poem to Herwegh!--but what was needed was cool courage, ironical impenetrability,
          smiling indifference, and the calm superiority which allows one's opponents to bawl till
          they are tired; and these gifts he possessed.</p>

        <p>He became, as every one knows, not only a courtier, but in course of time manager of one
          court theatre after another--Stuttgart, Munich, Weimar--ending his career as the
          influential director of the Burgtheater in Vienna.</p>

        <p><pb n="351"/> Heine, who was not strict, but witty, wrote the incomparable poem
          "Verhofrätherei," which begins:</p>

        <p> "Verschlechtert sich nicht dein Herz und dein Stil, So magst du treiben jedwedes Spiel,
          Mein Freund, ich werde dich nie verkennen, Und soll ich dich auch Herr Hofrath
          nennen,"[12]</p>

        <p>It expresses a mournful understanding of Dingelstedt's conduct, and bitter contempt for
          the public to whom both he and Dingelstedt addressed themselves.</p>

        <p>Any one who desires to get a distinct and correct idea of Dingelstedt's intellectual
          personality should compare the clever, graphic account of his life, entitled _Münchener
          Bilderbuch_, with his own cyclus of poems entitled _Ein Roman_. These poems show us far
          more of his inmost nature than the verses of his early youth. But he had early experienced
          the mingled feeling of attraction to the great world and contempt for it. In the poem
          "Krähwinkel," he wrote of fashionable society:</p>

        <p> "Sie lügen, sie krakehlen, sie hassen sich bis auf's Blut, Zum Morden oder Stehlen fehlt
          ihnen nur der Muth. Sie möchten gern und wagen's nicht, das heisst denn Recht und Pflicht;
          Die denken können, sagen's nicht. Die Meisten denken nicht."[13]</p>

        <p>Now he tells the story of a society amour. In England, at a ball, the poet meets a lady
          of Hindoo blood, but English in every other respect. She is spiritually akin to himself,
          gloomy and cold and weary of life. They fall in love:</p>

        <p> "Wir klammerten uns, ob aus Zeitvertreib, Ob aus Verzweiflung, an einander an, Sie, ein
          verlornes, neugebornes Weib, Ich, ein verlorner, neugeborner Mann."[14]</p>

        <p><pb n="352"/> The word "Zeitvertreib" (pastime) is a little too weak, the word
          "Verzweiflung" (despair) is a shade too strong. There is German puerility in this
          insistence upon fashionable frivolity and blank despair. So much is certain; the two fall
          in love. We have plenty of passion, hot and wild--more of sensuality in it than love,
          voluptuous nights, secret pleasures, and coldly cynical front shown to the world; then
          separation, farewell, and oblivion; until one day in a conservatory in Amsterdam the
          decaying smell of a dead lotus-plant makes him feel faint. He is reminded of her, and
          presses one of the dead leaves to his lips as if it were the hand of a corpse.</p>

        <p>Such characters as Dingelstedt significantly illustrate their age, they do not create it.
          They are not the builders of the palace, they are its gilders. No doubt the work of the
          gilder first attracts the eye, and attracts far more eyes than the work of the builder,
          who in laying the foundation of the palace determines its whole construction; but there is
          also no doubt as to whose work is of the more importance.</p>

        <p>These pleasure-loving poets, often disillusioned so young, with no principles except the
          political convictions of which they sing and boast, and to which they generally prove
          unfaithful, are of social importance from the fact that they create the opinion of the
          moment, general political opinion, and thereby accelerate the slow reorganisation of
          society. But this outward reorganisation is not itself the principal matter; political
          opinion is not the prime mover. The outward revolution is a result of movements going on
          much deeper below the surface. Perhaps the most powerful impulse is given by philosophy
          with its quiet revolutionising of the religious view of life.</p>

        <p>In this domain of philosophic agitation there appeared in the summer of 1841 (the year in
          which Dingelstedt's first book was published, the year following the publication of
          Herwegh's first) an epoch-making thinker. In the work entitled _Das Wesen des
          Christenthums_ ("The Nature of Christianity") he formulates great thoughts, founds and
          expounds a philosophy of life which makes its influence <pb n="353"/> felt in the spoken
          and written words of all who come after him, all at least whose minds attain their fullest
          development. Ludwig Feuerbach is the foundation-stone upon which for the next twenty years
          every one builds, everything is built.</p>

        <p>When I say of him that he was great, a great man and a great thinker, I myself resent the
          platitude. Great is a term which we hear so constantly applied to this, that, and the
          other thing, that we have come to be unaffected by it. There is not even any very keen
          appreciation among us of the quality of greatness. The sense for it is deadened by the
          cold, clammy manner in which the intellectually great are handled by those who write
          learned treatises on their work. Take up a history of philosophy, and you will find them
          all arranged and labelled, one looking exactly like the other. There they stand in a row,
          all treated with the same respect, and regarded with the same interest--Schelling, who was
          a genius and a charlatan; Trendelenburg, who accepted his appointment from Eichhorn and
          improved his opportunities after the death of Altenstein; Strauss, who was a second-rate
          thinker, and a bit of a pedant; Karl Vogt, who was a gifted gourmand; Lotze, who was an
          excellent professor of philosophy, but nothing more; and amongst the rest Feuerbach, one
          of a list, possibly labelled as inferior, onesided men, calling themselves ideal realists
          or something of the sort. The effect is demoralising.</p>

        <p>He was great. This means that there is a wide, open space round him on every side. It
          means that if we would understand him, we must separate him clearly in our minds from all
          those men, all those facts that jostle him in lesson-books and hand-books. That he was
          great means, that he is altogether upon another level. The moment we catch sight of him as
          he stands there alone, reverence takes possession of us.</p>

        <p>Simply natural as he was in intercourse with friends, there was yet something
          awe-inspiring about the man. Look at that face, in every feature of which there is genius
          and character--obstinate, energetic character. There is character in the mighty brow, in
          the small eyes, in the big, <pb n="354"/> fan-shaped beard. There is power in it all,
          power and nobility, and manly beauty, stern as though cast in bronze.</p>

        <p>Himself a genius, he belongs to a notably talented family; the father one of the most
          distinguished criminal jurists of Germany; brother, sister, nephew, all gifted. He is born
          at Landshut in 1804; studies at Heidelberg; turns his attention to theology, first from
          the orthodox, afterwards from the critical standpoint; then to philosophy, first abstract,
          afterwards realistic, ever more realistic. He publishes his _Gedanken über Tod und
          Unsterblichkeit_ ("Thoughts on Death and Immortality") anonymously. The book is at first
          confiscated, but subsequently allowed to circulate. After it becomes known that he is the
          author, he applies in vain for professional appointments at several of the South German
          universities, and similar attempts made somewhat later in Berlin, France, Switzerland, and
          Greece prove equally fruitless, in spite of the support of noted savants. From 1836
          onwards he lives a retired life in the country--till 1860 at Brückberg, near Ansbach,
          afterwards at Rechenberg, near Nuremberg. In his later years it is the life of a hermit.
          He corresponds with friends of his own class and stamp, and also with men of the people
          (such as Konrad Deubler of the Salzkammergut), who sometimes understand his writings
          better and feel them more deeply than the so-called cultivated class. In 1837 he married
          the love of his youth. It was not without influence on his life that, in the beginning of
          the Forties, a young girl, daughter of one of his friends, was for a time passionately
          attached to him, an attachment which he returned.</p>

        <p>His only course of lectures was delivered in 1848, at Heidelberg, but not at the
          university; there he was dreaded and shunned. In 1842 his friends had tried to get him
          appointed professor at Heidelberg; he at first took kindly to their plan, but afterwards
          frantically opposed it. "To try to make me a professor and that, too, in the ordinary way,
          the way in which any blockhead can be made one ... is to place me on a level with the
          fools that are posing as professors now, is to insult, to disgrace me.... The professor's
          desk is no place for a man with a head like mine. <pb n="355"/> Do you know the proper
          place for my head? Guess! The block: for my brain is as keen and as peremptory as the
          executioner's sword, and I have no desire, no courage to do any deeds but those for which
          men risk the loss of their heads."[15] His friend had been advising him rather to call his
          work _Wesen der Théologie_ than _Wesen des Christenthums_. He answers: "I take no interest
          whatever in the overturning of theology. I concern myself only with great world-entities
          (welthistorische Wesen).... One must deal a mortal blow, must deny on principle. To act
          means to take life--with the determination, if necessary, to give one's own life in
          return."</p>

        <p>This is more resolute language than the poets used; these views are very different from
          theirs. Saint-René Taillandier animadverted on the fact that Feuerbach, holding such
          views, did not take part in the revolutionary movement of 1848. Feuerbach answered: "M.
          Taillandier! When another revolution breaks out and I take part in it, know, to the dismay
          of your godly soul, that that revolution will be victorious; the last day of the monarchy
          and the hierarchy will have come. Alas! I shall not live to take part in that revolution.
          But I am playing an active part in another great and victorious one, the results of which
          will not be evident till centuries have come and gone. For, according to my
          philosophy--which you know nothing about and presume to judge without having
          studied--according to my philosophy, which ignores gods, and, consequently, miracles
          wrought by means of political measures, space and time are necessary conditions of all
          being, all thought, and all action. It was not, as has been asserted in the Bavarian
          Reichsrathskammer, because the Parliament of Frankfort consisted of unbelievers that it
          was such a complete and shameful failure; as a matter of fact the majority of its members
          were believers--and surely God, too, respects a majority; it was a failure because it was
          destitute of the sense of place and time."[16]</p>

        <p>Notwithstanding the number of different stages through <pb n="356"/> which Feuerbach
          passed in his progress towards realism, notwithstanding all that can with justice be said
          of the diversity of the positions he took up, his ground-thought, the key-stone of the
          vaulting upon which the whole rests, is as simple as it is great. It is this: Man cannot
          be conscious of a being that is higher than himself. If it were possible for man to be
          conscious of himself--that is, his being or nature--as finite, compared with another being
          apprehended as infinite, he would by this consciousness limit his own being, _i.e._ deny
          it. His consciousness would extend beyond the limits of his being, which is impossible,
          for consciousness is simply the self-affirmation of being.</p>

        <p>Instead, therefore, of saying with Hegel: Man's consciousness of God is God's
          self-consciousness, we are compelled to say: Man's consciousness of God is man's
          self-consciousness; religion is man's first and indirect self-knowledge.</p>

        <p>It is universally acknowledged that the idea, God, can only be formulated by the aid of
          human predicates--God is love, God is goodness, knowledge, power, &amp;c. The subject here
          is nothing but the personified predicate. The predicate is the original. What religion
          really means is this: Love is divine, _i.e._ of absolute worth, deserving of adoration;
          goodness, knowledge, power are divine.</p>

        <p>Hence belief in a God is belief in man as the essential being.</p>

        <p>The apparent axiom of religion is: I am nothing, measured with God; its real axiom is:
          Everything else is nothing measured with me; everything serves my purposes. By means of
          prayers and miracles, with God as intermediary, I have everything at my disposal. God is
          the creation of man's desire. The main desire of Christianity being unlimited happiness,
          bliss, God is the means whereby bliss is attained, or, more correctly, bliss and God are
          one.</p>

        <p>In a word; theology is anthropology, the theological problem is a psychological
          problem--which Feuerbach has solved in all essentials for all time.</p>

        <p>Viewed thus, his life-work is seen in its unity. Though it is not possible to express the
          whole in a few words, yet <pb n="357"/> it is easy to feel that it is one single great
          thought, for which humanity is his debtor.</p>

        <p>When a young man stands in the Pantheon in Rome, lost in admiration of its dome, the most
          beautiful in the world, his most natural thought is: O, like the builder of this temple,
          to have, were it but once in one's life, an idea, simple and great as that which produced
          this cupola--to conceive some single fundamental principle, some simple and yet composite
          formula, capable of expansion to a whole scheme, of dimensions as grand as this firmament
          in miniature! One such thought, simple in its beginning, stupendous in its development,
          would give greatness enough to any human life.</p>

        <p>Feuerbach's was one of these fundamental thoughts.</p>

        <p>[1] Sound the trumpet, herald of war! To arms! To arms! War to the death with the wicked
          horde of stupid, hypocritical priests!</p>

        <p>[2] Fifty years ago our parents declared war against the fat and flabby priest; we, their
          children and grandchildren, have, like them, taken up arms against the cloth; but our cry
          is: Death to the lean and lanky priestlings!</p>

        <p>[3] 'Tis the lark, not the nightingale, that sings so clear; the great sun-ball is rising
          fast, borne by the winds of the morning. It is day! it is day! The night will end in
          blood. Awake, all ye who believe in the light eternal! Tear the rose-wreaths of love from
          your heads, and gird yourselves with swords of flame!</p>

        <p>[4]</p>

        <p> 'Tis not the fault of the Kings--_they_ are all lovers of freedom; But their misfortune
          is this: Freedom has no love for them.</p>

        <p>[5] His youthful writings are collected in _Gedichte und kritische Aufsätze_, 1845, 2
          vols.</p>

        <p>[6] Would you desecrate the temple for the sake of a woman, dance with her before golden
          idols, &amp;c.</p>

        <p>[7] Prosaic vulgar-mindedness cannot, will not, understand that thy name, a mind like
          thine, is a security for integrity of purpose; it is ready to believe only what is bad,
          &amp;c.</p>

        <p>[8] No longer, damned Liberty, shalt thou disturb my peace of mind. Lisette! another
          glass of beer! For the future I'm a respectable citizen.</p>

        <p>[9] A respectable citizen! You an ordinary respectable citizen! Shame on you, my friend I
          Was this your aim in life? Is this the end of all your passionate song? Take back the
          offensive word, I pray; just imagine displaying such vulgar-mindedness! Mine is a nobler
          ambition: I am determined to be a Privy Councillor!</p>

        <p>[10] My advice to you is to drop the cards and look out for yourself, O minister!
          Remember that you have to do with four stallions, not four citizens!</p>

        <p>[11] You ask me why he lies sleepless? why in his rage he tears the lace from his pillow?
          A good conscience sleeps well everywhere, a bad conscience nowhere. He has sucked the
          blood of his country, gorged himself with its substance; during a whole long life he has

        <head>REVOLUTIONARY POETRY</head>

        <p>The profoundest characteristic of that literature which in the Forties still continued to
          be known by the name of _Bewegungslitteratur_, is its utter want of connection with
          official Germany. It is the absence of any such connection that gives it its strength and
          its freshness. Official Germany is not to be taken here in the narrow sense of German
          officialdom; it means all that part of the people--German or any other--which in normal
          circumstances appears to be the whole people, and as such sets the stamp of nationality on
          all that is produced by that people, the same stamp which it has set on all that has
          emanated from it in the past. With what a later period has called _Bildungsphilisterei_
          (cultured philistinism), the most eminent literary men of the period in question have no
          connection whatever. There is no corresponding group of personalities and writings in
          Scandinavian literature. Even the Radical poetry of the Scandinavian students became
          official in the course of a very few years. The most gifted of the German poets of the day
          are independent, or make themselves independent, of official Germany, and bear like men
          the consequences of the position they take up.</p>

        <p>Among those who declare their independence, the most interesting figure is Freiligrath,
          born in Detmold in 1810. Fair, blue-eyed, massively built, and shaggy-maned, he is the
          true son of Westphalia. His father, a schoolmaster, educated him against his will as a
          merchant, and to his commercial education and pursuits are to be ascribed his freedom from
          classical reminiscences, his exclusively modern literary culture, his understanding of the
          foreign climes and countries with which commerce brings us into communication, and his
          distinctly modern turn of thought.</p>

        <p><pb n="359"/> Freiligrath is not, like Hoffmann von Fallersleben, his predecessor in the
          field of political poetry, only a prolific song writer; he is a genuine, inspired poet.
          Hoffmann, who had made a study of the old German songs and ballads, and was himself a man
          of simple, popular tastes, poured forth an inexhaustible stream of polemical verse,
          directed against the squirearchy and bureaucracy, but he repeated himself with the
          monotony of the popular poet. Freiligrath wrote comparatively little, but every one of his
          poems has its distinct individuality. He is influenced by that modern French and English
          poetry of which he has given us so many admirable translations, and makes his debut as a
          descriptive poet of the Victor Hugo school, but soon develops a distinct literary
          individuality. He possesses in a very high degree two qualities which are seldom found
          united, the faculty of picturesque description and intensity of feeling. The former leads
          him to depict themes from foreign lands, full of glowing colour, the latter displays
          itself when he sings of home and fatherland. In his revolutionary period his warm feeling
          became powerful pathos, and his gift of graphic delineation was exclusively devoted to the
          service of hostility and ire.</p>

        <p>In his youth, in Amsterdam (1831), the sea and the shipping made a deep impression on
          him. In his dreams he followed all the vessels that glided out of the harbour bound for
          Africa, for India, for Turkey, for America. He was seized by the desire to describe these
          foreign climes as they appeared in his imagination, and Hugo's _Les Orientales_ not only
          suggested the colours to be employed in the treatment of such themes, but also the
          metrical form. Freiligrath alone among German poets tried to master the alexandrines
          beloved of Frenchmen, despised in Germany, and to vindicate their beauty. Strangely
          enough, in spite of his usually correct ear, he so entirely misapprehended the peculiarity
          of this metre that he always writes it in pure iambics, a practice which Germans have
          continued.</p>

        <p>He was possessed by the longing to roam--out into the wide world, across the great ocean.
          Instead of German "garret poetry," he wrote, in his garret, scenes laid in the <pb n="360"
          /> deserts of Africa and the primeval forests of America. He attempted tropical local
          colouring, which was at times successful, at times unnatural; his linguistic specialty was
          new and remarkable rhymes, produced with the assistance of resonant foreign words like
          "Sykomore," "Tricolore," &amp;c. His good verses were like living, his bad, in their
          lifeless splendour, like stuffed humming-birds.</p>

        <p>But this African Freiligrath is not the best Freiligrath. Freiligrath, the Liberal
          patriot, is greatly his superior. After Herwegh's political challenge had roused him, he
          took himself to task, tested with simple-minded fairness those sympathies and tendencies
          of his nature as to which he himself was not yet absolutely clear, and discovered in the
          depths of his being an unquenchable desire for liberty and a sympathy with the oppressed
          which on occasion could develop into burning indignation and hatred. His genius chose the
          revolutionary path, pursued it at full speed, and finally spread its wings and flew.
          _Marseillaise_ after _Marseillaise_ came from the poet's pen. O these hymns of 1848! they
          are enthusiasm itself, the enthusiasm that begets enthusiasm. In the earlier ones we have
          fierceness, faith, revolutionary piety, fiery sarcasm, the intoxicated jubilation of
          victory; in the later, noble despair, sublime in its expression.</p>

        <p>But the poems which anticipate the Revolution and incite to it are also worth reading.
          Take, for instance, the volume entitled _Ça ira_, published in 1846. In each of the poems
          of which it consists a symbolical picture is graphically elaborated. In the first, a ship
          is setting sail; her name is Revolution, she is the black fire-ship that sends her rockets
          aboard that hypocritical craft, the Church, and then points her guns at the silver fleet
          of Wealth. In another we have a symbolical idea borrowed from Thomas Moore: the ice-palace
          of despotism, which will crack, and break up, and melt away as soon as spring comes. In
          _Wie man's macht_ ("How the Thing is Done") the poet describes the storming of the arsenal
          of a capital with such infectious ardour, so dramatically and vividly, that we see it all,
          are ourselves in the thick of the fray. As the Revolution which <pb n="361"/> he foresees
          draws nearer and nearer, his poetry becomes more and more up to date. He describes a Rhine
          steamer, which has the King and Queen of Prussia on board. The steamer is a picture of
          German society. The company on deck are enjoying the fresh air, the bright sunshine, the
          beautiful scenery of the Rhine; but down below in the engine-room stand the proletariat,
          in the shape of engineer and stoker, masters of the volcano that drives the ship onwards.
          One push, one blow from them, and the whole edifice of which the king is the crown,
          collapses; the deck is blown to fragments, the flames mount to the clouds--but not yet,
          thou angry element, not to-day! In such a poem as _Freie Presse_ the course of events is
          anticipated: the insurrection is on the point of breaking out; one day more, and there
          will be fighting in the streets. Ammunition being short, the owner of the printing works
          orders his workmen to melt down all the alphabets. And presently the hissing, glowing mass
          is flowing into the bullet moulds. The times are such that only in the form of bullets can
          the types emancipate humanity.</p>

        <p>The days of Young Germany were over, but now it seemed as if Germany herself had grown
          young.</p>

        <p>Robert Prutz (born in 1816 at Stettin) received that classical education which had been
          denied to Freiligrath. A critical student of philosophy and history, he wrote upon many
          subjects, but it is only as a political poet that he has any abiding significance. He was
          one of the young men who ardently vented their opinions in Ruge's _Hallische Jahrbücher_,
          the result in his case being banishment. He is the Feuerbachian as poet. His political
          poetry, from the absolute directness with which it follows its aim, is apt to be somewhat
          dry and unimaginative, but his sober and yet warm love of liberty attracts us. If you once
          learn to like him, it will be a thorough liking; you will even highly prize his latest
          collection of poems, _Aus der Heimath_, a book which has been foolishly condemned as
          sensual; it cannot be denied that he showed bad taste in dedicating it to his wife.</p>

        <p>In his best work, a little Aristophanic masterpiece entitled _Die politische Wochenstube_
          ("The Political Lying-in <pb n="362"/> Room"), Zürich, 1843, Prutz, Holberg's warmest
          German admirer,[1] has succeeded in epitomising the wit, the irony, the endeavour, and the
          hopes of the younger generation.</p>

        <p>It was only natural that a poet with Prutz's classical training should adopt the
          Aristophanic method, the pity was that he followed it too closely. His play became in
          consequence a jewel of price for a select circle of readers instead of food for the
          multitude. It is the production of a young, hopeful dreamer, whose faith in a glorious
          future for Germany was quite as lively and as strong as the pleasure he felt in
          demolishing with his sarcasm what was decrepit and decayed; the burlesque figures and
          conceits stand out against an idealistic golden background because the poet sees the sun
          of the future rising and shining behind them.</p>

        <p>The action passes partly in, partly outside of the house of a doctor who keeps a kind of
          private lying-in hospital, where young ladies of the upper classes at times take refuge.
          Of late his business has not thriven. It had flourished when Pietism flourished in
          Königsberg; much pious embracing had gone on then, which, with God's blessing, had borne
          fruit; but now that the State Church has set itself to suppress Pietism, his wards stand
          empty. He will soon be driven to apply for a post on the staff of the Prussian official
          newspaper; those who are fit for nothing else can always earn their bread in its service.
          The Doctor's servant, Kilian, who is famishing, asks for food. The Doctor advises him to
          have his stomach removed, takes out his knife to do the operation, tells him that he will
          never feel hungry again, and that he will confer an inestimable benefit on humanity if he
          can show himself as a living proof that the operation is possible. For what is the rock on
          which virtue splits nowadays? Why did Freiligrath take a pension? Why did Dingelstedt
          allow himself to be branded. The stomach, and nothing but the stomach is to blame for
          everything.</p>

        <p>In the meantime Herr Schlaukopf (Mr. Sly) has come <pb n="363"/> on the scene, disguised
          as a beggar. He declaims some patriotic sentiment, in the style of the Niebelungenlied, on
          the subject of Hermann the Cheruscan, and then asks for a contribution for the statue of
          that national hero. The Doctor is incautious enough to call the statue a scarecrow, a
          hideous sentry brandishing a spit, on which Schlaukopf declares that he shall pay for
          these words by at least twelve years' imprisonment with hard labour. They fight, the
          Doctor pulls off Schlaukopfs false nose, and thereupon recognises in him the friend of his
          youth, the quondam socialist, singer of liberty, republican, and regicide, now advanced to
          the post of "Wirklicher-geheimer-königlicher Leibspion" (Real Private Royal Body-spy).
          They fall into each other's arms, and Schlaukopf tells his errand, but not till he has
          assured himself that the Doctor holds no awkward or seditious political beliefs. The
          Doctor, recognising the importance of the man with whom he has to do, falls on his knees
          and swears that he believes nothing except that crown-pieces are round. Then Schlaukopf
          divulges the secret: "Germany, our mother-country, the Germany of Frederick and of Luther,
          the fair-haired queen, is with child."</p>

        <p>The Doctor is at first incredulous. Is it not dropsy, the result of all the
          water-drinking introduced by these new total abstinence associations? No, she is pregnant,
          and the only surprising thing about it is that the fact has not been announced in the
          newspapers, which usually inform the public when queens and princesses are in that
          condition. And now Schlaukopf communicates the joyful intelligence that the Doctor, as an
          experienced accoucheur, has been chosen to attend Germania; he, and no other, is to
          deliver her. The Doctor dances for joy, demands that he shall be rewarded with perquisites
          and an order, requests Schlaukopf to bring the lady--but see, she comes!</p>

        <p>Slaves, who represent the enthralled people, bear her in in a golden chair. She is fair,
          with a fat, amiable face, a wide mouth, and eyes of watery blue. All salute and do homage
          to her as Germania. But from a confidential conversation between her and Schlaukopf we
          learn that she is <pb n="364"/> not the person she gives herself out to be. He asks her if
          she is really pregnant; she replies that he ought to know best, he and the others whom he
          has introduced to her. It seems that he has taken her from the street and trained her to
          play her part. She is the official Germania--and she has done everything that her artful
          masters have ordered her to do, has bowed, and knelt, and pattered prayers at command. And
          now, at command, she is pregnant. Schlaukopf abuses her, and threatens to beat her; she
          taunts him and threatens in return to run away and leave him to find another Germania
          where he best can.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile in the darkness of night a stranger has appeared in the street in front of the
          house, a woman with a harassed, hunted look, who declares that she knows not where to lay
          her outlawed head. "I," she says, "the legitimate queen, must, like a common vagrant, hide
          my royal head in the darkness of night, whilst she who has been exalted in my stead and
          impudently allows herself to be called by my name, sleeps voluptuously on silken pillows.
          Ye stones, be my pillow! For my people, like their queen, have to lie on stone."</p>

        <p>Through the night comes a cry, "Germania!" The woman in the house and the woman on the
          street answer at the same moment. Wrangling and confusion ensue, the gendarmes arrive, and
          an attempt is made to discover which of the two has taken a name that does not belong to
          her. "Not I!" cries the stranger to Schlaukopf. She maintains that he has stolen her name
          and decked his brazen-faced paramour with it, and concludes: "Shame on you both! I alone
          am the real, the true Germania!" Kilian finds it impossible to believe that any one so
          slender and emaciated can be Germania, but the serfs are thrilled to the heart by the
          sweet sound of her voice. The diplomatic Schlaukopf alone keeps his countenance:</p>

        <p> "Allein, so thut ein wenig nur die Augen auf, Zu sehen braucht Ihr diese da und jene
          nur, So ist's ja klärlicb, welche hier die Rechte sei: In Lumpen jene, diese jedoch im
          seidnen Rock; Die abgemagert, hungerbleich, ein Schattenbild, <pb n="365"/> Verbannt zu
          Bettlern, selber eine Bettlerin; Höchst stattlich diese, wohlgenährt, anmuthiglich, In
          hoher Herren ehrender Festgenossenschaft, Ja selbst gesegneten Leibes ist, wie Ihr
          seht."[2]</p>

        <p>To this comparison between her rival's magnificence and her own poverty the stranger
          answers with dignity:</p>

        <p> "Wohl spotte mein! In meine Wunde lege du Die blutbefleckten, diebsgewandten Finger mir!
          Auf meine Lumpen speie du, und rühme dich Weil ich ein armes, heimathlos vertriebnes Weib;
          Du weisst am besten, wessen Hand mein Blut vergoss, Und wer vom Haupt die Krone mir
          gerissen hat. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Ihr bautest du Paläste, mir
          Gefängnisse. Ihr schmeichelten deine Schergen, mich verfolgten sie-- Dir aber sag ich,
          Schattenkönigin, o du, Die du mit Zittern meines Namens dich erfrechst: Hinweg! verbirg
          dich! Räume du den Platz, der mir Allein gebührt! Denn eure Herrscherin bin ich."[3]</p>

        <p>And the serfs bend low in homage to the woman who comes, not in regal purple, but in rags
          like their own, saying to each other: "May not this be the long-looked-for redresser of
          our wrongs, she who is to break our yoke asunder and awaken the sleeping world with the
          lightning flash of liberty?"</p>

        <p>But now the two women are called upon to prove their respective claims. Schlaukopf
          exclaims: "It is the legitimist principle we are called on to defend!" and proceeds to
          prompt official Germania. That fat, fair lady, who boasts that she bears the future of
          Germany in her womb and <pb n="366"/> claims in consequence to be treated with
          consideration and reverence, repeats a long rigmarole, supposed to be the story of her
          life: In the gray of eld she lay on bear-skins in the forest, drinking foaming mead and
          eating beech-nuts and acorns. "Beech-nuts and acorns!" cry the Doctor, Kilian, and
          Schlaukopf. "It is she." Then she tells how she was sent to school to the priests, had her
          nose flattened against the crucifix, became _christlich-germanisch_, endowed monasteries,
          built churches, kissed the Pope's toe, &amp;c, &amp;c., and once more the Doctor, Kilian,
          and Schlaukopf cry: "It is she!" She tells what a peaceable, governable disposition she
          developed, how she allowed any one that liked to box her ears, how her loyalty has now
          reached such a pitch that if her master but whistle, she comes, stands on her hind legs,
          fetches the stick--"In a word, I am a well-trained poodle." And again we hear the jubilant
          chorus: "It is she!" She concludes: "God and the king willing, I shall be in the future
          what I have been in the past. By government order I am now, as you see, with child. O
          gendarmes, take my part! Recognise me as the one, true, Germania, as the thoroughbred
          German, and be assured that in return I will bring up my son as a gendarme!"</p>

        <p>The gendarmes are of opinion that she has made out a good case, and Schlaukopf is
          beginning to boast that the vagrant has been silenced, when she in turn lifts up her
          voice. She does not understand the art of self-praise, she says, nor has she much to
          praise herself for; the future will show what she is. "I cannot deny," she continues,
          "that she who stands there is a Germania; she is official Germany, the Germany of the
          Government, of the Federal Diet; but the Germany of the German people she is not; they do
          not know her, they do not care a straw for her rotten genealogical tree. If you would know
          which is the true Germania, ask these fettered serfs!" At this moment the other Germania
          is seized with violent pains. She suddenly explodes with a loud report and disappears in a
          cloud of smoke, which, as it gradually disperses, takes the shape of pilgrim monks, of
          romantic poets who sing <pb n="367"/> the praises of the holy Middle Ages, of geese who
          lament that the Order of the Swan is not yet instituted, of moderate Liberals singing the
          chorus:</p>

        <p> "Immer langsam voran, immer langsam voran! Dass der preussische Fortschritt nachkommen
          kann!"[4]</p>

        <p>Then the serfs break their chains, cast themselves on the ground before the poor
          stranger, and do homage to her as the true Germania, who is still a virgin, but who one
          day will give birth to the ruler of the future....</p>

        <p>The emblematical picture is a very fine, powerful one, and moreover it is true. The
          German Empire of to-day is not the offspring of the oppressed, divided Germany that was
          then extolled as pregnant with future greatness; it is the outcome of the much-despised,
          the harshly suppressed endeavours after liberty and unity. It is a mistake, however, to
          have represented the true Germania with no past, with all her power and glory in the
          future; though such a break of historical continuity did not in those days seem the
          impossibility that it does in ours.</p>

        <p>One of the truths proclaimed by this Radical polemical poem admits of no controversion,
          namely, that the official fatherland, the official country, everywhere lays claim to all
          that the genius of the people in times past has produced, to all their great men, even
          those whose lives were one constant rebellion against it. It banished, imprisoned,
          executed them--no matter; now it wears their portraits next its heart. And the official
          fatherland claims, and always has claimed, to bear the future in its womb. It not only
          maintains that the present existence of all and of everything is inseparably bound up with
          its existence, but that it is pregnant with the new age and is consequently entitled to
          receive the respectful care that is the due of a pregnant queen. For the thinking men of
          any people there is, besides this fatherland, another, one that is not recognised, that is
          often disowned. It does not deck itself with the national colours; for it the national
          song is not sung. <pb n="368"/> It exists wherever people feel and act in the spirit that
          has been the spirit of the best of the country's sons. It has the allegiance of all the
          thinking youth. Those of low degree have more part and lot in it than those in place and
          power. To it alone the future belongs.</p>

        <p>[1] The name of one of Holberg's best known comedies is _The Lying-in Room_
          ("Barselstuen").</p>

        <p>[2] To know which is the true Germania, you need but use your eyes. Look first at one and
          then the other. Is not the one in rags, the other clad in silk? the one starving and pale,
          a mere shadow, driven to house with beggars, herself a beggar; the other stately, plump,
          and pleasant to the sight, consorting with right honourable gentlemen; with child
          moreover, as you plainly see?</p>

        <p>[3] Yes, mock at me! Put your pilfering, blood-stained fingers into my wounds! Spit on my
          rags, and proclaim me to be a poor, banished, homeless woman. You know best whose hand

        <head>REVOLUTIONARY POETRY</head>

        <p>There were real poets, aspiring spirits, who did not follow the general trend of
          literature at this period. There were men like Eduard Mörike (born in 1804), the last
          scion of the Swabian School, who broke the bounds of its narrow tradition, and in his
          lyric verse may rather be regarded as an offshoot of the Goethe stem--a genuinely gifted
          poet, the idyllic, arch, melancholy singer of the inner life, author of the immortal poem,
          _Denk es, O Seele!_ And there were men like Otto Ludwig, the Thuringian, and Friedrich
          Hebbel, the Ditmarschian, the two most robust originals in modern German literature, who
          were both born in 1813, and both developed their very dissimilar peculiarities after
          1848--two gnarled, leafy oaks standing without the forest's bounds. The only mark of the
          period in which they were youths is the peculiar defiant gloom which lies deep down in
          both natures. Specially their own is a kind of melancholy keen-sightedness, inclining
          towards bold realism. They are the heralds of the realism of a later, unpolitical age. But
          they have not the characteristic common to all the political poets of their own age--sunny
          enthusiasm, a natural bias towards public life, towards the radical reform, or, if
          necessary, the complete revolution of society.</p>

        <p>This bias, in combination with the philosophic lucidity due to the influence of Hegel and
          Feuerbach, is perhaps most remarkably observable in an author whose writings are,
          undeservedly, beginning to be somewhat neglected nowadays, an author who, dying at the
          early age of thirty-one, did not live to see the Revolution of March. This is Friedrich
          von Sallet, a young German officer of extraordinary strength of character, whose solid,
          comprehensive culture was due to his own unaided efforts. In him the profound <pb n="370"
          /> thought of his age is united with its extreme, passionate Liberalism. After his
          dismissal from the army in 1831, he devoted himself entirely to literature.</p>

        <p>His best known work is his _Laien-Evangelium_, a kind of devotional book for
          free-thinkers, a series of poems in which he gives a symbolical modern interpretation to
          the various events of the Gospels. He begins each poem with some story or lesson from the
          Bible, and then proceeds to show the living, eternal kernel in it, and to cast away the
          historical or mythical husks. The interpretations are at times rather far-fetched, and the
          employment of but one metre throughout the whole book undeniably tends to monotony. In its
          general conception the work reminds us of another, older book, Leopold Schefer's
          _Laien-Brevier_; but the contrast is great between Schefer's comfortable satisfaction with
          the divine government of the universe, and Sallet's impatient inclination to interfere
          with the natural course of events. We are also slightly reminded of Rückert's _Weisheit
          der Bramanen_; but Sallet's wisdom is a wrathful wisdom, no peaceful collection of golden
          rules of life like Rückert's, but fiery denunciation of deceit and stupidity. In his
          introductory poem Sallet compares those who had written Oriental poetry before him to the
          Kings of the East, who offered gold, frankincense, and myrrh to the Light of the world,
          and then fell back again into their Oriental dream-life. Now, he says, light is once more
          dawning, thought is once more rousing from their slumber both East and West. In his eager
          advocacy of his ideals, he is too indifferent to colouring, too Western; his book is
          spoiled by its too modern, directly didactic tone.</p>

        <p>The collection of poems known as _Gedichte_ is a much finer one. Here again the political
          poems are the most important.</p>

        <p>He describes a sleeping giant, on whose head and breast foolish dwarfs are disporting
          themselves. They sit on chairs in his open mouth and pay compliments to each other; spread
          their tables and dine upon his stomach; declare that it is his duty to sleep--if he does
          not, they will punish him with pin-pricks. They believe that God has created the <pb
            n="371"/> great giant solely that they may disport themselves merrily on the top of him,
          the truth being that if he were to awake and rise there would be an end of them. The poet
          himself is tickling the giant's nose with his paper in hopes that he will perhaps sneeze;
          that alone would play the deuce with them. He cries: "Awake and see how they are daring to
          behave; it will be an easy matter for you to drive them away." And he concludes: "I know
          perfectly well what the giant's name is, but I have my reasons for not divulging it."</p>

        <p>In another poem, _Ecce Homo_, instead of appealing to the people as a people, he appeals
          to man as man: "There stands the old, grey cathedral, and there the old, fortified royal
          castle, looking down on wandering humanity passing beneath them, one generation after
          another. Song is heard from the one, fealty is sworn in the other, from century to
          century; we seem, in comparison with them, but insects of a day. And therefore fools
          preach veneration for these houses of cards. For what are they but card-castles, built for
          himself by man in his childhood! He built them, and he can knock them down, and build
          others in their stead. Heaven and earth are but soft clay, which man can mould as he
          inclines."</p>

        <p>At times Sallet writes in a lighter, more playful tone: "What is the name of the old man
          to whom people everywhere, but these good Germans in particular, are devoted, though he
          has never done anything worth doing? He stands in the pulpit, he drills the soldiers, he
          administers justice, he lectures at the universities, and his voice carries weight in the
          councils of the State. Taking a hundred steps to do what could be done with one jump is
          called in his language 'the good old ways and customs'; this is what he approves of, but
          if you produce anything original and great, his wrath is aroused and he scolds and storms
          till men begin to be afraid of you. He is wanting both in brains and backbone, the old
          gentleman, and yet he rules almost absolutely, and to oppose him successfully one would
          need to be as strong as a lion. There is no reason for concealing his name; it is Old
          Routine."</p>

        <p><pb n="372"/> Among the _Gedichte_ are also clever parodies, such as the one in which the
          poet attacks the censor, by whom he was perpetually worried:</p>

        <p> "Kennst Du das Land, wo Knut und Kantschu blühn, Den Steiss von Zarenliebe machend
          glühn, Wo man das Zeitungsblatt schwarz überstreicht, Dass preussisch' Landtagsgift in's
          Volk nicht schleicht, Kennst du es wohl? Dahin, dahin, Möcht' ich mit dir, geliebter
          Censor, fliehn."</p>

        <p>He is even more wroth with the cowardly prophet than with the censor: "Ever so slight a
          blow with your hand," he says, "and the mummy falls to pieces, once it has been brought up
          from the airless subterranean halls to the light of day; it will stand intact so long as
          no hand is raised against it." He is furious with those who declare that things will
          happen of themselves, that historical evolution, &amp;c, will bring them about. Nothing
          irritates him so much as to hear people say: "A change _must_ come; things _cannot_ go on
          as they are doing." "Since the beginning of the world," he says, "nothing has ever
          happened of itself."</p>

        <p>He could not, on account of the censorship, attack monarchy directly, but he gives us, in
          excellent verse, the parable of the bear. Much in the same manner as wolves are kept in
          the Capitol in Rome, the bear is kept in Berne as the emblem of the city. On this practice
          Sallet founds his fable: "The people of the Canton of Berne in days of old kept a bear.
          They let him live on the fat of the land, but they took good care to keep his claws cut in
          case he should take it into his head to tear them to pieces. When asked to explain what
          good the bear did them, they answered with surprise: 'Explain! Why, what should he do! He
          eats his fill, he moves about majestically, he growls--he is our bear, and that is
          enough.' If questioned as to why they kept him, they gave answer: 'Because our fathers
          did. If the race were to die out, all would be over with us.' If any one ventured once
          again to ask why, they only shouted; 'Hold your tongue, or we'll beat out your
          brains.'</p>

        <p>"One day loud cries were heard throughout the town; the citizens thronged together--the
          bear lay dead. He had <pb n="373"/> died suddenly; they had no new bear ready to take his
          place, and everywhere the dolorous cry resounded: 'It is all over with the Canton of
          Berne! Up and away, brave hunters! Get us a new bear!</p>

        <p>"In vain the hunters explore the mountains and the ravines; they cannot find a bear. But
          in spite of this, wonderful to relate, corn and grapes ripen, fruit grows on the trees--it
          seems as if nature were utterly indifferent to the woe of Berne. The sun, though it saw
          the bear lie dead, still rises every morning--the world still stands. What can be the
          meaning of it?"</p>

        <p>Witty as the fable is, it will hardly convince any supporter of monarchy of the
          uselessness of that institution. Sallet only attacks the foolish worship of the supposedly
          indispensable symbol, without making any attempt to dispute the most frequently employed
          argument in favour of monarchy, namely, the benefit which results from the withdrawal of
          the highest of all positions from competition. He puts his whole soul into another poem,
          _Aut--Aut_, a poem which became a sort of watchword for the youth of the day. Its most
          characteristic verses are:</p>

        <p> "Die ihr den grossen Kampf der Zeit Ausfechten wollt, herbei ihr Ritter! Sprecht,
          welcher Sach' ihr euch geweiht, Sprecht frei durchs offne Helmgegitter!
          Entweder--oder!</p>

        <p> Für Fürstenmacht, für Volkesrecht? Für Geisteslicht, für Pfaffendunkel? Republikaner
          oder Knecht? Ja oder nein! nur kein Gemunkel! Entweder--oder!"[1]</p>

        <p>And the poem concludes with an allusion to the time now fast approaching when the last on
          one side or the other with cloven skull will bite the dust.</p>

        <p>Sallet did not live to take part in the great, decisive <pb n="374"/> encounter for which
          he so ardently longed. He died in 1843. Not long after his death the storm-clouds begin to
          thicken and the birds to fly low. We are approaching 1848.</p>

        <p>Literature follows in Sallet's path. From all parts of Germany comes the cry: "Let deeds
          follow upon words!" We hear it not only from the poets of North Germany, the Rhineland,
          and Switzerland; three poets of far-off Austria, Karl Beck, Alfred Meissner, Moritz
          Hartmann join in the chorus.</p>

        <p>Karl Beck, the son of a Hungarian and a Hungarian Jewess, born at Baja in 1817, first
          studied medicine in Vienna, but gave that up, devoted himself to literature under the
          auspices of Gustav Kühne, and produced a succession of poetical works which attracted
          attention by their faithful and vivid delineation of Hungarian scenery and Hungarian
          national character. As regards this aspect of his work, Beck may be classed with the
          Hungarian national poet, Petöfi, a man five years his junior; but as the poet of liberty,
          he must be regarded as a disciple of Börne--the only one who was of any importance as a
          poet. Like Börne he is the champion of the Jewish race, of the proletariat, and of
          political liberty. In his writing we have the Old Testament style and pathos combined with
          the influence of the newest French and German oppositionist literature. In Austrian poetry
          Anastasius Grün and Lenau are his immediate predecessors. He had not the culture of a
          Prutz, but his writing is distinguished by fervid colouring, emotional glow, graphic
          power, and wrathful enthusiasm. He was, however, one of those who, hailing the outbreak of
          the Revolution with joy, changed the key-note of their song after the victory of the
          reaction. After the magnificent revolt of Hungary had been crushed, he addressed a poem to
          the Emperor of Austria in which he flatters the victor, and entreats him to have mercy on
          the captive heroes. This poem enraged his old companions in arms. They called to mind that
          he who was now playing the part of a loyal subject of the Emperor of Austria had, before
          the collapse, been a republican and a socialist.[2]</p>

        <p><pb n="375"/> Alfred Meissner (born at Teplitz in 1822) and Moritz Hartmann (born at
          Duschnitz in 1821), Bohemia's two best lyric poets, are both inspired by the most ardent
          desire for political liberty.</p>

        <p>It is unfair to allow the unpleasant ending to Meissner's literary career to blind us to
          his unquestionably genuine poetical talent. It is both pitiable and monstrous that one of
          Germany's best lyric poets should, after an honourable youth, have descended so low as to
          buy the manuscripts of an inferior novel-writer and publish them under his own name, but
          it does not detract from his worth as author of the fine poems which undoubtedly are his
          own. As specimens of a revolutionary eloquence which was, and with reason, irresistible to
          the youth of the Forties, read his glowing lines to the memory of Byron and George
          Sand.</p>

        <p>Moritz Hartmann, Meissner's countryman and contemporary, is a figure cast in different
          metal; there is no flaw in him; he is a hero as well as an unusually gifted poet. No other
          German poet has loved liberty so faithfully and passionately from his earliest youth to
          the day of his death, or risked his life for it so daringly and so often.</p>

        <p>Hartmann, who was one of the handsomest men it is possible to imagine, was born of Jewish
          parents in the little town of Duschnitz. The family was of Spanish origin, the name
          Hartmann being a translation of Duros. Moritz was sent to school in Prague, where, as a
          boy, he witnessed the banished King Charles the Tenth's melancholy entrance into the town.
          At the early age of thirteen he emancipated himself from the religious faith of his
          family, and while still a mere child was deeply affected by the news of the discomfiture
          of the Polish revolutionists. As a student he became acquainted with Lenau, to whom he
          devoted himself with the enthusiasm of a boy and a disciple. From his childhood he spoke
          both Czech and German, and his first book of poems, _Kelch und Schwert_ ("Chalice and
          Sword"), contains abundant indication of his love for the Czech language, which he ranks
          with Polish, and extols as superior to Russian. But when it comes to the question of Czech
            <pb n="376"/> political sympathy with Russia and hatred of everything German, he is
          entirely the German.</p>

        <p>In _Kelch und Schwert_ (1845) the Bohemian predominates. The little introductory poem
          tells us as much:</p>

        <p> "Der ich komm' aus dem Hussitenlande, Glaube, dass ich Gottes Blut genossen, Liebe fühl'
          ich in mein Herz gegossen, Lieb' ist Gottes Blut--mein Herz sein _Kelch_.</p>

        <p> Der ich komm' aus dem Hussitenlande, Glaube an die fleischgewordnen Worte, Dass Gedanken
          werden zur Kohorte Und jedwedes Lied ein heilig _Schwert?_[3]</p>

        <p>A native of that country from which the emancipating doctrines of Huss have been
          banished, he feels himself a Hussite, and interprets the old Hussite war-cry, the right of
          the laity to receive the chalice in the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, in a modern
          spirit, almost the spirit of Feuerbach. In a poem on the German "songs of liberty" he
          tells the lyric poets of Germany that song is not the hammer that will shatter a prince's
          heart; also that liberty is a woman, and not to be won by words alone. He feels for the
          Poles as if he were himself a Pole. We are made aware that he loves a Polish lady, and
          that through his love to her he has become in his heart her countryman. The poem, _To
          C----a_, is one of the most beautiful that sympathy with Poland has produced. Hartmann can
          at times be prolix and commonplace, but much more frequently he is concise and dramatic.
          Some of his scenes impress themselves indelibly on the reader's mind. Read, for instance,
          _Die Drei_, the poem of the three exiles who meet in a lonely inn on the plains of
          Hungary. They are sitting silent over their wine in the stillness of night, when some one
          suddenly raises his glass and cries: "Our country!" Of the three, one is a gipsy, one a
          Jew, and one <pb n="377"/> a Pole. They have no country; they look at their glasses and
          sit silent as before.</p>

        <p>Even more impassioned than his pity for Poland is his pity for Bohemia, "the poor stag
          that is bleeding to death in the depths of a forest." Nothing is left to the Bohemians but
          their music, that sweet music which awakes compassion for them everywhere, which sings and
          sobs and melts men's hearts with its mysterious melodies.</p>

        <p>We may say of this first book of poems what the poet himself has said of the following:
          "Not a song in it but has been kissed on the brow by liberty, the most beautiful and noble
          of all muses." He already gives frank expression to his hatred of Metternich's Austria,
          that Austria which in 1848, in his _Reimchronik des Pfaffen Mauritius_, he was to call the
          Bastille of the nations, within whose walls the silence of death is only broken by the
          clank of fetters.</p>

        <p>The sensation created by _Kelch und Schwert_ meant exile for Hartmann. He had, in the
          first instance, transgressed the laws of Austria by publishing in a foreign town a work
          which had not been submitted to Austrian censorship. He knew that if he were to return
          from Leipzig, where he had been living for some time, in intercourse with Kühne and Laube,
          he was liable to be arrested on the frontier. But he could not resist the desire to see
          his mother again, and succeeded in making his way secretly to his native town. It was not
          possible to conceal his presence there; a traitor betrayed him, and he was obliged, before
          many days had passed, to make his escape by a back-door while the police were forcing
          their way into the house. In his _Zeitlosen_ there is a set of poems entitled _Heimkehr
          und Flucht_, in which he describes this youthful escapade, and thus proudly delineates his
          own character:</p>

        <p> "Und als der Verrath mich ausgewittert Und als die Häscher herangekommen, Da hat die
          bleiche Mutter gezittert, Der Schwester Aug' in Thänen geschwommen. Ich aber sprach: Die
          Thränen verwischet, Wir müssen scheiden und von einander, Und da mich rings die Gefahr
          umzischet, In Flammen werd' ich zum Salamander.</p>

        <p><pb n="378"/> Ich bin geboren, ich, für Gefahren, Sie lauern immer auf meinem Gange Wie
          Wegelagrer in dunklen Schaaren; Doch kenn' ich nimmer die Furcht, die bange. Ich bin zu
          Gefahren bestimmt und geboren, Sie lieben mich, wie Löwen den Meister. Ich hab' sie alle
          heraufbeschworen, Sie dienen mir, wie dem Zaubrer die Geister."[4]</p>

        <p>On account of the prologue which he spoke at the Schiller Festival at Leipzig on the 11th
          of November 1847, a festival which was in reality a demonstration in favour of the liberty
          of the press, Hartmann was accused of high treason and of offering affront to the Emperor
          of Austria. In 1848, as soon as the revolution broke out, he hastened to Prague. He and
          two friends, of whom Alfred Meissner was one, were sent as a deputation to Vienna. He has
          given an exquisitely humorous account of their audience with Archduke Franz Karl, who
          received them because his brother, the Emperor, was ill, and who was perfectly unable to
          understand what they wanted.[5] When the rabble, during the disturbances in Prague,
          attempted to storm the Jewish quarter and slaughter its inhabitants, it was Hartmann who
          rushed to the university, persuaded a body of armed students to accompany him, and with
          their assistance defended the quarter against the maddened crowd until the grenadiers
          arrived.[6]</p>

        <p>In the Parliament of Frankfort Hartmann voted with the extreme Left; his aim was the
          unity of Germany as a republic. He spoke seldom, but attracted much attention; he was
          known as the handsomest man in the Parliament. Kinkel describes him at this time as a
          handsome, <pb n="379"/> amiable man, with firm convictions; "the Southern imagination of
          the Austrian gave him fluency of speech, his German training had given him solidity; with
          Jewish cosmopolitanism he combined a steadfast patriotism which not unfrequently found
          utterance in proud words." At first he took part enthusiastically in the proceedings of
          the Parliament. Afterwards, when these became both tedious and barren, and the assembly
          showed its incapability of laying any great and lasting new foundation, his disappointment
          found vent in the witty, impressive _Reimchronik_, a work written in the metre of Hans
          Sachs. Hartmann, however, was not only a man of words, but a man of deeds. In the
          engagement in the streets of Frankfort on the 18th of September, he exposed himself a
          hundred times to the bullets of both parties in his endeavours to arrange a truce. After
          the revolution had broken out in Vienna, he and Froebel went there as deputies from
          Frankfort to the provisional government to express the sympathies of the national
          assembly, and Hartmann entered the army of the revolution as a common soldier. When Vienna
          was defending itself desperately against the Croats, he one day, with apparently certain
          death before him, joined a party that were determined to march through a severe fire to
          gain possession of a mill, and was made officer and leader when the original leader fell.
          After the fall of Vienna he escaped, thanks to the protection of a lady of high position,
          who procured him a falsified passport. He returned to his duties in the Parliament of
          Frankfort, and, when it broke up, went with the protesting party to Stuttgart. There this
          last remnant of the Parliament was dispersed by force of arms.</p>

        <p>All Hartmann's work, including the youthful poetry written before 1848, bears the mark of
          his resolute character. In the volume, _Neuere Gedichte_, published in 1847, which as a
          whole is unpolitical, we find in the division _Ost und West_ wild omens of the coming
          European storm--for example, the irate poem to the King of Prussia, in which Hartmann,
          deprecating Platen's and Herwegh's respectful attitude, cries shame upon him for
          delivering up <pb n="380"/> the Poles to the Russian knout, and that other very touching
          poem, _Hüter, ist die Nacht bald hin?_ ("Watchman, is the Night nigh past?"), which is one
          long sigh of impatient desire for the dawning of the new era.</p>

        <p>And now that Bohemia and Hungary, Franconia and North Germany, were lifting up their
          voices in one great chorus--the voices of thinkers and of poets blending in unison--the
          youth of the country, as soon as they awakened to intellectual life, were impelled to join
          that chorus; from the boy on the school-bench to the oldest student, their minds were
          re-attuned, attuned to the key of revolution. Now they suddenly began not only to imbibe a
          revolutionary spirit from the works of the revolutionary writers of the day, but to read
          one into the writings of approved neutral and conservative authors long since dead. At a
          given moment it became their persuasion that all literature called to arms, even that old
          classic literature which was living its immortal life in handsome bindings on the
          bookshelves. A certain frame of mind is the result of our reading of all books.</p>

        <p>What had he been, that Schiller whose writings had been put into their hands when they
          were children? What but a revolutionary, the motto of whose first book was the famous
          saying that what medicines cannot cure, cold steel cures, and what cold steel cannot cure,
          fire cures. Did the spirit of his works in any single point harmonise with the royal
          Prussian or the Austrian imperial spirit? What had Goethe's youthful attitude been but one
          of Titanic defiance? Did not even the work of his old age, the second part of _Faust_, end
          with the wish that he could see a free people on free soil? He had loathed the Berlin of
          Frederick II., would not his detestation of the Berlin of Frederick William IV. be greater
          still? From the writings of Hegel, who had begun life as a revolutionary and ended it as
          an ultra-conservative, they drew all the conclusions which he himself had left undrawn.
          Feuerbach had declared that he would have nothing to do with politics, nevertheless they
          transposed his philosophic decapitation of the historical state into the region of
          practical politics.</p>

        <p><pb n="381"/> Yes, the clouds were gathering. In place of the swallows, the heraldic
          eagles of Prussia and Austria were flying low. The monarchs attempted in vain to exorcise
          the tempest. Frederick William IV. convened a general Landtag (Parliament) in April 1847.
          With his convictions he could not do otherwise than open it with a speech in which, in
          spite of all concessions, real and apparent, he made it clear that he was not prepared to
          take the decisive step which his people demanded of him.</p>

        <p>"No power on earth," he cried, "will make me consent to the exchange of the natural
          relation between a king and his people for a conventional, constitutional relation; never
          with my will shall a written paper interfere between Almighty God and this country, rule
          us with its paragraphs, and supercede ancient, sacred loyalty."[7]</p>

        <p>The time had come. The assembly demanded annual Parliaments and complete fulfilment of
          the promises made in 1815 and 1829. Jacoby, Heinrich Simon, Gervinus, and others
          criticised the king's proposals and rejected them.</p>

        <p>Then the storm broke--first in Switzerland, where in November 1847 the Liberal cantons
          armed and suppressed the Jesuitical _Sonderbund_ (league of the Catholic cantons), then
          with overpowering force in Paris, then in all the German and many of the other European
          capitals. As thunder in a mountainous country echoes from hill to hill, so the thunder of
          the revolution echoed from one European country to another in the mad and holy year,
          1848.</p>

        <head>THE REVOLUTION</head>

        <p> "Im Hochland fiel der erste Schuss-- Im Hochland wider die Pfaffen! Da kam, die fallen
          wird und muss, Ja, die Lawine kam in Schuss-- Drei Länder in den Waffen! Schon kann die
          Schweiz von Siegen ruhn: Das Urgebirg und die Nagelfluhn Zittern vor Lust bis zum
          Kerne!</p>

        <p> Drauf ging der Tanz in Welschland los-- Die Scyllen und Charybden, Vesuv und Aetna
          brachen los: Ausbruch auf Ausbruch, Stoss auf Stoss! --'Sehr bedenklich, Euer Liebden!'
          Also schallt's von Berlin nach Wien Und von Wien zurück nach Berlin-- Sogar dem Nickel
          graut es! (Nickel, _i.e._ Czar Nicholas.)</p>

        <p> Und nun ist denn auch abermals Das Pflaster aufgerissen, Auf dem die Freiheit, nackten
          Stahls Aus der lumpigen Pracht des Königssaals Zwei Könige schon geschmissen."[1]</p>

        <p>Thus sang Freiligrath in February 1848, a few days after the revolution in Paris. A long
          shudder, of pain and at the same time of relief, passed through the whole of <pb n="383"/>
          Germany. It was as if a window had been opened, and air had reached the lungs of Europe.
          Example, the one power that can do miracles, was forcing the German people to action. They
          were also impelled by the fear that absolutism would now venture its last move, would
          declare Germany to be endangered by the revolution in France, and compel the people of
          Prussia and Austria to take up arms against the French republic.</p>

        <p>In Austria intolerance had gone as far as it could go. In 1846 Metternich's government
          had actually placed the _Herzensergüsse_ of the Emperor Joseph II., collected and
          published by a banished patriot, on the list of contraband books. And now the disturbances
          in the Austro-Italian provinces, which were endangering the credit of the state and the
          industries of the country, brought dissatisfaction with Metternichs rule to a climax. The
          decisive defeat he had met with in Switzerland, namely, the collapse of that Jesuitical
          "Sonderbund" which with all his might he had supported against the Radicals, had given the
          last blow to men's faith in his invincibility. In one of the provinces of Prussia,
          Silesia, bureaucratic misgovernment had just produced terrible consequences. Typhus, the
          result of starvation, had raged for months among the miserably poor industrial population
          before those in power had made any attempt to remedy the state of matters. Hundreds of
          dead and dying lay by the roadsides. In the cold of January, poor, solitary wretches
          starved in their hovels, and naked children pined to death beside the corpses of their
          parents; no one came to their aid, for the ignorant local authorities had, in order to
          prevent the spread of infection, made it a punishable offence to enter any infected house.
          All this time the government officials only appeared to collect the taxes, which they did
          with harsh regardlessness of circumstances; and when the Governor was attacked because no
          remedial measures had been taken from August 1847 to the end of January 1848, he answered
          that no formal appeal for assistance had been made.</p>

        <p>In such circumstances the political leaders of the middle classes found it an easy matter
          to rouse their own class to <pb n="384"/> action, and the working classes, hoping to
          improve their position, and exasperated by arbitrary police regulations, everywhere
          followed in the footsteps of the middle classes.</p>

        <p>It is difficult for the present generation to enter into the feelings of the men of 1848.
          The frame of mind which prevailed in Denmark at that time cannot be regarded as typical.
          There, as elsewhere, it undoubtedly was the instinct of national self-preservation and
          pride that asserted itself. But whereas the other countries rose in revolt against
          hereditary rule and coercion, in Denmark a revolt was suppressed by the power of the
          hereditary monarchy and of insulted national feeling. There was no thought of revolution
          in the minds of the Danes; it was for old rights they fought, not for new ideas.</p>

        <p>Everywhere else in Europe the oppressed peoples revolted. It was long since anything but
          evil had fallen to their lot, since they had witnessed the triumph of anything but wrong,
          use-and-wont, and falsehood. Actual and detestable had with them come to be almost
          synonymous terms. But they had a faith that could remove mountains and a hope that could
          shake the earth. Liberty, Parliament, national unity, liberty of the press, republic, were
          to them magic words, at the very sound of which their hearts leaped like the heart of a
          youth who suddenly sees his beloved.</p>

        <p>The aspiring spirits of the generation of to-day do not feel thus. They know that
          stupidity is a ferocious animal, and the hardest of all to kill--that cowardice, the agile
          slave that stands at the beck of power, is as strong as courage itself when there is any
          question of defending ancient privilege--that what is known by the name of progress is a
          feeble snail. The simpleton in the fable bought a raven that he might see for himself if
          it was true that ravens live for two hundred years. The friends of progress in our days
          know beforehand that all the raven-black lies and raven-trickeries of all the
          privilege-rookeries, great and small, will outlive them--for how many hundred years they
          cannot tell. At a rare time they have seen good victorious, but never have they heard it
          acknowledged that it is _their_ good which has triumphed. They have always seen truth
          first <pb n="385"/> abused, then if possible killed--if that proved impossible, maimed and
          recognised. Therefore they have little hope. Many of them, indeed, have killed hope in
          their own breasts, as we kill a nerve that gives us too much pain. They have been
          disappointed too often.</p>

        <p>The men of 1848 had never relinquished their hope in the future. They had been oppressed,
          and they had suffered so long that they had grown accustomed to see brute force and
          hypocrisy triumphant, accustomed to live in a sort of spiritual twilight. But they
          believed in the coming day. And now, suddenly, they saw it. First a gleam, then a ray,
          then a flame, then the whole horizon, as far as the eye could reach, a sea of light. For
          the first time they heard loud, ringing voices proclaim liberty to be the right of the
          people, without a voice raised in opposition; and for the first time, with wondering eyes,
          they saw power, that hitherto immovable mass, the giant bearer of oppression and
          falsehood, begin to stir like some gigantic elephant, writhe and turn and shake itself,
          throw off its riders, and move ponderously in the direction of the high-spirited, ardent
          friends of liberty, the men of the new day, who stood ready to fling themselves on its
          back and force it to trample down all the ancient abuses.</p>

        <p>For the younger men especially it was a moment without compare, a sight that intoxicated
          them, that drove them wild. They shouted, they sang, they rejoiced, and in their wild
          exultation they felt it a necessity to act, to risk all, to give their lives if need
          be--anything, everything, except be behindhand in greeting and ushering in the dawning day
          of liberty.</p>

        <p>True it is that democratic illusions held high revelry; true it is that there prevailed a
          touchingly naïve belief in the infallibility of popular instincts; and true it is that the
          ability of theorists to settle practical difficulties was greatly overestimated. But the
          first impulse was irresistible, the original instinct was correct. Those who really
          possessed capacity became leaders, took the command without any fuss or parade, and were
          obeyed, not because of their outward authority, but because their real superiority was
          felt by all.</p>

        <p><pb n="386"/> The score of students who commanded on the barricades in Berlin may be
          given as an instance. Many a so-called very ordinary man for a few days of his life showed
          himself to be a hero. During the first months some of the finest qualities of humanity
          displayed themselves and shone with astonishing lustre.</p>

        <p>It was in Austria that the revolutionary movement began, immediately after the arrival of
          the news of the Revolution of February in Paris. A speech made by Kossuth in the Hungarian
          Parliament on the 3rd of March, demanding constitutional government for all the provinces
          of the Empire, inaugurated the revolution both in Buda-Pesth and Vienna. On the 11th of
          March a similar demand was made by the Czechs in Prague, and before this, on the 6th of
          March, the Austrian Industrial Union had presented a petition to Archduke Franz Karl, the
          presumptive heir to the throne, requesting Metternich's dismissal, and also demanding
          liberty of the press, the right of voting supplies, of taking part in legislation,
          &amp;c.</p>

        <p>On this followed what has been called the petition storm. Every day, every hour new
          petitions to the Emperor poured in. On the 12th of March the students held a great meeting
          at the University, the result of which was also a petition to the Emperor, demanding
          liberty of the press, religious liberty, and liberty of instruction. The Emperor received
          the deputation the following day, but gave an undecided answer. In these unforeseen
          circumstances the 13th of March, the opening day of the Lower Austrian Convention of the
          Estates, arrived and found the Government unprepared. The populace crowded into the
          enclosure of the assembly hall, where Kossuth's speech was read aloud amidst excited
          rejoicings and shouts of "Hurrah for the constitution!" A party forced their way into the
          hall and began to smash the furniture and throw it out on to the heads of the soldiers;
          even Archduke Albrecht, who was in command, was struck by a block of wood. Then the order
          was given to fire, and the first Revolution of Vienna broke out. The Italian troops fired,
          but the Austrians unscrewed their bayonets amidst the joyful shouts of the <pb n="387"/>
          crowd. At the Castle the gunners, instead of shooting, placed themselves in front of their
          guns--as we read in one of the poems of the day, Rick's _Das Lied vom braven
          Kanonier_:</p>

        <p> "Vor der Burg in glühender Front, Des blutgen Befehls gewärtig, Vor der Burg in
          glühender Front, Da stehn die Kanonen fertig. Schon zittern die Thore, sie brechen schier,
          Jetzt gilt's, du braver Kanonier!</p>

        <p> Und du trittst vor die Mündung hin, Als wolltest du fesseln den Würger-- Und du rufst
          mit begeistertem Sinn: Erst mich! dann den wehrlosen Bürger!-- Dann schweigt das Commando,
          beschämt vor dir. Hab Dank, du braver Kanonier!"[2]</p>

        <p>Towards evening it became clear to Metternich that no concessions would now avail. He who
          for forty years had led the policy of Austria hurriedly gave in his resignation and made
          his escape in disguise in the imperial laundry cart. At nine o'clock the same evening the
          troops were withdrawn from Vienna (exactly a week before the same thing happened in
          Berlin), and citizens and students mounted guard everywhere. The arsenal was opened, and
          in one day arms were served out to 25,000 men.</p>

        <p>There was some severe fighting in the outskirts of the town. So fiercely resolute were
          the populace that, all unarmed, they pressed in upon and disarmed two companies of
          grenadiers who were defending the entrance to Metternichs villa. Those who resisted were
          trampled under foot.</p>

        <p>That same evening the abolition of the censorship and liberty of the press were publicly
          announced. The intimation produced a feeling of intense relief--it was as if a gag had
          been removed from the mouth of the nation.</p>

        <p><pb n="388"/> The newspapers, as a matter of course, instantaneously began to give
          expression to the popular political ideas. It had hitherto been impossible to treat even
          in poetic form any subject with a social or political tendency; Austria had resembled a
          forest where the voices of the birds were silent. Now suddenly pipe and call, whistle and
          song, were heard from every bush and tree, a mighty and confused chorus.[3]</p>

        <p>Poems of liberty were published in all the languages of Austria--German and Czech,
          Slavonian and Croatian, Hungarian, Polish, and Italian. So eager were men to make use of
          their new liberty that a whole bevy of poems, superscribed _Erstes censurfreies Gedicht_
          ("First poem printed after the abolition of the censure"), appeared simultaneously.</p>

        <p>The one generally accepted as the first is Frankl's _Die Universität_. During the night
          between the 14th and 15th of March, one of the professors, fearing an outbreak of the
          prisoners, requested the armed students to despatch a guard to one of the prisons. Twenty
          students were at once sent, under the command of Ludwig August Frankl. Whilst he stood on
          guard that young man gave expression to the feelings of the day in the song:</p>

        <p> "Was kommt heran mit kühnem Gange? Die Waffe blinkt, die Fahne weht, Es naht mit hellem
          Trommelklange Die Universität. . . . . . . . . . . Das freie Wort, das sie gefangen, Seit
          Joseph arg verhöhnt, verschmäht, Vorkämpfend sprengte seine Spangen Die Universität."</p>

        <p>In 1890, on his eightieth birthday, Frankl published a large volume of able poetry;
          during his long life he has been an unusually productive poet and writer of biography; he
          has been presented with the freedom of Vienna and of three other European and Asiatic
          towns; but this song, of <pb n="389"/> which in course of time at least a hundred thousand
          copies were printed, was what founded his reputation.</p>

        <p>It was not, however, really the first poem printed after the abolition of the censorship,
          for on the previous night Castelli had written his song of the _Garde-National._ In the
          German language alone there are three or four poems which lay claim to the same
          distinction. One of these is the song of the Vienna student brigade,_ Erwacht, erwacht o
          Brüder! Ein grosser Morgen tagt_ ("Awake, awake, O brothers! a great morning is dawning"),
          and another is Fr. Gerhard's _Die freie Presse_, which begins:</p>

        <p> "Die Presse frei! Die Glocken lasst ertönen Und läutet Jubel überall! Und ruft's hinaus
          zu Deutschlands fernsten Söhnen Die Presse frei, erstürmt der Freiheit Wall![4]</p>

        <p>Simultaneously with these poems, which express such an innocent, exuberant delight at
          being able to speak and write without restraint, there appeared others full of the most
          childish gratitude to the weak-minded Emperor. In them he is "the good Emperor," "our good
          Ferdinand," &amp;c, &amp;c. People were ready to forget immediately that every single
          concession had been, not granted, but forcibly extorted, or else they believed naïvely
          that this was the way to make their late oppressors forget it. In one of the many songs in
          praise of the Emperor we read:</p>

        <p> "Heil dir, mein Kaiser! in all der Lust Zu der sich dein Volk ermannt hat, Sei Dir vor
          Allen ein Heil gebracht, Den es immer als edel erkannt hat."[5]</p>

        <p>On the 16th of March the Hungarian deputation, 150 magnates with Kossuth at their head,
          rode into Vienna, through the Prater, welcomed with deafening cheers and showers of
          flowers. That day the number of armed citizens <pb n="390"/> had risen to 60,000. In the
          afternoon a herald appeared on the balcony of the Castle and read the following
          proclamation: "We, Ferdinand the First, by the grace of God Emperor of Austria and King of
          Hungary and Bohemia, of Lombardy and Venice, of Dalmatia, Croatia, Slavonia, Galicia,
          Illyria, &amp;c, have now, in agreement with the wishes of our faithful people, decided to
          take certain steps." On this introduction follows the announcement of the liberty of the
          press, the formation of the National Guard, and the convention of an assembly of deputies
          for the purpose of drafting "that constitution which we have determined to bestow on our
          country."</p>

        <p>Saphir sang:</p>

        <p> "Schwert aus der Scheid, aus dem Herzen das Lied! Stimmt an das Lied der Lieder!
          Jauchzend ertön' es durch Reihe und Glied, Jauchzend durch jubelnde Brüder! Blank wie die
          Waffe und hell wie der Stahl Klinge das Lied von der Garde-National."[6]</p>

        <p>Even the mocking-birds, we see, on this occasion ceased from mocking and found voice to
          join in the universal chorus. In the persistent employment of the French word, _Garde
          Nationale_, we have an example of the importation and imitation which so largely
          characterised the movement.</p>

        <p>In turning over the pages of a collection of the German political poems, several thousand
          in number, which were published in 1848 in Vienna alone, we come upon many unknown names,
          but also upon almost all that were well known at that time and on many that were destined
          to become famous. We are struck by a poem of Bauernfeld's, _Wien an die Provinzen_, weak
          from a literary point of view, but significant from its indication of the first sign of
          reaction, namely, an attempt made in the provinces to shake off what was called the
          tyranny of the capital; in other words, to counteract the influence of the example set by
          victorious, free Vienna. Friedrich Uhl, at a later period editor of the _Wiener
          Abendpost_, the official organ of the Government, writes a lament for the fallen
          revolutionary heroes:</p>

        <p> "Das schwarze Band, den schwarzen Flor Lasst in den Lüften wallen, Den Todten singt ein
          Klagelied, Die für die Freiheit gefallen."[7]</p>

        <p>There are poems to Lenau, the most popular of living Austrian poets, bewailing that the
          singer of liberty is now insane and silent, his ears deaf to the victors' joyful shouts.
          Richard Wagner, as yet unknown to fame, sends a "Greeting from Saxony to Vienna":</p>

        <p> "Ihr habt der Freiheit Art erkannt; Nicht halb wird sie gewonnen; Ist uns ihr kleinstes
          Glied entwandt, Schnell ist sie ganz zeronnen. Dies kleinste Glied ist unsre Ehre, Ehrlos
          ist, wer es lässt, Mit hellen Waffen, guter Wehre, Drum hieltet Ihr es fest."[8]</p>

        <p>Amongst the writers of serious poems we find names like Grillparzer and Hebbel; Saphir
          and Dingelstedt write mock-heroic elegies on the last of the censors, both of them
          parodies of Schiller's _Nadowessische Todesklage_; and there are no end of satiric thrusts
          at the King of Prussia, who, curiously enough, was considered to have acted heretofore in
          a more reactionary spirit, and now to be granting concessions more unwillingly than the
          Austrian Emperor.</p>

        <p>Since the beginning of March Berlin had been in a state of the wildest excitement.
          Directly after the Revolution of February the _Kreuzzeitung_ published an article
          advocating war with France. It awakened extreme anxiety; people asked each other if
          long-suffering Prussia was actually to be compelled to take up arms against the French
          Republic. It was in these days that all Germany began to deck itself in black, red, and
          gold, the colours symbolising unity and liberty. Freiligrath wrote of them:</p>

        <p> "In Kümmerniss und Dunkelheit Da mussten wir sie bergen, Nun haben wir sie doch befreit,
          Befreit aus ihren Särgen; Ha, wie das blitzt und rauscht und rollt! Hurrah, du Schwarz, du
          Roth, du Gold! Pulver ist schwarz, Blut ist roth, Golden flackert die Flamme!"[9]</p>

        <p>On the 7th of March the first great public meeting was held at In den Zelten. It was
          resolved to present an address to the King, demanding that he should immediately convene
          the Landtag and grant a constitution. The address ended with the words: "No war with
          France! Lawful liberty in our own country! Fraternal union of the whole great German
          nation!" On the 12th of March a regiment of cavalry charged the crowds at In den Zelten
          and dispersed them, but they collected again in town, built barricades, and attempted to
          seize a gunsmith's shop in the Jägerstrasse. Two men were killed in front of the Opera
          House. Under the windows of the Castle the people shouted "Liberty! Liberty of the press!"
          and insulted the sentries. On the 14th of March a general Landtag was summoned. So far
          things had been managed on the whole peaceably; but on the 15th of March the soldiers, who
          were worn out with night-watching, and with having to hold themselves in constant
          readiness in the barracks, began to behave roughly to the crowd, to strike with the
          butt-ends of their guns, &amp;c. Small barricades which some boys had erected at the
          corner of the Kurstrasse and the Gertraudenstrasse were charged by the Cuirassier Guards
          from Potsdam, and the boys were cruelly handled.</p>

        <p>At one o'clock on the 18th of March a royal proclamation was read in front of the Castle.
          It declared that Germany was to be from henceforth not a federation of States, but one
          federated State (Staatenbund--Bundesstaat), with a common Parliament, a common army,
          free-trade, liberty of emigration, and liberty of the press. At the end of each sentence
          the crowd answered with thundering hurrahs. Cries were heard of "Away with the soldiers!"
          and some stones were thrown. The famous General von Pfuel, who was in command, forbade the
          soldiers to fire, ordered the dragoons to dismount, and praised the discipline they showed
          in obeying at once, furious as they were. When the town seemed quiet he went home for a
          short time.</p>

        <p>During his absence, in consequence of an order given, no one knows by whom, though the
          embittered populace during the following days laid the blame of it on the Prince of
          Prussia, the future Emperor William, a regiment of dragoon guards arrived. The crowd
          shouted "Away!" The dragoons wheeled round, and the crowd were beginning to cry "Bravo!"
          when suddenly the soldiers charged in amongst them with naked swords. At the same moment a
          battalion of infantry marched out at the Castle gate, drew up in line, and also charged
          with levelled bayonets. Some shots were fired--possibly by accident. With loud shrieks the
          crowd instantaneously dispersed. Only a moment before joy had been at its height;
          strangers had been embracing each other, waving their hats, and shouting "Hurrah for the
          King"; now, as if at a preconcerted signal, barricades sprang up, as they had done in
          Vienna, over the whole town. There were two hundred of them, built of paving-stones,
          gutter-planking, and carts. The town was a camp. Men fired on the troops from every roof;
          those who could not get guns, threw stones. Every axe, every thick stick became a
          weapon.[10]</p>

        <p>The roofs were torn off corner houses, and paving-stones were carried up in baskets. The
          students met, armed, in front of the University, fastened tri-coloured cockades in their
          caps, and proceeded to man the barricades. Powder and shot, axes and iron bars, were
          provided by the merchants. On the evening of the 18th, the artillery opened fire in the
          Königstrasse. The King looked on from the windows of the Castle, incensed by the
          deputations that came entreating him to withdraw the troops, but at times condescending to
          jest; what specially annoyed him was the sight of the tri-coloured flags waving on the
          barricades. He was ready, he said, to concede much to entreaty, nothing to illegal
          violence.</p>

        <p>Varnhagen, in his Diary, describes what he saw and heard from his windows that night:
          "Asmall body of citizens under trusty leaders held the streets, doubly watchful because
          their numbers were so few. For a number of hours absolute darkness and silence prevailed;
          then, towards morning, the sound of far-off drums was heard; troops were evidently
          approaching. The citizen combatants were instantly on the alert; we could hear them
          whispering. A youthful voice gave the word of command: 'To the roofs, gentlemen!' and
          every man went to his post. This calm, determined command, given with noble simplicity,
          rang terrible and yet inspiring through the darkness. One felt the dangers which those who
          obeyed it were braving, for the general resistance was becoming weaker, and it seemed as
          if they were doomed, after a fruitless struggle, to meet an ignominious death, either by a
          fall from the roof, by the soldiers' bayonets, or by the hand of the executioner."
          Varnhagen concludes: "The heroic courage and determination of these daring youths was most
          undoubtedly worthy of all admiration"--weighty words, coming from the pen of an old,
          experienced officer.</p>

        <p>On the night between the 18th and 19th of March, wherever barricades were being erected
          or repaired, the windows were illuminated. But the moment troops entered the street all
          was darkness. The soldiers hewed and sabred right and left in the houses which they
          entered, and showed mediæval brutality in their treatment of prisoners. Towards morning
          the arsenal of the Garde-Landwehr regiment was captured by the insurgents; they found that
          the locks of the guns had been destroyed, but all the smiths of the quarter set to work
          and repaired the damage.</p>

        <p>At last, in the course of the morning, a royal proclamation headed _An meine lieben
          Berliner!_ was circulated, in which an attempt was made to explain the events of the day
          before as being the result of an unfortunate misunderstanding, "It had been necessary to
          clear the square in front of the Castle with cavalry, ordered to advance at a walking pace
          and with sheathed swords (_im Schritt und mit eingesteckter Waffe_); two infantry muskets
          had about this time gone off by accident, fortunately injuring no one; a company of
          evil-disposed individuals, chiefly strangers, had taken advantage of this unfortunate
          occurrence to stir up ideas of revenge in the minds of the excited crowd; the troops had
          used their weapons, but not until driven to do so by being repeatedly fired at. The King
          promises that the troops shall be withdrawn from Berlin, and concludes with the hope that
          both parties will forget what has happened."[11]</p>

        <p>Meanwhile the struggle raged on with frightful exasperation on both sides. In treating
          with the deputations that waited on him on the morning of the 19th of March, the King
          attempted to make his promise of withdrawing the troops conditional on the dismantling of
          the barricades. But in the end everything was conceded--change of ministry, release of the
          prisoners taken during the night, and withdrawal of the troops. Amidst the shouts of the
          rejoicing crowd, to muffled beat of drum and Chorale-music, the soldiers were marched off
          to Potsdam, feeling that they had sustained a deadly insult at the hands of their royal
          commander-in-chief.</p>

        <p>An enormous crowd thronged to the Castle, partly consisting of those who hoped by the
          force of numbers to exercise pressure on their vanquished rulers, partly of curious
          idlers; all the funeral processions from the streets where there had been fighting also
          made their way there. The corpses were borne on biers, or, where the numbers were too
          great, conveyed in open waggons, decorated with flowers, ribbons, and scarves, the corpses
          too being decked with flowers.</p>

        <p>Every available space in the neighbourhood of the Castle was closely packed. The crowd
          demanded to see the King. With a pale face he stepped out on the balcony. "Set the
          prisoners free!" shouted the crowd, and he was actually obliged to order the release of
          all those who were confined in the cellars of the Castle. The next proceeding was the
          carrying of many of the most severely wounded insurrectionists into the Castle, where
          their wounds were dressed. Now the funeral processions began to arrive, a sight by which
          the crowd was thrown into a state of the wildest agitation. Whilst the corpses were being
          carried into one of the apartments on the first floor of the Castle, one orator after
          another addressed the people. The speech which met with most approval was one made by Karl
          Gutzkow, the refrain of which was "general arming of the citizens." This the newly
          appointed ministers, who were moving about among the crowd, vainly attempting to pacify
          them, were loth to concede, but they were soon compelled to do so, for a scene which
          occurred at this juncture made it impossible to resist the demands of the people.</p>

        <p>A new funeral procession arrived--four corpses were borne on flower-decked biers through
          the crowd, their bloody wounds exposed to view for the purpose of rousing the beholders to
          revenge. The biers were deposited below the King's balcony, and the bearers raised a wild
          shout of "The King! The Queen!" which found a thousand-fold echo among the crowd. Two of
          the new ministers, Schwerin and Arnim, tried in vain to gain a hearing; their voices were
          drowned in the cry of "The King! The Queen!"</p>

        <p>When the King and Queen actually appeared, on the balcony the people's frenzy knew no
          bounds. The King to speak, but the bearers held high the biers with their bloody burdens,
          and the crowd yelled "Off with your hat!" And as each corpse was carried past the King was
          obliged to uncover.[12] In Freiligrath's grand poem, _Die Todten an die Lebenden_, written
          in the following year, the year of disillusion, we read:</p>

        <p> "Die Kugel mitten durch die Brust, die Stirne breit gespalten, So habt Ihr uns auf
          blutgem Brett hoch in die Luft gehalten! Hoch in die Luft mit wildem Schrei, das unsre
          Schmerzgeberde Den, der zu tödten uns befahl, ein Fluch auf ewig werde! Dass er sie sehe
          Tag und Nacht, im Wachen und im Traume-- Im Oeffnen seines Bibelbuchs und im
          Champagnerschaume! Dass wie ein Brandmal sie sich tief in seine Seele brenne: Dass
          nirgendwo und nimmermehr er vor ihr fliehen könne! Dass jeder qualverzogene Mund, dass
          jede rothe Wunde Ihn schrecke noch, ihn ängste noch in seiner letzten Stunde!"[13]</p>

        <p>On the 21st of March, at noon, the King rode out at the Castle gate with a black, red,
          and gold band on his arm, and himself distributed black, red, and gold favours. He was
          followed by the royal princes and the Ministers, who were in despair at the humiliating
          proceeding; at his side rode a veterinary surgeon, Urban by name. One of his generals had
          in vain attempted to dissuade him from taking this step. He answered: "Non, non, c'est
          décidé, nous allons monter à cheval." Presently he drew rein and spoke as follows: "I am
          usurping no man's right when I declare that I believe myself called to be the saviour of
          the unity and liberty of Germany--that unity and liberty, based on a free constitution, I
          will defend with the aid of German loyalty." At the University he called for the
          professors and students, and said to them: "Schreiben Sie sich's auf, meine Herren! Write
          down my words to you, for they are for posterity. I place myself at the head of the German
          nation; with its unity and liberty the existence of Prussia is henceforth inseparably
          bound up. Write that down!" At the arsenal, when he was again pouring forth promises, a
          piercing voice suddenly cried: "Don't believe him, he is lying; he has always lied, and he
          is lying now. Tear me in pieces if you like, but I say he is lying--don't believe
          him!"</p>

        <p>In Vienna, a few days later, the following poem appeared:</p>

        <p> "PREUSSISCHE MISSVERSTAENDNISSE. Im grossen ungläubigen Altberlin sind nun die Wunder zu
          Hause, Da wird geschossen, gestürmt, gebrannt zwei Tage ohne Pause, Bis tausende liegen im
          rothen Sand. Den König betrübt die Wendniss: Die Flinten gingen von selber los. Das war
          nur ein Missverständniss.</p>

        <p> Durch's grosse, ungläubige Altberlin gehn wunderbare Witze, Ein König hüllt sich in
          Schwarz-Roth-Gold und stellt sich an Deutschlands Spitze, Ein König wird Ober-Demagog mit
          deutsch einheitlicher Sendniss, Doch Deutschland lacht und ruft mit Macht: Das ist ein
          Missverständniss."[14]</p>

        <p>Another poem that bears witness to the irritated, sarcastic feeling provoked by the
          events of these days is entitled _Erlkönig_, and begins:</p>

        <p> "Wer schiesst noch so spät auf's Volk ohne Wehr? Es ist ein König mit seinem Heer. Er
          hält sein Volk so treu im Arm, Er fasst es so sicher mit seinen Gendarmes.</p>

        <p> O Bürger, o Bürger, o hörest du nicht Was Erlkönig in der Zeitung verspricht,"
          &amp;c.</p>

        <p>The Revolution of March in the capitals of Germany did not call forth any particularly
          fine poetical effusions; it gave rise chiefly to street songs, inflammatory and ephemeral
          verse; but the counter revolutions, the terrible re-capture of Vienna in October and of
          Berlin in November 1848, inspired a whole host of fine poems. The poets also found
          inspiration in the martyr deaths of individual liberationists, who either fell in fight or
          were murdered judicially after the suppression of the revolution. The insurrection of
          Hungary, too, with its suppression by the Russian army, awakened a sympathy which found
          expression in touching poems.</p>

        <p>The enthusiastic ecstasy in Vienna was of short duration. The democrats did not consider
          the free constitution free enough. A central political committee was formed as a sort of
          check on the government. The existence of such a body was declared to be illegal, but
          popular pressure compelled the government to retract this declaration and to suspend the
          constitution. In the beginning of May the Emperor fled to Innsbruck. An attempt was made
          to disband the student brigade, but as this led to a renewal of barricade fighting, the
          ministry were obliged to desist. The Emperor returned in August. During all this time the
          capital was in a most excited state; the revolution had put a stop to every kind of
          business, and the want of employment increased discontent and restlessness. A deep
          impression was made by the intelligence of the events of June in Paris, Cavaignac's
          victory being regarded as equivalent to the suppression of the revolution in France. About
          the same time came the news that Jellatschitsch, the Ban of Croatia, was preparing to
          invade Hungary. Intercepted letters showed that in this proceeding he had the support of
          the Court of Vienna and of Latour, the Minister of War; and the consequence was that Count
          Lamberg, Latour's envoy, was torn to pieces by the mob on his arrival at Pesth (September
          28), and Latour himself, having declared his intention of despatching troops to Hungary,
          was killed (October 7) by the enraged populace of Vienna. In his poem, _Der 7 Oktober_,
          which is a eulogy of the murdered man, Dingelstedt takes the opportunity to dissociate
          himself from the revolution and all its doings.</p>

        <p>The Emperor now fled from Vienna for the second time. Whilst Radetzky suppressed the
          insurrection in Lombardy, Windischgrätz, who had been appointed commander-in-chief,
          surrounded the capital with his troops. In a struggle which lasted from the 24th to the
          29th of October the outworks and outlying parts of the town were captured, and the city
          had already been driven by want of provisions and ammunition to agree to the unconditional
          capitulation demanded by Windischgrätz, when the cry was heard in the streets: "The
          Hungarians are coming." They had been seen from the tower of St. Stephen's Church. There
          was great rejoicing. The agreement to surrender was disregarded, the arms which had
          already been given up were again seized at the arsenals, and sorties were made to support
          the Hungarians, whose cannonading was now heard. But the Hungarian army was completely
          routed by Jellatschitsch. Windischgrätz entered Vienna on the 31st of October, followed by
          Jellatschitsch on the 2nd of November. A state of siege was proclaimed, and
          court-martials, sentences of death, and executions became the order of the day.</p>

        <p>Simultaneously with the elections for the first German Parliament in Frankfort-on-Main,
          elections went on in Prussia for the Prussian Constitutional Assembly, which was opened by
          the King in May. This body numbered few eminent members, the best men having been sent to
          Frankfort. Berlin was in an almost anarchic condition; the arsenal was stormed and
          plundered, the political clubs terrorised and coerced the Assembly. It rejected the
          constitution proposed by the government as not sufficiently democratic. The result of this
          was a first change of ministry. The new ministry made proposals which coincided more
          closely with the wishes of the Assembly, but found themselves unable to agree to the
          demand of the majority that it should be made a point of honour with all officers who
          disapproved of the new constitution to leave the army. A third ministry, with Pfuel for
          its leader, was formed. On the last day of October, while the Assembly was debating an
          appeal to the government "to support, by every means in its power, the cause of popular
          liberty, at present endangered in Vienna," a mob broke in on the meeting, attempted to
          influence its decision by violent means, and insulted the Pfuel ministry. Then this
          ministry too resigned, and on the 2nd of November the King put the reins of government
          into the hands of a war ministry, with his step-uncle, Count Brandenburg, at its head.
          This new government decreed the transference of the Assembly from Berlin to Brandenburg,
          and brought the troops that had just returned from Denmark under General Wrangel to
          Berlin. The citizens were disarmed and a state of siege was proclaimed.</p>

        <p>The revolutions of Vienna and Berlin had been fruitless; alike fruitless were the
          proceedings of the first German Parliament (Reichstag), which met at Frankfort on the 18th
          of May 1848, and was forcibly dispersed by troops at Stuttgart on the 18th of June 1849.
          The President it chose, Archduke John, did his best to subject it to the domination of
          Austria; it made a vain offer of the imperial crown of Germany to Frederick William IV. in
          April 1849; its sacred inviolability was disregarded as early as November 1848, when
          Windischgrätz ordered the execution of one of its members, Robert Blum, at Brigittenau; it
          lost importance as a representative assembly by the gradual desertion of its conservative
          members. When it was dispersed at Stuttgart, the reaction was once more triumphant
          throughout Europe:</p>

        <p> "Da sah man die letzten der Getreuen, Die ausgeharrt beim Heiland, zerstreuen Sich,
          wandernd nach alien Seiten und Winden, Das Wort des Heiles zu verkünden, Wohl wissend,
          dass ein langes Exil Und Armuth, Noth und Dulden ihr Ziel, Und Qual und Tod und
          Kerkermauern. 'Das Wort des Heils wird sie überdauern' Das merkt euch, ihr Knechte und
          blutigen Horden: Das Wort ist Fleisch und ist Gott geworden.[15]</p>

        <p>Thus sang Moritz Hartmann, one of the last of the faithful. He rightly felt that the
          ideas survived the outward changes.</p>

        <p>By the end of 1848 the poets of the revolution had nothing left to sing of but fallen
          heroes and extinguished hopes. Among these poets Freiligrath and Hartmann rank highest,
          and as typical of the elegies written on the fallen heroes, we may take the verses
          composed by these two authors on Robert Blum, whose firm, gentle character, simplicity,
          and prudence, stamped him in the minds of his contemporaries as the ideal of a popular
          leader.</p>

        <p>In his _Reimchronik_ Hartmann writes mournfully:</p>

        <p> "So ruhe sanft und gut, mein Robert! Nicht braucht's der Wunsch, dass leicht dir werde
          Die blutgetränkte Wiener Erde, Der Boden, den du dir erobert. Du bist nicht todt, trotz
          aller Klage Des deutschen Volks, trotz aller Lieder. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Ein
          Mythus geht: der Robert lebt, Der Robert Blum, den sie erschossen Und jedes deutsche Herz
          erbebt: Das theure Blut ist nicht geflossen-- Die Hoffnung raunt uns in die Ohren:
          Entflort, entflort die Trikoloren, Noch, noch ist Deutschland nicht verloren. . . . . . .
          . . . . . . . . . Allüberall ist der dabei! Er wendet mit den Geisterhänden Und fängt mit
          seiner Brust das Blei, Das uns die Fürstenväter senden. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Und
          wandeln muss er, bis entrafft Das deutsche Volk sich dem Verräther Bis er entfürstet und
          entpfafft Den heilgen Boden seiner Väter."[16]</p>

        <p>And a week after Blum's death, Freiligrath writes the magnificent verses on the
          commemoration service in the Cathedral of Cologne, where the mighty organ pealed forth
          Neukomm's requiem music:</p>

        <p> "Und heut in diesem selben Köln zum Weh'n des Winterwindes Und zu der Orgel Brausen
          schallt das Grablied dieses Kindes. Nicht singt die Ueberlebende, die Mutter, es dem
          Sohne: Das ganze schmerzbewegte Köln singt es mit festem Tone. Es spricht: Du, deren
          Schoos ihn trug, bleib still auf deinem Kammer! Vor deinem Gott, du graues Haupt,
          ausströme deinen Jammer; Auch ich bin seine Mutter, Weib! Ich und noch eine Hohe-- Ich und
          die Revolution, die hohe, lichterlohe! Bleib du daheim mit deinem Schmerz! wir wahren
          seine Ehre-- Des Robert Requiem singt Köln, die revolutionäre. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
          . . . . . . . . . Was greift ihr zu den Schwertern nicht, Ihr Singer und Ihr Beter? Was
          werdet Ihr Posaunen nicht, Ihr ehr'nen Orgeltuben, Den jüngsten Tag ins Ohr zu schrein den
          Henkern und den Buben? Den Henkern, die ihn hingestreckt auf der Brigittenaue-- Auf festen
          Knien lag er da im ersten Morgenthaue! Dann sank er hin--hin in sein Blut--lautlos!--heut
          vor acht Tagen! Zwei Kugeln haben ihm die Brust, eine das Haupt zerschlagen."[17]</p>

        <p>It is to Hartmann's _Reimchronik des Pfaffen Mauritius_ that we must have recourse if we
          desire to view all the successive events and impressions of 1848 in the mirror of poetry.
          Many of the details of this poem have become difficult to understand; the reader of to-day
          comes upon lists of names, of whose owners he knows little or nothing--men like
          Bassermann, the parliamentary debater, and Hansemann, the financier, in their day famous
          members of the Parliament of Frankfort, now forgotten--but from parts of it, without the
          assistance of any commentary, he gains a vivid impression of men's feelings, of their
          exalted frame of mind, in that year of revolution. Very affecting is a final outburst, in
          which the poet bewails the want of men:</p>

        <p> "Ich seh' Gelehrte und Professoren Und Präsidenten und Assessoren, Weinküfer seh' ich
          und Redakteure Superintendenten und Accoucheure Und Börsenleute und Zeitungsschreiber,
          Astronomen und Steuereintreiber, Lumpenhändler und Alterthumskenner, Biedermänner,
          Hansemänner, Bassermänner-- Allein wo sind die _Männer_, die _Männer?_ "[18]</p>

        <p>When Hartmann wrote these words he was living on the shores of the Lake of Geneva, a
          banished man, and the best men of Germany and Austria who had survived the great
          discomfiture were either in prison or, like himself, in exile.</p>

        <p>1848 is a year of no decisive political significance, although it was in this year that
          the old order of things was for the first time disturbed simultaneously in almost every
          country of Europe. The local revolutions of 1789 and 1830, whatever they resulted in, were
          successful revolutions, but the general European revolution of 1848 was nothing in any
          single country but an unsuccessful attempt.</p>

        <p>Yet 1848 is a year of great spiritual significance. After it men feel and think and write
          quite otherwise than they did before it. In literature it is the red line of separation
          that divides our century and marks the beginning of a new era. It was a year of jubilee,
          like that instituted by the old Hebrew law, that fiftieth year, in which the trumpet was
          to be sounded throughout all the land, which was to be hallowed, and in which liberty was
          to be proclaimed "throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof" (Lev. xxv. 8,
          &amp;c). This year, with its quick heart-beat, its all-subduing youthful ardour, was, like
          that Bible year of jubilee, a year of returning into possession, a year of redemption, in
          which "they that had been sold were redeemed again." To this day we imbibe youthful
          enthusiasm from its days of March and learn important lessons from its days of
          November.</p>

        <p>It is the year of jubilee, the year of mourning, the boundary year.</p>

        <p>[1] 'Twas in the mountains the first shot was fired--in the mountains, against the
          priests! That shot loosened the avalanche--three countries sprang to arms! Switzerland can
          already rest on her laurels; the eternal mountains are trembling to their centres with
          joy.</p>

        <p>The sport soon spread to Italy--Scylla and Charybdis, Vesuvius and Etna broke loose;
          explosion upon explosion, blow upon blow!' "This is becoming serious, my royal, my
          imperial brother!" is the message from Vienna to Berlin, from Berlin to Vienna; even Nick
          begins to tremble.</p>

        <p>And now the paving-stones are once more torn up, the stones of those streets on to which
          ere now two kings have been ruthlessly flung by armed liberty.</p>

        <p>[2] In front of the castle in threatening line stand the cannon, awaiting the word of
          command--the gates are shuddering and yielding--the moment has come, brave gunner!</p>

        <p>Forward to the muzzle he goes, as if the order had been to stop the mouths of the
          destroyers; fearlessly he cries: "First me, then the defenceless citizen!"--No farther
          command is given. Thou hast shamed them! All thanks to thee, brave gunner!</p>

        <p>[4] The press is free! Peal the bells! sound the glad tidings far and wide! Proclaim to
          the farthest-off of Germany's sons: The press is free, the ramparts of liberty are

        <p>[5] All hail to thee, my Emperor! Full of joy in their accomplished work, thy people
          greet thee, whom they have always known to be of noble mind.</p>

        <p>[6] As your swords leap from their scabbards, let a song, O my brothers, come from your
          hearts! Let the song of songs resound through your rejoicing ranks--bright as burnished
          armour, clear as ringing steel, the song of the Garde-National!</p>

        <p>[7] Let the black draperies flutter in the wind, and let a sad lament resound for those
          who have laid down their lives in the cause of liberty.</p>

        <p>[8] Ye have rightly understood the nature of liberty; we cannot half possess her; if we
          but let her little finger be taken from us, she will soon be gone. That little finger is
          our honour. Who lets that go knows not what honour is. Therefore with strong arms and good
          swords ye have defended it.</p>

        <p> In secret hiding-place and gloom Long time we have concealed it; But now at last the day
          is come, The day that has revealed it. Ha! how the smoke is round it rolled! Hurrah! thou
          Black and Red and Gold! Powder is black, Blood is red, Golden glows the flame!

        <p> With bullets through and through our breast--our forehead split with spike and spear, So
          bear us onward shoulder-high, laid dead upon a blood-stained bier; Yea, shoulder-high
          above the crowd, that on the man that bade us die, Our dreadful death-distorted face may
          be a bitter curse for aye; That he may see it day and night, or when he wakes or when he
          sleeps, Or when he opes his holy book, or when with wine high revel keeps; That ever like
          a scorching brand that sight his secret soul may burn; That he may ne'er escape its curse,
          nor know to whom for aid to turn; That always each disfeatured face, each gaping wound his
          sight may sear, And brood above his bed of death, and curdle all his blood with fear!</p>

        <p>[14] PRUSSIAN MISUNDERSTANDINGS.</p>

        <p>The big, incredulous town of Berlin has become the home of miracles. For two whole days
          they have been shooting, storming, burning there without a pause; thousands are lying in
          the bloody dust. The King is distressed by what has occurred; he says: "The guns went off
          of themselves; the whole has been a misunderstanding."</p>

        <p>In the old, incredulous town of Berlin strange tricks are being played; a King decks
          himself in black, red, and gold, and declares himself to be the leader of Germany, the
          arch-demagogue, chosen of heaven to bring about German unity. But Germany only laughs and
          shouts: "This is a misunderstanding."</p>

        <p>[15] Then the last of the faithful, who had remained true to their saviour, scattered to
          the four winds of heaven, to proclaim the word of salvation, knowing full well that what
          awaited them was exile and poverty, want and suffering, torture, imprisonment, and death.
          "The word of salvation will survive them"; note this, ye slaves, ye bloody hordes: The
          word has become flesh, has become God.</p>

        <p>[16] Rest peacefully, rest well, my Robert! No need is there for us to wish that light
          upon thy breast may lie the blood-drenched earth of Vienna, the soil thy valour captured.
          Thou art not dead, despite the loud laments and songs of mourning of the German people....
          From mouth to mouth spreads the report: "Our Robert lives, that Robert Blum the tyrants
          shot"--and every German heart beats high. That precious blood has not been shed; hope
          whispers in our ears: "The tri-coloured standard is trailed in the dust, but Germany is
          not lost."... He is with us everywhere! With his spirit hands he turns back the bullets,
          or receives them in his breast--these bullets rained on us by our paternal rulers.... A
          wanderer he, until the German people have released themselves from the betrayer's grip,
          until he has cleared the sacred land of his fathers, of princes and of priests.</p>

        <p> In this same city of Cologne, 'mid moaning winds of winter wild, To-day in deepest
          organ-tones resounds the grave-song of this child. 'Tis not the mother bow'd in grief who
          sings it o'er her fallen son; Nay, all Cologne bewails the death of him whose toil too
          soon is done. With solemn woe the city speaks: Thou who didst bear the noble dead, Remain
          to weep within thy home, and bow to earth thine aged head; I also am his mother! Yea, and
          yet a mightier one than I, I and the Revolution's self, for whom he laid him down to die.
          Stay thou within and nurse thy woe. 'Tis we will do him honour here; 'Tis we will watch
          and requiem sing for thy dead son upon his bier. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
          . . . . . . . Why grasp ye not your swords in wrath, O ye that sing and ye that pray? Ye
          organ-pipes, to trumpets turn, and fight the scoundrels with your breath, And din into
          their dastard ears the dreadful news of sudden death, Those scoundrels who the order gave,
          the cruel murder dared to do-- The hero leant him on his knee in that autumnal morning's
          dew, Then silent fell upon his face in blood--'tis eight short days ago-- Two bullets
          smote him on the breast, and laid his head for ever low. (JOYNES.)</p>

        <head>CONCLUSION</head>

        <p>It is a mighty panorama, this, which the study of the feelings and thoughts of Germany,
          first oppositionist, then revolutionary, between 1815 and 1848, unrolls to our view. We
          see the spirit of Metternich, a spirit of shallowness, brooding over Austria and the whole
          of Germany. We follow the new intellectual movement from the time when it first finds
          expression at the Wartburg Festival in 1817. We see how the assassination of Kotzebue
          gives occasion to the open persecution of Liberalism and introduces a long period of
          ruthless reaction and oppression, during which Goethe is regarded as the Quietist foe of
          liberty and lauded or denounced as such, and German philosophy under the auspices of Hegel
          becomes, in a rather questionable manner, conservative. The oppositionist tendency finds
          occasional expression in the writings of poets like Chamisso, Platen, and Heine, but the
          general intellectual condition is one of depression, relieved by outbursts of
          self-ridicule. The state of stagnation is put an end to by the news of the Revolution of
          July 1830, which electrifies public feeling and gives both poets and prose writers new
          courage and fresh inspiration. The remembrance of Byron's life and death influences men in
          the same direction, and the Polish revolt awakens sympathy and enthusiasm in spite of the
          part that Germany takes in the annihilation of Poland as a nation. Börne becomes the most
          eminent advocate of Liberalism in politics, holds high the banner of liberty and justice,
          shows a noble example in the matter of strength of character and conviction, but at the
          same time displays a naïve and fanatical optimism which proves that his is not the
          temperament required in a statesman. In Heine, the greatest poet of the period, we feel
          the vibration of its every nerve. In him modern poetry casts off the swaddling-clothes of
          Romanticism. In love, in appreciation of nature, in his political, social, and religious
          views, in his descriptive, poetic, and satiric style, he is the man of our own
          day--fitter, as we pointed out, than any other to grapple with modern life in its hardness
          and ugliness, its charm and its restlessness, and its wealth of violent contrasts. About
          the same time, in a different and yet kindred manner, Immermann, in his best book, marks
          the transition to a more realistic style of art.</p>

        <p>The Revolution of July had not only changed the tone of literature, it had also altered
          the character of the Hegelian philosophy, which from this time onwards is to be regarded
          as one of the strongest influences in the revolutionising of men's conception of life;
          from the doctrines of the master who died such a strong Conservative, his pupils draw
          reformatory or revolutionary inferences and principles. And now, with the echoes of the
          Revolution of July sounding in their ears, appear a group of young authors; they are
          influenced by the philosophy of Hegel and the poetry of Goethe, this last interpreted as
          anti-Christian; Heine and Börne are their masters, Rahel and George Sand their muses; they
          come to be known by the name of Young Germany. They desire to assimilate literature with
          life, to subvert existing religious and moral doctrines, to introduce a freer morality in
          the matter of marriage and divorce and a new species of pantheistic piety. The impeachment
          of these men by Menzel in 1835 is the signal for a new series of persecutions directed
          against all that in that day went by the name of the literature of movement
          (Bewegungslitteratur). Very few of the representatives of the young generation show
          strength of character when thus put to the test, but both the highly gifted men (Gutzkow)
          and those of moderate ability (Laube, &amp;c.) develop their talents amidst these
          persecutions, and works are produced which accurately mirror the hopes and struggles of
          the age, the thoughts and feelings, temptations, mistakes, and victories of the
          individual.</p>

        <p>Between the years 1830 and 1840 something has been happening quietly, deep down in men's
          minds--Goethe's poetry and Goethe's philosophy of life, at first championed exclusively by
          enthusiastic women, have been steadily gaining influence over the cultivated, making them
          proof against theological impressions but receptive to all great human ideas. The cult of
          Goethe leads by degrees, even in the case of women, to the cult of political liberty and
          social reform.</p>

        <p>In 1840 German philosophy begins to develop in the direction of Radicalism, and the poets
          begin openly to advocate the cause of political liberty. The men of this new generation,
          too, owe their philosophic training to Hegel, but they have metamorphosed his doctrine
          into an atheistical, anti-monarchical doctrine. They regard the standpoint of Young
          Germany with contempt as being purely belletristic, and busy themselves with the nature of
          Christianity and the idea of the state.</p>

        <p>On the throne of Prussia at this juncture sits a king with a curiously complex character
          and many talents, a typical transition figure, whose personality, especially in its
          relation to the literature and intellectual life of the day, is of great interest. In the
          south of Germany it is Metternich, in the north it is Frederick William IV., who outwardly
          regulates the course of events. We see literary and political celebrities being attracted
          by him, coming into collision with him, and rebounding from him. The invalids of
          literature, men like Tieck and Schelling, pass their last days under his protection;
          Herwegh and Freiligrath are first attracted and then repelled by him; Jacoby attacks him,
          Dingelstedt ridicules him.</p>

        <p>And now we follow the development of political poetry, from its founder Anastasius Grün
          to Herwegh and Dingelstedt, observing what a deep impression such a thinker as Ludwig
          Feuerbach makes on the intellectual life of his contemporaries. Men like Freiligrath and
          Prutz, Sallet and Hartmann, are the petrels that foretell the storm; in 1848 we hear the
          song of certain gifted poets high above the roar of the political hurricane, and we also
          notice that these unexampled occurrences transform men of minor or undeveloped talent into
          organs of the great movement of the hour.</p>

        <p>During our study of this fragment of literary history we have passed in review a whole
          gallery of remarkable figures, devoting careful attention to the most important or most
          typical.</p>

        <p>We saw how Napoleon's great personality, in its legendary form, exercised almost as
          powerful an influence on men's minds as Byron's. Of the great intellectual forces of the
          eighteenth century, Goethe, Jean Paul, Heinse, and Hegel are those by which our period is
          most perceptibly influenced. Some of the Romanticists influence as teachers and masters
          (Wilhelm Schlegel, Brentano, Chamisso), others as antagonists (Tieck). Börne and Heine,
          geniuses of most dissimilar types, by virtue of that polemical quality which was an
          essential characteristic of both, influence the whole period.</p>

        <p>What a wealth of remarkable, original characters! Glance at our gallery of women--Rahel
          and Bettina, the friends of Goethe; Börne's friends, Henrietta Herz and Jeannette Wohl;
          Heine's La Mouche, Immermann's Elisa, and Princess Pückler and Charlotte Stieglitz--gifted
          women and devoted wives! Or let your eyes wander over our collection of male
          portraits--authors and men of the world, like Varnhagen and Pückler; stiff, stately
          figures, like Platen and Immermann; others that are all life and fire, like Börne and
          Heine; manly eccentrics, like Jacoby; kingly figures, like Feuerbach; grimacing fanatics,
          like Menzel; independent poets great and small, like Rückert, Hebbel, Ludwig, and
          Scherenberg; agitators, like Wienbarg and Gutzkow; men of pliant talent, like Laube and
          Mundt; weak desponders, like Stieglitz; bold singers of liberty, like Hoffmann and
          Freiligrath; immature characters, like Herwegh; problematic characters, like Dingelstedt
          and Meissner; brave men, like Sallet, Hartmann, and Prutz. Even when their productions are
          not of the highest quality, we study the men themselves with interest.</p>

        <p> * * * * *</p>

        <p>And yet what is presented in this volume can only be fully understood by those who read
          it in its connection with the earlier volumes of the work of which it forms a part, who
          regard it in the light of the last act of a great historic drama. The plan of the work is
          indicated in the introduction to the first volume, and is strictly adhered to throughout
          all six.</p>

        <p>The author's intention, as explained in the first lines of his work, was, by means of the
          study of certain main groups and main movements in European literature, to outline a
          psychology of the first half of the nineteenth century. The year 1848, which, as a
          historical turning-point, marks a conclusion for the time being, was indicated as the
          point to which he intended to pursue his subject. The six groups which, according to the
          original plan, have been portrayed, are, the French Emigrant Literature, German
          Romanticism, the French Reaction, English Naturalism, French Romanticism, and Young
          Germany. Each one of the six parts of the work has in the course of years either been
          re-written or revised.</p>

        <p>The author's first proceeding was to separate and classify the chief literary movements
          of the first half of the century, his next to find their general direction or law of
          progression, a starting point, and a central point.</p>

        <p>The direction he discovered to be a great rhythmical ebb and flow--the gradual dying out
          and disappearing of the ideas and feelings of the eighteenth century until authority, the
          hereditary principle, and ancient custom once more reigned supreme, then the reappearance
          of the ideas of liberty in ever higher mounting waves. The starting point was now
          self-evident, namely, the group of French literary works denominated the Emigrant
          Literature, the first epoch-making one of which bears the date 1800. The central point was
          equally unmistakable. From the literary point of view it was Byron's death, from the
          political that Greek war of liberation in which he fell. This double event is epoch-making
          in the intellectual life and the literature of the Continent. The concluding point was
          also clearly indicated, namely, the European revolution of 1848. Byron's death forming the
          central point of the work, the school of English literature to which he belongs, became as
          it were the hinge on which it turned. The main outlines now stood out clearly: the
          incipient reaction in the case of the emigrants, held in check by the revolutionary ideas
          still in vogue; the growth of the reaction in the Germany of the Romanticists; its
          culmination and triumph during the first year of the Restoration in France; the turn of
          the tide discernible in what is denominated English Naturalism; the change which takes
          place in all the great writers of France shortly before the Revolution of July, a change
          which results in the formation of the French Romantic school; and, lastly, the development
          in German literature which issues in the events of March 1848.</p>

        <p>It is self-evident that the standpoint here adopted is a personal one. It is the personal
          point of view, the personal treatment, which presents literary personages and works thus
          grouped and ordered, thus contrasted, thus thrown into relief or cast into shadow.
          Regarded impersonally, the literature of a half-century is nothing but a chaos of hundreds
          of thousands of books in many languages.</p>

        <p>The personal standpoint is not, however, an arbitrary one. It has been the author's aim
          to do justice, as far as in him lay, to every single person and phenomenon he has
          described. No attempt has been made to fit any of them into larger or smaller places than
          they actually occupied. It is no whim or preconceived intention of the author that has
          given the work its shape. The power which has grouped, contrasted, thrown into relief or
          suppressed, lengthened or shortened, placed in full light, in half light, or in shadow, is
          none other than that never entirely conscious power to which we usually give the name of
          art.</p>

            <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
            <p>Georg Brandes’ second volume of <em>Main Currents</em> on German Romanticism,
                published in 1873, is characterized by discordance between judgement and
                understanding. He is possessed of a peculiar sense of the Romanticism toward which
                he directs all his critique; indeed, a segment of Brandes scholarship considers him
                to be an outright Romantic anti-Romantic. He shares this equivocal stance with his
                model, Heinrich Heine, who was a part of the “Young Germany” in the decades before
                the 1848 revolutions. Both criticize Romanticism and yet – if the period is defined
                elastically – belong to it: Heine is a part of Late Romanticism, while Brandes is
                situated in the middle of a still later age’s artistic and philosophical reception
                of Romanticism, which includes among others Richard Wagner (born 1813) and Friedrich
                Nietzsche (born 1844). </p>
            <p>It is not, however, this later iteration of Romanticism that Brandes describes in
                this volume. He views German Romanticism as a closed historical phase situated
                between the French Revolution of 1789 and the July Revolution of 1830, while Danish
                Romanticism, on the contrary, was still an influence on Danish cultural life at the
                time of Brandes’ writing – an influence that should be resisted. Against its
                idealism and its tendencies toward flight from reality, he advocates a liberal
                activism and a faith in the rights of the individual. Contemporary literature, with
                Romanticism as its contrast, should be mobilized in the service of progress and
                democratization. Romanticism thereby serves as the point from which a new
                orientation in Danish culture is to be launched.</p>
            <p>How does Brandes conceptualize Romanticism? His approach is twofold, in that on the
                one side he describes “the Romantic school” as a group of authors and works, and on
                the other “the Romantic” as a psychological-mental phenomenon and a variegated art
                form. Both approaches reveal that it is not his task to write a well-ordered and
                historically exhaustive literary history, but rather to paint a portrait, at the
                same time political, intellectual historical and psychological, of that which is
                uniquely German.</p>
            <p>The title phrase of <em>The Romantic School</em> is not of Brandes’ invention. It is
                a widespread designation in 19th century German literary criticism, from Heinrich
                Heine’s <em>Die romantische Schule</em> (1836) through Hettner’s <em>Die romantische
                    Schule in ihrem inneren Zusammenhange mit Goethe und Schiller</em> (1850) to
                Rudolf Haym, whose <em>Die romantische Schule</em> (1870) functions as the beginning
                of modern scholarship on Romanticism (Ansel 2003:247, Huggler 2006). The designation
                of “school” suggest both a unity and a common program in German Romanticism, which
                in contrast to later literary historiography does not take account of the
                multiplicity of the period and its various phases, from an Early Romanticism toward
                a National Romanticism to a Late Romanticism.</p>
            <p>Brandes is especially preoccupied with authors from before 1800, that is the Early
                Romantics: Novalis, Friedrich Schlegel, Ludwig Tieck, and W.H. Wackenroder, together
                with the Romantic women authors, Dorothea Schlegel and Caroline Schlegel-Schelling.
                The so-called national phase of Romanticism after the turn of the century is
                represented by Heinrich von Kleist and Zacharias Werner, the late period by
                especially E.T.A. Hoffman but also Joseph Eichendorff and Friedrich Fouqué. Achim
                von Arnim and Clemens Brentano are mentioned sporadically, and a transitional author
                between Classicism and Romanticism, Jean Paul, is viewed negatively as a forerunner
                of Romanticism. This text corpus is limited, but is later widened in Brandes’ second
                edition. His canon still has relevance to an extent, but today his work should not
                primarily be read as a literary history. The book has – like <em>Main Currents</em>
                in general – value as a literary psychology and history of mentalities typical of
                the age, as a work with a particular reception history and as an especially
                significant contribution to the cultural conflict in the Denmark of the age.</p>

        <div class="chapter">
            <h1>2. Background and Genesis</h1>

            <p>The German Reich was young in 1873, having been established in 1871 by virtue of
                Prussia’s three “wars of unification” against, respectively, Denmark (1864), Austria
                (1866) and France (1870-1). It was in the midst of the so-called
                    <em>Gründerzeit</em>, experiencing economic growth and industrial expansion.</p>
            <p> During his stay in 1872, Brandes quickly become enthusiastic for Germany, and he
                settled in the German capital during the years 1877-83. He begins <em>The Romantic
                    School in Germany</em> with a portrait of the country at present, which
                contrasts to both German society in the age of Romanticism around 1800 and to the
                Danish small state after 1864. Berlin is a modern big city marked by its industry,
                military and rationality, the country staunchly led by the “Iron Chancellor,” Otto
                von Bismarck. Through his characterization of a disciplined and future-oriented
                Germany, possessed of a common cause (also in literature), he sought to shake up his
                fellow Danes, to mobilize a new energy and force amidst national decline after the
                defeat of 1864. It is clear his portrait of the German faith in freedom and progress
                is idealized. In other places, not least in his big book <em>Berlin as the German
                    Capital</em>, Brandes unfolds a more nuanced and more critical vision of German
                political development and of Bismarck.</p>
            <p>In Denmark there had been gradual liberal reform of society after the introduction of
                the constitution in 1849, but after 1866 parliamentary rule had been scaled back
                following a constitutional revision in July of that year. Even after the failure of
                their Greater Denmark program in 1864, the National Liberals in alliance with the
                Conservatives fought to preserve their power and limit the influence of the new
                Venstre [Left] party. The period between 1870 and 1901 is politically defined by
                constitutional struggle and democratization. In this political landscape, in which
                the modern party system was established, Brandes formulates a wholly new radical
                liberal position. Even though his program largely cohered with that of the Venstre
                (Thomsen 1998:51), his <em>Main Currents</em> opened up a platform of argumentation
                from which he participated in the so-called culture wars, setting himself up as
                contrast to the bourgeois Conservatives and the new Social Democrats as well as the
                Grundtvigian project of enlightenment that was especially influential in the folk
                high school and cooperative movements.</p>
            <p>During the summer and fall of 1872, Brandes sought refuge in Dresden and Berlin from
                the commotion resulting from his first series of lectures on “emigrant literature,”
                and from the denial of the professorship in aesthetics at Copenhagen University that
                he had expected to receive. It was here that he prepared the second installment of
                his lecture series, on German Romanticism (Nolin 1965:56). The following year, in a
                six-week period between February 2nd and March 27th, Brandes delivered the twelve
                lectures. In this relatively brief period he not only managed to write and give the
                lectures, but also deliver the completed manuscript to the publisher (Knudsen
                1985:303); already in May of 1873 it appeared in book form.</p>
            <p>Very little scholarly material exists on this process (Bjerring-Hansen 2008:151), and
                the published volume received far less attention than <em>Emigrant Literature</em>
                had. The later publication history, on the contrary, was rather dramatic. Brandes
                initially revised the first German edition of the volume, which had also appeared in
                1873, publishing a second German version in 1887, which served as the foundation for
                the Danish second edition, appearing in 1891. The second edition contains 15-20 per
                cent more material (Bjerring-Hansen 2008:153), adding new German Romantics in new
                chapters: W.H. Wackenroder, A.W. Schlegel, Friedrich Hölderlin, Adelbert von
                Chamisso, Achim von Arnim, Clemens Brantano, and Joseph von Görres. Brandes further
                adds a section on the Danish poet Schack von Staffeldt and another on Scandinavian
                Romanticism at the end (Knudsen 1994:407-8). He tones down his judgmental rhetoric,
                for example changing the chapter headings on the “negative” and “positive” pioneers
                of Romanticism to merely “The Pioneers of Romanticism.” Likewise, the most radical
                assertions, for example that “Romanticism was poisoned by its sources” (Brandes
                1873:21), are removed. Altered descriptions, for example of Novalis (Bjerring-Hansen
                2008:156) and of Heinrich von Kleist, can be located sporadically. Through the use
                of author names as chapter headings, the presentation in general becomes more
                biographical, more monograph-like, and Brandes draws to a greater degree on
                authorial biographies as source material. Its character as a document of the culture
                wars is lessened, and the book becomes less a local Danish work and more broadly
                European in its perspective. These differences shall be addressed in the following
                (see also the section on Reception and Afterlife).</p>
            <p>
                <em>Main Currents</em> describes a macro-historical, spiritual and intellectual
                historical course of development toward reason and freedom. This historical vision
                is inspired by G.W.F Hegel, whose philosophy had exerted immense influence on Danish
                cultural life in the decades before Brandes began his career. Brandes’ reception is
                marked by German Young Hegelianism, which in the 1830s and 1840s continued Hegel’s
                method dialectical thinking, politically and socially radicalizing it in the
                struggle for social change in conservative Prussia. Brandes’ periodization is
                determined by the dialectical relation between political action and reaction.</p>
            <p>In the second volume, German Romanticism functions negatively as a period of reaction
                following the French Revolution, which only gave way to new action in the July
                Revolution of 1830. Brandes’ critique is strongly inspired by G.W.F. Hegel and
                Heinrich Heine, but in Germany after the failure of the bourgeois revolution in
                1848-9, a new and more moderate liberal and nationally-oriented form of criticism
                took hold. Brandes employs the pre-1848 aggressive rhetoric of the Young Hegelian
                Arnold Ruge as well as the more tempered critique of the liberal Hettner and his
                contemporary Haym (Nolin 1965:57-9). The different tendencies of the texts
                sporadically manifest themselves as ambiguities in Brandes’ evaluations.</p>

        <h1>3. Methodology, Concepts and Themes in <em>The Romantic School in Germany</em></h1>

        <p>This sections first sketches out Brandes’ methodology (a) and his cultural-political
            employment of Romanticism (b). Next, his complex conception of modernity is
            characterized (c). Brandes works with both a social and an aesthetic conception of
            modernity, which is closely tied to his critique of idealism and his portrait of Goethe,
            which also contains a definite conception of form (d).</p>
        <p>Central to the book is Brandes’ thesis on the Romantic and specifically German mentality,
            which is charted in the three middle chapters on soul [gemyt], longing and reflection
            (e). Brandes discusses Romantic individualism in a dialogue with both Goethe and Søren
            Kierkegaard (f). Finally, it shall be demonstrated how Brandes views the themes that are
            important to his program for the Modern Breakthrough, namely love and gender (g) along
            with politics (h). These thematic areas correspond to the chapters in <em>The Romantic
                School in Germany</em>, which shall be regularly referenced and cited.</p>
        <div>
            <h2>a. Brandes’ Organizing Principle and Methodology</h2>
            <p>Brandes does not arrange his material chronologically, but thematically into areas
                such as sociality, music, art, description of nature, politics, and central Romantic
                concepts such as psychology, soul and longing, all of which are categories in which
                the anthropological-social and poetological-aesthetic are combined. Yet a timeline
                is established, in that Brandes in the first two of the book’s three sections places
                the main emphasis on the Early Romantic phase around 1800 and then concludes with
                the Restoration after 1815. He sees a certain revolutionary potential in Friedrich
                Schlegel’s novel about free love, <em>Lucinde</em> (1799), but he fundamentally
                understands Romanticism from its point of conclusion, in that he projects the
                conservative tendencies of Late Romanticism back onto the early Universal
                Romanticism, which is also rooted in his biographical approach to the literature.
                The same early work of Schlegel is negatively evaluated because it is viewed in
                light of his later conversion to Catholicism and his ultra-conservatism during the
                Restoration, after the Congress of Vienna. Romanticism <em>in toto</em> thus comes
                to be portrayed as politically reactionary.</p>
            <p>Brandes describes his particular method in the introduction as that of seeking the
                connection between biography and work. He designates “the anecdote” as his principle
                (Brandes 1873:4), understood as the illustrative microhistory, which is supplemented
                by Brandes’ topicalizing commentaries, which at certain points are expanded into
                programmatic declarations of a modern view of life. “Real life” is the object of
                investigation (Brandes 1873:5), his interests located in the psychology,
                palpitations of the soul and feelings (Brandes 1873:5-6) that form the basis of the
                literature. At the same time he stylizes his own role – in the spirit of Naturalism
                and Positivism – as that of the natural scientist and physician (Brandes 1873:6).
                This thus suggests a duality of the scientific and the vitalistic, understood as the
                non-material forces of life. This interest in the individual aspects results in
                certain fissures in Brandes’ negatively determined view of Romanticism: he is
                concerned with that which deviates from normality, with the transgression of
                boundaries, the mystical, the unexplainable and the ingenious. This ambivalence,
                between social political condemnation and psychological-aesthetic fascination is an
                important thread in <em>The Romantic School in Germany</em>.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>b. Brandes’ Cultural-Political Employment of German Romanticism</h2>
            <p> The timely nature of the political and literary criticism is clearly evident in
                Brandes’ comparison of German and Danish Romanticism in the introductory chapter.
                Even though the feudal, absolutist, and divided Germany of 1800 precluded political
                influence, the German authors created no less than a wholly original Romantic
                literature. The second-hand Romanticism of the Danes, on the contrary, was to a high
                degree built upon impulses from outside. Brandes surely enough refers to a “Nordic
                vein” (Brandes 1873:8), but mainly views Danish Romanticism as a German import. The
                German literature is a genuine expression of life and of life experience,
                demonstrating a “poetic-philosophical total vision of life” (Brandes 1873:11). The
                German authors have sophistication, experience and spirit, and are furthermore
                extreme, consequential and sickly, while the Danes, who have not themselves produced
                ideas, are on the contrary moderate, even-keeled, harmonious, healthy, and vigorous.
                These are not only characteristics of the personality, but also formal artistic
                traits, and the works of the Danish Romantics are said to be more rounded and more
                elegant than those of the Germans. </p>
            <p> Brandes here employs, in a gesture typical of his form of presentation, two
                metaphors that show that these fundamental difference cannot be valorized purely
                negatively or positively. On the one hand he deems German Romanticism to be a
                “hospital” full of “eccentric personalities,” while on the other he describes the
                Romantics as bold and daring mountaineers. The Danes are neither sick nor mad, yet
                consequentially lack the courage and desire for conquest: “we have left to others
                the scaling of Montblanc. We have avoided breaking our necks, but we have left
                standing the Alpine flowers, which only bloom atop the highest mountain peaks and at
                the edge of the precipice” (Brandes 1873:15). Thus he makes clear, in his image of
                the new extreme sport of the era, alpinism, that the literature in this book should
                be viewed as action, energy and the manifestation of life and not as a museum piece. </p>
            <p> In relation to Danish institutionalized literary history writing in the 19th
                century, Brandes departs from the three-phase model of Romanticism after 1800, which
                was held to constitute a new period of flourishing and of golden ages. This model is
                introduced by N.M. Petersen’s <em>Contribution to Danish Literary History</em>
                (1854-1861], and is consolidated in the decades after Brandes (Conrad 1996:305,
                311-19). Brandes does not to any worthwhile extent dwell on the idea that Nordic and
                popular Romanticism constitutes something especially valuable in Danish literature. </p>
            <p> But even though Brandes is frequently critical of the Danish Romantics in the course
                of his presentation, he should not be understood to be anti-national. On the
                contrary, he would gladly strengthen the national literature, inaugurating a new
                period of greatness under the sign of realism together with a new political future
                for Denmark, yet in so doing he dispenses with the Romantic Golden Age as an ideal.
                In contemporary German literary historical writing, for example in the prominent
                figure of Rudolf Haym, Romanticism is reevaluated in attunement to Germany’s
                political unification, and is read integrally with the Weimar Classicism of Goethe
                and Schiller as a part of the national canon (Hohendahl 1985:184). In Brandes these
                German texts collide to a certain extent with his employment of Arnold Ruge’s Young
                Hegelian, anti-Romantic cultural critique from the 1840s. </p>
            <p>These partially conflicting sources also manifest themselves in a contradictory image
                of Goethe and of German Neoclassicism in <em>The Romantic School in Germany</em>.
                The negative climax in the introduction is Brandes’ radical rhetoric of
                contamination: “Romanticism was poisoned by its sources” (Brandes 1873:21). The main
                sources of Danish Romanticism were those of Henrich Steffens and of his teacher
                F.W.J. Schelling, the philosophy of nature and of identity that Brandes identifies
                with opportunistic conservatism and a Christian life view. In later Danish literary
                history writing, the role of Steffens is otherwise regarded as positive, as the
                inspiration for Oehlenschläger and thereby for Danish Early Romanticism, the
                Universal Romanticism of 1800-7. For Brandes the freethinker, the orthodox
                Christianity (in both Lutheran and Catholic variants) and the orientation toward the
                past and the middle ages characteristic of Early Romanticism constitutes a point of

            <h2>c. Brandes’ Conception of Modernity</h2>
            <p>Brandes’ conception of modernity is complex. In a continuation of Left Hegelianism,
                he maintains a social-philosophical understanding of the modern as reason, freedom,
                emancipation, and progress, but at the same times operates with an
                aesthetic-literary modernity that is less unequivocal. The German critic Karl Heinz
                Bohrer has analyzed this tension between a social and an aesthetic conception of
                modernity, identifying it is as distinct thread in the German critique of
                Romanticism during the 19th century. Bohrer’s thesis is that the dominate Hegelian
                reception of Romanticism has effectively blockaded the new culturally critical and
                aesthetically radical concept of the modern that was indeed actually formulated by
                the Romantics in the form of a new understanding of subjectivity and new literary
                categories such as the “fantastic” and the “evil” (Bohrer 1999).</p>
            <p> This analysis can well be applied to Brandes’ critique, which on the surface
                condemns the Romantic experience of modernity and its literary expressions, yet at
                the same time captures it precisely. During the 1870s Brandes maintained an
                optimistic view of the liberal social-philosophical conception of modernity, yet
                soon found himself on the threshold of the artistic transitional phase toward the
                post-Naturalist currents in art and literature. It is typical to place in Danish
                literature a “breakthrough of the soul” around 1890, characterized by a new
                understanding of art and an interest in the subject and the psyche, which has
                affinities with the splintered and fragmented aesthetics of Romanticism. This
                literary and cultural-critical paradigm shift becomes evident in the reworking of
                    <em> The Romantic School in Germany</em>, and in its impact and reception
                history.</p>
            <p>Another tension in Brandes’ aesthetic conception of modernity is that on the one side
                he proposes an understanding of literature and art within a frame of a
                Realist-Naturalist conception of art and literature, while on the other he affirms
                an aesthetic ideal and conception of form that points back to Weimar Classicism and
                the time of Goethe. This is however not obvious in <em>The Romantic School in
                    Germany</em>, in so far as Brandes expends much energy in criticizing the
                Idealism dominate around in 1800 in Classicism as well as in Romanticism. This
                critique of Idealism shall be explained here.</p>
            <p>There are two constants in Hegel-influenced, 19th century literary history writing:
                the charge that the Romantics were overly subjective and the analysis of their lack
                of anchoring in reality (Bohrer 1999:142-; Ansel 2003:273-). These are both present
                in Brandes. Subjectivism, that is to say the philosophical doctrine that our
                knowledge of the world is conditioned by consciousness, is negatively associated
                with Romanticism by the Hegelians, and designated as arbitrariness, egomania,
                self-reflection, solipsism etc. J.G. Fichte’s radicalization of Kant’s theory of
                perception in his <em>Wissenschaftslehre</em> (1794-5) is viewed as the source of
                Romantic Subjectivism, and many Hegelian critics do not distinguish between Fichte’s
                doctrine of the I and Romantic poetry, especially with respect to Romantic irony
                (see below). In the same manner Brandes conceives of the Romantic period as “what is
                called Subjectivism and Idealism, the avoidance of historical external reality”
                (Brandes 1873:43), and like the Hegelians he identifies Fichte as the spokesperson
                of this tendency:</p>
            <blockquote>By the absolute I it was understood, by Fichte himself in a foundational yet
                varied manner, not the idea of divinity but the human, the thinking being, and the
                new desire for freedom, the self-willfulness and the self-satisfaction of the I,
                which with the arbitrariness of the absolute monarch allowed the external world to
                vanish in relation to the self. This intoxication with freedom comes to a head in a
                peculiarly arbitrary, ironic and fantastical band of young geniuses. (Brandes
                1873:43-4)</blockquote>
            <p> In looking closely at Brandes’ utterance, in the first part there is a suggestion of
                the acknowledgment of the revolt against the metaphysical as a constricting program
                of interpretation, but in the second part he turns 180 degrees toward a negative
                analogy between the perceiving subject and political absolutism. In the first
                edition Brandes identifies two early Romantic Künstlerromane, Ludvig Tieck’s <em>Die
                    Geschichte des Herrn William Lovell</em> (1795-6) and Jean Paul’s <em>Titan</em>
                (1800-3), as exemplary of Romantic Subjectivism and Idealism.</p>
            <p>Properly understood, these novels are not well disposed to serve as ammunition in the
                war between action and reaction, because both are more differentiated than
                appreciated and address directly the post-Kantian philosophy and Fichte’s Subjective
                Idealism. Brandes acknowledges Jean Paul, but does not entirely comprehend that
                precisely through his figure of Roquairol in <em>Titan</em> he demonstrates both the
                psychological possibilities and the risks of the autonomy of consciousness,
                including in varying degrees those of melancholy, self-destruction, the fragmenting
                of the self, and madness (Schulz 1983:356-7). On the contrary, Brandes sees the
                novel as a celebration of the Romantic illness of reflection and its lack of
                capacity to master reality (Brandes 1873:56-7). It is furthermore an historical
                distortion on the part of Brandes to designate the two works as “pioneers” of
                Romanticism; <em>Titan</em> was published only after Schlegel’s <em>Lucinde</em>,
                which for Brandes marks the beginning. In the second edition Brandes demonstrates
                greater attention to chronology by moving this analysis to later in the book, to a
                dedicated chapter on Jean Paul, yet the negative evaluation of him remains
                unchanged.</p>
            <p> Not only Fichte’s philosophy and literary Subjective Idealism, but also the
                Objective Idealism and the imitative Classicism of Goethe and Schiller are included
                in Brandes’ characterization of the “negative” pioneers of Romanticism. The two
                German poets flee from a society that has removed the possibility of citizen
                participation (Brandes 1873:29), and their retreat from reality leads to a
                polarization of literary life, between an elite poetry of cultivation and a
                literature of popular entertainment. Here Brandes reasons democratically and
                sociologically, from the idea that literature constitutes an important element of
                the new public around 1800.</p>
            <p>There is in Brandes a kind of double argumentation that is also typical of
                contemporary German criticism (Hohendahl 1995:129-31). On the one hand he subscribes
                to an understanding of literature as autonomous and set apart from societal
                interests and politics, although it can also however be a countervailing force
                against these factors, a role which had been adopted in seriousness by Romanticism.
                And on the other hand he holds that literature should possess a distinct function as
                a call to action and as a political document. This tension reveals itself in
                Brandes’ treatment of Goethe, who is described strikingly critically in the
                introduction (Rømhild 1996:46-7). Here Goethe, in his ideality and his formal
                interests, is accused of creating an abstract and de-individualized, ahistorical
                art. Brandes thus takes up the thread from the final part of <em>Emigrant
                    Literature</em>, where he describes German Romanticism as a natural counter
                reaction to the strictness and universality of Classicism. Brandes acknowledges
                Goethe’s passionate youthful poetry, especially the novel of <em>Werther</em>
                (1774), and otherwise praises only his idyllic epic of the revolutionary years,
                    <em>Hermann und Dorothea</em> (1797).</p>
            <p>In the second edition, however, the image of Goethe is far more positive, for he is
                described along with Herder and Lessing as part of a new cultural departure, in
                which the Sturm und Drang, Classical and Romantic periods are viewed in a dynamic
                interplay. But already in the unfolding of the first edition, Brandes’ image of
                Goethe had slowly changed, as across its pages he eventually reconciles with the
                German “poet prince.” He employs Goethe’s conceptions of form and of
                    <em>Bildung</em> as an antidote to the Romantics, especially how they reveal
                themselves in the novel of <em>Wilhelm Meister</em>. The main character Wilhelm
                manages to form his ideal in tune with experiences of the world (Brandes
                1873:252-3). Goethe’s conception of <em>Bildung</em> becomes the positive
                counterpart to that which Tieck, Wackenroder and especially Novalis exhibit in their
                    <em>Künstler</em>- and <em>Bildungsromane</em> (Brandes 1873:253-). According to
                Brandes, literature should on the one side be in contact with modern life and be
                realistic, while on the other it should poeticize this reality and impact in an
                edifying manner, that is to say form positive images of existence. Romantic art, in
                its interest in the past and the middle ages, its fractured expression “without
                fixed forms” (Brandes 1873:19), its Romantic irony, its hybrid genres, and its
                antiheroes, does not achieve this. Strictly speaking Wilhelm Meister is also an
                antihero, and Brandes must take up its continuation, <em>Wilhelm Meisters
                    Wanderjahre</em>, in which Wilhelm becomes a doctor, in order to legitimate
                Goethe on this point.</p>

            <h2>d. Brandes’ Concept of Form: Romantic Music and Painting</h2>
            <p>In his critical praxis Brandes works fundamentally with a view of art that reaches
                back to a classical and idealistic aesthetics of wholeness. Goethe’s harmonious
                conception of the work, which is tied to an image of the cultivated and autonomous
                individual (Sørensen 2017:79-80), is the implicit norm against which Romantic art is
                measured. It is therefore both the form and the content of Romanticism that is
                critiqued, and Brandes’ conception of aesthetics and form becomes especially evident
                in the two chapters on music and painting, chapters VII and VII (Brandes
                1873:126-84), in which he demarcates Romantic literature in relation to the
                non-linguistic art forms.</p>
            <p>Brandes’ ideal is the plastic description, and he himself employs a pictorial
                language that is sensual, concrete and comprehensible. By describing Romantic
                literature in relation to music and painting, Brande is able to isolate the various
                forms of representation. In its imitation of instrumental music Romantic literature
                loses its material reality and becomes “artistic moods” rather than “works of art”
                (Brandes 1873:136). </p>
            <p>Romantics like Schlegel and Novalis valorize the musical principal in their works,
                that is euphony and beauty, at the expense of meaning. Brandes reveals himself here
                to be an aesthete of content, yet ultimately demonstrates an understanding of form
                and of Tieck, who ventures “wholly outward into his madness” (Brandes 1873:144).
                Illustratively, Brandes thus imitates a Romantic text built upon the movements of a
                symphony with purely nonsense words devoid of acoustical meaning. He bemoans how
                Romantic literature lacks ‘tendency,’ that is an orientation toward life and action”
                (Brandes 1873:149), yet at the same time reveals a sharp sense for the poetics of
                sound and for language as ornament, as arabesque. In the chapter on the Romantics
                relation to art and to landscape, by citing Goethe’s writing on Winckelmann, Brandes
                criticizes the so-called Nazarene painters, who in opposition to the Classicist
                norms of the academy around 1800 cultivated an inward and pious Romantic-religious
                art. They took inspiration from medieval Italian and German painters, from
                contemporary Romantic theories of art, and especially from Tieck’s novel <em>Franz
                    Sternbalds Wanderungen</em>.</p>
            <p>But Brandes primarily employs the Nazarene phenomenon as a launching point for a
                critique of the later Catholicism of the Romantics and of the older Friedrich
                Schlegel’s interest in “lox, crayfish and wine” (Brandes 1873:167), as well as the
                Restoration politician Friedrich von Gentz’s passion for “furniture, perfume and the
                refinement of the so-called luxurious” (Brandes 1873:167). This section particularly
                demonstrates Brandes’ particular technique of representation. By going back and
                forth between Goethe’s Winckelmann book of 1805 and Friedrich Schlegel’s biography
                after the Congress of Vienna, Brandes manipulates the historical chronology and
                changes the causal context such that the decadent, the elitist and the reactionary
                is already witnessed in the point of departure of the young Romantics.</p>
            <p>Brandes asserts that the Romantic understanding of nature displaces the emotional in
                favor of the fantastic. The Romantics favor the solitude of the forest and the
                moonbeam nighttime, the superstitious, intuitive and mystical, but wholly lack
                mimetic description. Brandes thus criticizes the Romantic image of Italy for not
                representing the “real Italy with its powerful colors and lively movement” (Brandes
                1873:154), but on the contrary “Italy as ruins” and “Catholicism as a mummy”
                (Brandes 1873:154). Brandes here tests out the connection between actual geography
                and the literary space of engagement and between the authors’ place of residence and
                their literary production, thereby entering into the domain of literary geography.
                This is doubtless inspired by Taine’s theory of climate, race and milieu, yet
                ultimately Brandes can be viewed as a pioneer, in that literary geography as an
                independent genre of criticism is normally placed after 1900 (Piatti 2008:68-70),
                which is then taken up again later in the 20th century’s “spatial turn” in literary
                studies. Brandes’ approach is not systematic, but his prioritization of place and
                space over time is an important supplement to his historical-philosophical optics. </p>
            <p>Ludvig Tieck is especially in Brandes’ spotlight. Tieck’s childhood in sandy
                Brandenburg and the “cold and clear days of Berlin along with his modern north
                German rationalism” (Brandes 1873:170-1) is viewed as the reason that Tieck longs
                for nature yet does not manage to recreate an authentic nature in his works, instead
                portraying artificial landscapes that resemble stage scenery. Brandes puts his own
                nature program to the test in a travel account from Saxon Switzerland (southeast of
                Dresden in Saxony), filling many pages with realistic observations of nature. He
                contrasts his own report with an unnamed Romantic fellow traveler (which could have
                been H.C. Andersen but in the second edition is identified as M.A. Goldschmidt; see
                also Brandes 1907:106), which poetically transforms the landscape as it passed into
                night to a transcendent, ghost ridden, gothic space. Brandes thus blends the fictive
                and the essayistic into his literary criticism. This spatial-concrete strategy of
                description, which demonstrates the opposite of the Romantic principle of form, is
                also employed by Brandes in his analysis of the Romantic mentality.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>e. The German Romantic Mentality: Soul [Gemyt], Longing and Reflection</h2>
            <p>Brandes lays out the Romantic mentality in chapters IX, X and XI (Brandes
                1873:184-282), summarizing it as three dispositions: reflection, soul and longing.
                In each chapter he employs a chief literary example that, in combination with
                biography and cultural history, describes the peculiarly Romantic anthropology that
                leads toward the modern, Brandesian ideals of personality and art. There are certain
                recurrent traits in this part of the book: Brandes addresses the reader almost in
                the manner of the tour guide, and he concludes each chapter with his own manifesto
                for the modern human personality. He especially cites Arnold Ruge (Brandes
                1873:216,219), one of the severest critics of Romanticism, and employs throughout a
                vigorous pictorial language that critically mirrors the stylistic traits of the
                Romantics.</p>
            <p>Fruitfully, in the chapter on soul, Brandes zeroes in on the Romantic locus: the
                mountain and the mine (which in various forms connote mysticism, eroticism and
                transformation in for example E.T.A. Hoffmann, Joseph Eichendorff and later in
                Richard Wagner’s Venus Mountain), turning the pragmatic into a concrete locality of
                the German “soul.” Instead of imparting a spiritual dimension to the typical
                materials of the Romantic strategy of symbolization, he moves in the opposite
                direction, interpreting something abstract and psychological wholly materially and
                physically. The plane of the image becomes the plane of reality when Brandes
                challenges the reader to go down into the mountain hollow that is the Romantic mind.
                This is thereby made into an experiential discovery:</p>
            <blockquote> Have you ever gone down into a mine? Have you ever been led by a man with a
                lamp down into a subterranean shaft, and by the uncertain light of that lamp gazed
                around at the expanse? . . . The shaft I challenge you go down into with me is the
                German soul, a hollow as deep, as obscure, as extraordinary as any other. (Brandes
                1873:213-14) </blockquote>

            <p>“Soul” is a specifically German phenomenon that is fundamentally untranslatable,
                Brandes asserts. He places it between conviction and feeling: he traces a line from
                Goethe’s warmth of soul toward the extreme, overheated emotionalism of the
                Romantics, who bottle themselves up in their faith in the right of the “world of
                inwardness” (Brandes 1873:216,234). Yet whereas the French revolutionaries as well
                as Brandes understand the right of the world of inwardness as reason that shall be
                realized, the ideal for the world shy Romantics is equivalent to soul and thus
                becomes an internal phenomenon. This analogy, between French political revolution
                and the spiritual German Romantic revolution, is in Brandes thereby purely
                psychologized, which diminishes German philosophical Idealism.</p>
            <p>Not only a German-French antithesis, but also German-English antithesis is employed
                in a similar manner, by contrasting Novalis’ “inward looking life of soul” with
                Shelley’s “outward looking desire for freedom” (Brandes 1873:244). Novalis and two
                of his works are at the center of Brandes’ analysis of soul: first the cycle of
                poems <em>Hymnen an die Nacht</em> (1800), the six songs of which celebrate the
                night as a complementary, liberating and redeeming space in a synthesis of
                Christianity, classical mythology and the poet’s own mystical vision, and second the
                address <em>Die Christenheit oder Europa</em> (1799). The latter is an oft-discussed
                vision of Europe’s future after the French Revolution, because it valorizes the
                middle ages as a time of European unity that shall be recreated as a new golden age.
                This Romantic philosophy of history, with its three segments of past, present and
                future, should however be understand to be a fiction and a hypothesis. Both the
                poems and the speech entail a Romantic project of creating a “new mythology” that
                could provide a renewed sense of cohesion in a secularized and enlightened age.</p>
            <p>Brandes however understands this Early Romantic discourse as anachronistic and alien
                to reality. He does not at all accept the manner in which the works attempt to
                overstep genre by blending poem, prayer, sermon, vision, prophecy, and meditation.
                He reads them referentially and according to content, dismissing the valorization of
                the night and regarding the sensuality as lascivious illness (Brandes 1873:218) and
                the mysticism as orthodoxy (Brandes 1873:224), yet nevertheless cites long passages
                of the hymns in both Danish and German. Likewise, he reproduces long excerpts from
                    <em>Die Christenheit oder Europa</em>, from both the understanding of the past –
                not least Novalis’ negative view of the Reformation and Protestantism – and the
                vision of the future. The expansive citations flow into Brandes emphatic demand for
                “Air! Light!” (Brandes 1873:233) and for emancipation from the German claustrophobia
                of the mountain hollow of soul toward the political and social realities of the
                external world.</p>
            <p>Brandes introduces the chapter on Romantic reflection and psychology with the same
                performative zeal, inviting the reader into a mirror cabinet to experience the
                dizzying effect of seeing oneself infinitely reduplicated. The effect is likened to
                the manner in which Romantic irony punctures the illusion. Brandes identifies
                Holberg’s comedy <em>Ulysses on Ithaca</em> (1723) as a forerunner to Tieck’s drama
                    <em>Der gestiefelte Kater</em> (1797), which is speckled with Romantic irony in
                the form of the characters’ meta-commentaries on the action and in the enframed
                segments within segments, in which the characters in the one segment act as
                observers in the next. Brandes illustrates this textual complexity by comparing it
                to a series of Danish theatrical works from Holberg through Oehlenschläger to
                Heiberg, before concluding with Shakespeare: “will you imagine such confusion? Think
                of <em>Jeppe of the Hill</em> written in such a manner, such that “Jeppe” sits and
                watches <em>Hakon Jarl</em>, while <em>April Fools</em> is performed for Hakon and
                Thora, while <em>Hamlet</em> is played for Hans and Trine” (Brandes 1873:189).
                Brandes psychological method of argumentation is on display here. The idea that an
                individual can transcend his own temporality and thus experience several centuries,
                as in Novalis’ <em>Bildungsroman Heinrich von Ofterdingen</em>, is rejected by
                Brandes:</p>
            <blockquote>Romanticism thus diffuses the I, spreading it over space, just as it
                stretches the I over time. It respects neither space nor time. The being of
                self-consciousness is self- duplication. But this self is sick, in that it does not
                manage to master this duplication. (Brandes 1873:198)</blockquote>
            <p>Brandes briefly identifies doppelgangerism and self-duplication in Jean Paul,
                Heinrich Kleist and Achim von Arnim, but he dwells on it most in E.T.A. Hoffmann’s
                Late Romantic, fantastical horror novel <em>Die Elixiere des Teufels</em> (1815-16),
                which describes the monk Brother Medardus’ struggle against his doppelgangers. Here
                he draws on Danish literature, showing how the theme of the fracturing of the
                personality is an inspiration for B.S. Ingemann. The crowning example of Romantic
                ironic psychology is however identified as Kierkegaard, in his double communication
                and his pseudonymous authorship (see below).</p>
            <p>Finally there is the third category, Romantic “longing,” which Brandes defines as
                “lack and desire in unison without the will or the decisiveness to acquire that
                which is lacking and without the choice of means to bring it under one’s control”
                (Brandes 1873:247). This is illustrated by employing the central symbol of
                Romanticism, the blue flower that appears in Novalis’ novel. The blue flower does
                not manifest itself concretely, but is glimpsed, sensed, intuited. Brandes thus
                critically attacks a characteristic of Romantic Idealism, namely its accentuation of
                becoming and process over result. Whereas Goethe’s Wilhelm Meister, as noted, shifts
                his ideal as a result of his encounters with reality, Romantic heroes such as
                Heinrich von Ofterdingen, Franz Sternbald and William Lovell do the opposite, in
                that reality dissolves and “the world in the end becomes soul” (Brandes 1873:257).
                Brandes further discusses Joseph Eichendorff’s novel <em>Aus dem Leben eines
                    Taugenichts</em> (1826), which is compared to the heroes in H.C. Andersen’s
                    <em>The Improvisatore</em> (1835) and O.T. (1836). In this chapter the telescope
                is turned against the Danish Romantics’ variant of this world denying poetry of
                longing in especially Andersen and Ingemann, but also M.A. Goldschmidt, Poul Møller,
                Christian Winther, and J.C. Hostrup. </p>
            <p>Soul, longing and reflective fragmentation constitute the contrasting pole to
                Brandes’ own ideal of personality and art in the name of social and philosophical
                modernity. Yet he neither dismisses the psychological complexity nor defends a
                trivial and flat understanding of existence, but acknowledges the extreme state of
                dreaming, hallucination and madness (Brandes 1873:206-7) as well as loss, sorrow and
                pain (Brandes 1873:207). With reference to Taine he conceives of the personality as
                an association of ideas that creates cohesion between the experiences of the I and
                finally is held together by the identity, whose minimal definition is “the name”
                (Brandes 1873:207). The healthy personality must constantly assert itself against
                attacks from external conditions, just as with illness, and he summarizes his
                program in the well-known dictum of the trinity of freedom, will, and decision: “if
                man is multi-faceted and of necessity divided by nature, then he is made fully human
                through freedom, will, and decision” (Brandes 1873:213). In a similar manner,
                Brandes rejects the Romantic faith in pleasure and happiness through his
                Mill-inspired, utilitarian moral philosophy. Lack is an unavoidable fact of life
                (Brandes 1873:281), but pain and suffering can be alleviated. Brandes concludes this
                section with a challenge to emancipate the pent up and suppressed part of humanity
                from “ignorance, dependency, foolishness, and the chains of slavery” (Brandes
                1873:282). The task of the new man and the modern poet is not to long or to dream,
                but to act:</p>
            <blockquote>The child of the new age will not gaze up into the heavens in search of his
                stars, nor off into the horizon in search of the blue flower. Longing is idleness,
                but he wants to act. He wants to understand what Goethe meant when he had Wilhelm
                Meister end up as a doctor. There is nothing else: we must all become doctors, the
                poets too. (Brandes 1873:282)</blockquote>
            <p>This intellectual historical sketch, in its antithetical style and its translation of
                aesthetic-literary categories into psychological-mental, is of a pace with a broader
                cultural reception of Romanticism that would produce offshoots in the 20th century.
                The analysis of the Romantic as an especially German intellectual tradition bounded
                against those of France and England is later taken up by Thomas Mann (see Reception
                and Afterlife).</p>

            <h2>f. Brandes’ Conception of the Individual: Between Goethe and Kierkegaard</h2>
            <p>Brandes unfolds his conception of the individual in dialogue with Goethe and
                Kierkegaard (Rømhild 1996:48). Brandes engages with Kierkegaard regularly in the
                first three volumes of <em>Main Currents</em>, but in <em>The Romantic School in
                    Germany</em> this engagement with and discussion of him is intensified. Only a
                few years later, in 1877, Brandes would produce the first Kierkegaard biography,
                which marked the beginning of scholarly investigation of the Christian
                existentialist philosopher as both literary figure and theologian. As Finn Hauberg
                Mortensen argues, the biography can be seen as an examination of how Kierkegaard fit
                into Brandes’ Modern Breakthrough (Mortensen 1993:47). Furthermore, Kierkegaard
                appears in <em>The Romantic School in Germany</em> as both opponent and ally. He is
                cited liberally in the first three chapters on Romantic pioneers, in the material on
                Schlegel’s <em>Lucinde</em>, and in the chapter on Romantic reflection and
                psychology. Brandes discusses in part Kierkegaard’s treatise <em>On The Concept of
                    Irony</em> (1841) and his <em>Either-Or</em> (1843), especially “The Seducer’s
                Diary,” which he had read in 1860 during a religious crisis that concluded with his
                embrace of atheism (Fenger 1980:50-3).</p>
            <p>Kierkegaard’s <em>On the Concept of Irony</em> is an investigation of irony in three
                parts: first as concept and praxis in Socrates, next in German Romanticism and
                finally in Kierkegaard’s own doctrine of “controlled irony.” On the surface
                Kierkegaard adopts Hegel’s critique of the Romantics, similarly asserting that
                Fichte’s subjective philosophy sidelines the objective sphere, e.g. tradition,
                society and external, historical reality. Fichte’s doctrine in both Hegel and
                Kierkegaard is placed alongside Schlegel’s irony and is viewed as a destructive
                power (Stewart 2015), which Kierkegaard designates as “infinite, absolute
                negativity” (Kierkegaard 1997:309). </p>
            <p>Schlegel’s irony was a target of critique throughout 19th century, and thus it is
                necessary to briefly sketch his conception of it, which is more than a rhetorical
                figure or literary concept. It encapsulates his philosophy in the form of an “ironic
                idealism” (Oesterreich 1994:355-6) that is diametrically opposed to that of Hegel.
                Schlegel’s irony, which is developed on the basis of both Socrates and Fichte,
                emphasizes that thinking is a never completed process that occurs in the interplay
                between extremes. It is variously defined as, for example, an enthusiastic
                    “<em>Selbstschöpfung</em>” [self-creation] or as a skeptical
                    “<em>Selbstvernichtung</em>” [self-destruction] (Schlegel 2000:97), the terms
                revealing that irony is possessed of both artistic and existential implications and
                is closely bound up with Schlegel’s conception of <em>Bildung</em> (Zovko 2017:310).
                Whereas Hegel’s idealistic philosophy is teleological and operates with a final aim
                in sight, no endpoint can be fixed in Schlegel’s thinking. Kierkegaard reads
                Schlegel’s irony as leading to nihilism, positing in opposition “irony as the
                controlled moment” (Kierkegaard 1997:352-). This suggests a break with the Hegelian
                system (Oesterreich 1994:362), and thus in the course of Kierkegaard’s analysis of
                Schlegel he passes from critique toward positive reception, in that his reading of
                    <em>Lucinde</em>, in the words of Ernst Behler, becomes a singular “literary
                delirium” that anticipates the modern subjectivity of the aesthete in his later
                authorship, thereby nearly annulling the moral and ethical condemnation of Schlegel
                (Behler 2011:27: Bohrer 1999:69-72). Kierkegaard summarizes Schlegel’s doctrine as
                “living poetically” (Kierkegaard 1997:316) and “poeticizing the self” (Kierkegaard
                1997:318), yet on ethical grounds rejects the idea that an aesthetic mode of
                possibility can support a mode of reality.</p>
            <p>Brandes is fundamentally in agreement with Kierkegaard on his critique of irony,
                which he attacks throughout the book. Yet Brandes does not distinguish between
                Kierkegaard’s early treatise on irony and “The Seducer’s Diary” in
                    <em>Either-Or</em> (1843). It is difficult to extract a positive or unequivocal
                result from this text on <em>Bildung</em> and eroticism, which in its complex form
                and narrative structure consists of a publisher and several narrators, yet Brandes
                places an equivalence between the whole text and Johannes the Seducer and between it
                and Schlegel’s <em>Lucinde</em>. Both works are for Brandes examples of the
                Subjectivism of Romantic irony:</p>
            <blockquote>At the deepest level of <em>Lucinde</em> lays the Subjectivism, the
                self-willfulness that as arbitrariness can become all that is possible, revolution,
                audacity, dogmatism, reaction, because from the very first it is not bound to any
                power, since the I does not work in the service of the only idea that provides a
                striving with foundation and worthiness: that of progress and freedom. (Brandes
                1873:74).</blockquote>
            <p>Brandes cannot come to terms with the dangerous and indeterminate space of
                communication that irony opens. For Brandes Kierkegaard’s subjectivity, which
                expresses itself in paradoxes and asserts a “freedom from prejudices,” opens itself
                at the same time itself to these same things (Brandes 1873:75-6). Johannes the
                Seducer thus constitutes the completion of Romantic irony and its conclusion in
                Danish literature (Brandes 1873:49), and its only reconciliatory component is that
                it is held in check by the ethical in the novel’s “schema” (Brandes 1873:49).
                Brandes’ employment of Kierkegaard is dubious, in that through lengthy citations he
                in part affirms Kierkegaard’s cultural critical characterization of the bourgeoisie,
                conventions and quotidian morality of the Romantic era (Brandes 1873:68-9,81), and
                in part rejects Kierkegaard’s Christian understanding of Schlegel’s <em>Lucinde</em>
                (Brandes 1873:73). This same duality characterizes his Kierkegaard biography, in
                which he identifies with Kierkegaard’s polemic against society, passionate
                combativeness and his feud with the national church of his final years, yet
                criticizes him for remaining within the strictures of religious thought, with which
                Brandes had previously broken (Mortensen 1993:51).</p>
            <p>Another liberation Brandes acknowledges in Kierkegaard is the emancipation of
                language from tradition and systems of genre, the establishment of a new
                literary-philosophical discourse (Lundtofte 2003:210). Kierkegaard’s fluid pictorial
                style constitutes a wholly foundational inspiration for Brandes, which he himself
                adopts in the biography, which can be viewed as the adoption of the Romantic
                anti-mimetic aesthetic he otherwise opposes (Mortensen 1993:50; Lundtofte
                2003:210).</p>
            <p>In <em>The Romantic School in Germany</em> Brandes asserts an understanding of
                individuality grounded in both his social-philosophical conception of modernity and
                in Goethe’s concept of <em>Bildung</em>. He demands a concentrated personality of
                “unity, will and freedom,” but also accepts an openness in the form of idealistic
                striving and a processual synthesis between the individual and surroundings as in
                Wilhelm Meister. Kierkegaard’s radical subjectivity and his concept of “that single
                individual” presents a third model, which in its modern expression is of a pace with
                Romanticism and points forward to later aesthetic modernism as it was introduced in
                Symbolism. This modern conception of the individual, marked by loss of identity,
                fragmentation and conflict oversteps Brandes horizon of understanding in <em>The
                    Romantic School in Germany</em>; Annemette Lundtofte illuminates the paradox
                that Brandes chooses Kierkegaard, who challenges the idea of a cohesive identity, as
                the object of his first biography (Lundtofte 2003:190-). Brandes scholars normally
                date the change in his understanding of the individual to his “aristocratic radical”
                phase characteristic of his later authorship, which was closely connected to his
                discovery of Nietzsche at the end of the 1880s (Mortensen 1993:52), yet it is
                already foregrounded here in his struggle against Romanticism. </p>
            <p>Brandes rejects the Kierkegaardian and Romantic conceptions of the individual
                subject, but is sympathetic to the social project that it is found in Schlegel’s
                only novel and especially in the women of Romanticism.</p>

            <h2>g. Schlegel’s Lucinde, Love, Women and Gender</h2>
            <p>In the chapter “Romanticism’s Social Experiment” Brandes addresses the themes of
                marriage, eroticism, women, and gender. Equality was an important point in Brandes’
                emancipatory program, and <em>The Romantic School in Germany</em> appears between
                his translation of Stuart Mill’s <em>On the Subjection of Women</em> in 1869 and the
                “Nordic War over Sexual Morality” that played out in the 1880s. At the center of the
                chapter is both the Romantic conception of love as found in Friedrich Schlegel’s
                novel <em>Lucinde. Bekenntnisse eines Ungeschickten</em> (1799) and the Romantic
                praxis of life with special focus on the biographies of the women authors.</p>
            <p> Freidrich Schlegel’s novel awakened great offense, specifically its suggestion that
                marriage should be grounded in passion. The idea that both man and woman should be
                active parts in a spiritual and physical love relationship was met with immense
                moral condemnation by his contemporaries. In addition to its status as a scandalous
                novel was the fact that it was read biographically, as a portrait of Friedrich
                Schlegel’s out of wedlock relationship with Dorothea Veit and against the background
                of her divorce from her husband, and yet it was not just the content, but also its
                experimental form that earned it condemnation. Nineteenth century criticism of
                    <em>Lucinde</em> is marked by its skepticism, apart from the favorable
                contemporary reception of Friedrich Schleiermacher, who write a continuation of the
                story in his 1800 <em>Vertraute Briefe über die Lucinde</em> (which was reissued
                with an enthusiastic afterword by the Young Germany poet Karl Gutzkow in 1835). In
                the early 20th century the novel was positively reevaluated, and in the 1960s, in
                connection with the historical and critical edition of Friedrich Schegel’s works (v.
                Behler and Eichner), a rising tide of interest in <em>Lucinde</em> was evidenced in
                German literary studies (Polheim 1999:213-15). </p>
            <p> Brandes is located between the Young Germany movement’s celebration of
                    <em>Lucinde</em> as an erotic manifesto and the critical reservations of
                contemporary German literary historians. Yet he reads Schlegel in his own manner, in
                a dialogue with both Schleiermacher’s early appraisal and Kierkegaard’s later views
                in <em>On the Concept of Irony</em>. There are thus three layers of reception and
                three horizons of understanding that Brandes attempts to weave together. Brandes is
                sympathetic to Schlegel’s project, but critical of its execution. He affirms the
                revolt against the bourgeois conception of rational and compulsory marriage, yet
                criticizes the novel’s presentation and language. It is “pale and doctrinaire”
                (Brandes 1873:72), artistically impotent, filled with “false starts” and “feeble
                self-worship” (Brandes 1873:74). Brandes physical and corporeal pictorial language
                and his suggestion of impotence negatively reflects the erotic theme, yet he does
                not deliver a substantial analysis of form. The novel is a heterogeneous collection
                of textual parts in various genres such as letters, diary entries, dialogue, and
                aphorisms. Today this is viewed as Schlegel’s ambitious attempt to realize his
                philosophical program for a Universal Romantic poetry of modernity in a new Romantic
                novel, which also contains its own theory and reflects on its own construction.</p>
            <p>Brandes does not however address Schlegel’s fragments, <em>Über das Studium der
                    griechischen Poesie</em>, <em>Athenäeum</em> (1797) and <em>Lyceum</em> (1798),
                just as he does not, because of his Hegel-influenced philosophy of history, have a
                sense for how Schlegel emphasizes the processual as both means and end. Although
                Schlegel shares the faith in the ideality of art with Weimar Classicism, his concept
                of form is in contrast open and disharmonious. Since art should point forward to a
                still not yet realized ideal, which could be called his utopian dimension (Dehrmann
                2017:172), its form becomes complex and fragmentary. Kierkegaard had a greater
                understanding of this than Hegel and Brandes, yet as is apparent Brandes was blind
                to this connection. He does not continue the discussion taken up by both
                Schopenhauer and Kierkegaard, that of the relation between the aesthetic and the
                ethical, e.g. whether <em>Lucinde’s</em> hypothetical model of reality can be
                employed to life (Dierkes 1983:432). Brandes rejects the philosophy of life of the
                protagonists Julius and Lucinde and thereby “the Romantic doctrine of identity as
                life and poetry” (Brandes 1873:73), but he addresses only quite selectively the
                middle section of the novel “Lehrjahre der Männlichkeit.” This section resembles an
                epically narrated novel and describes Julius’ process of Bildung from being a
                libertine to finding true love in Lucinde and becoming a father. Brandes does little
                to document his analysis, only citing single sentences of Julius and Lucinde, which
                are employed as a launching point of a critique of the regressive Romantic
                historical vision and the Romantic philosophy of life summarized as “barrenness,
                arbitrariness, pleasure! . . . and purposelessness (Brandes 1873:79). Yet he also
                defends Schlegel by way of Kierkegaard, who is drawn in as a critic of the social
                conditions that have rendered love “as tame, as well-trained, as shambling, as
                lethargic, and as utilitarian as any domestic animal, in short, as unerotic as
                possible” (Brandes 1873:80).</p>
            <p>Brandes is in agreement in opposing an old-fashioned conception of womanhood, gender
                and love, yet he is not content with <em>Lucinde’s</em> failure to work out “any
                social result” (Brandes 1873:83). Whereas Schleiermacher and Kierkegaard both as
                theologians and philosophers (and Schleiermacher as clergyman) were anchored in a
                fundamentally ethical and religious, specifically Lutheran, vision of existence, and
                in their readings of Schlegel proceed to a defense, albeit with quite distinct
                implications, of the bourgeois institution of marriage (Dierkes 1983:434, 442-3),
                Brandes maintains his social critique, positing George Sand and Shelley as opposing
                figures to Schleiermacher. Thus he expands the spectrum of the Romantic discourse on
                love to France and England. In contrast to Schleiermacher’s idealization of love as
                a “<em>Bildung</em> force,” George Sand, according to Brandes, sees it as force of
                nature and as a strong yet mercurial passion that does not correspond to the fantasy
                of “the one true love.” She would therefore dissolve marriage as an institution
                (Brandes 1873:119-20). Brandes finds the same program in his hero of freedom
                Shelley, who would emancipate erotic love from compulsion and ways of life from
                religion and empty morality (Brandes 1873:121-4).</p>
            <p>This section of <em>The Romantic School in Germany</em>, the treatment of
                    <em>Lucinde</em> and the comparative analysis of love, anticipates the Nordic
                war over the sexual double standard and equality. In opposition to Bjørnstjerne
                Bjørnson’s call for chastity and restraint, which applied both to women as well as
                men and both before and during marriage, Brandes’ camp advocated for “free love.”
                Even though the feud also involved the new political women’s movement, the Nordic
                war over sexual morality should be viewed, as Annegret Heitmann has critically
                discerned, as primarily a men’s debate that reflects the insecurity born of
                maintaining privileges in a time of change (Heitmann 2006:204). A disruption of the
                male dominance of literature can be witnessed by the numbers: in the years between
                1870 and 1890, 70 Danish and 148 Swedish women made their debuts as authors
                (Heitmann 2006:203). </p>
            <p>In this section Brandes is especially interested in the woman as cultural
                personalities, portraying Dorothea Mendelssohn-Veit-Schlegel (married to Friedrich
                Schlegel) and Caroline Böhmer-Schlegel-Schelling (married to A.W. Schlegel and later
                to F.W.J. Schelling). The series of last names shows the women’s maiden and then
                married names, and it had long been a convention in German literary history to refer
                to female authors by their first names. Both women were active as translators and
                reviewers and as editors and secretaries of their author husbands, as it was
                difficult at the time to publish as a woman. The publication of their collected
                letters later in the 19th century led to the beginning of a new literary historical
                interest in female authorships. Brandes cites liberally from these letters and can
                be viewed as a pioneer in the discovery of these women, even though he adopts
                certain characterizations of their personalities from Rudolf Haym (Haym 1870/1961:
                663-). Dorothea Schlegel is one of the few who writes and publishes a novel,
                    <em>Florentin</em> (1801), although Friedrich Schlegel is listed as publisher.
                Brandes is not fond of the novel, yet asserts that it demonstrates greater poetic
                talent than Friedrich Schlegel (Brandes 1873:94). He empathizes with her plight and
                presents her as an example of how the women were “manlier and possessed more
                undivided power” (Brandes 1873:95) than the men and how they were also engaged with
                social conditions: “they feel more deeply the oppressiveness of the conditions, they
                are less weakened by bookish over refinement, and they have more practical sense and
                vision then the men around them” (Brandes 1873:95-6). The women’s critique of Fichte
                especially demonstrates much clear visions than that of the men, he argues (Brandes
                1873:96-7,104). Brandes illuminates Caroline Schlegel-Schelling’s role as
                inspiration for the whole of the Romantic circle with citations from A.W. Schlegel
                and Schelling and references from her anonymous review of the former’s drama
                    <em>Ion</em>. He dwells especially on her dramatic biography, particularly her
                sojourn with the Jacobin Georg Foster in Republican Mainz during 1792-3, which upon
                recapture by German troops resulted in her imprisonment. He is fascinated by the
                freethinking that marked the Romantic milieu, with its ever-shifting romantic
                couplings and mutual acceptance of new marriage alliances, and yet despite this
                “complete spiritual freedom from social bonds” (Brandes 1873:109), he pronounces a
                harsh judgment on the men, whose women were superior to them and whom they had
                destroyed: they “have dragged them down, have denied them their full attention and
                their most tender sympathies, providing only bits and scraps instead” (Brandes
                1873:111-12).</p>
            <p>Brandes’ feminism can be characterized by contrasting it with that of Friedrich
                Schlegel. <em>Lucinde</em> – despite its utopia of free and equal love – tends
                toward essentializing the feminine as the natural, spontaneous, emotional in
                contrast to masculine rationality, reflection and understanding. Brandes does not
                dispense with this gender binary, but transfers the masculine positive qualities
                over to the women. Through long citations he provides for women a voice, making them
                active discussion partners in his literary history. In this sense Brandes is ahead
                of Germany literary history writing, which only in the final two decades of the 19th
                century, commensurate with Germany’s first women’s movement, began to address the
                women of Romanticism (Becker-Cantarino 2000:262). Yet the liberal Vormärz writers
                had treated Rahel Varnhagen and Bettina von Arnim as iconic poetesses of freedom
                (Becker-Cantarino 2000:262-3), and while Brandes discusses the former with
                enthusiasm (Brandes 1873:90), he does not mention the latter (who is however treated
                in the volume <em>Young Germany</em> of 1890).</p>
            <p> This gender-determined optics changed in the 20th century, as real scholarship on
                female Romantic authors began. Yet the female authorships are typically not included
                in the Romantic canon, instead forming a separate canonical body, and they are
                continuously under-represented in accounts of German Romanticism (Becker-Camarino
                2000:260-1). In Danish literary history Lise Busk-Jensen’s vital work is the first
                account of Danish women authors in European Romanticism it is only with the vital
                work of Lise Busk-Jensen that an account of women authors is included in Danish and
                European Romanticism (Busk-Jensen 2009).</p>

            <h2>h. Romantic Politics</h2>
            <p>In the final section on Romantic politics, which includes an inset chapter on the
                drama, Brandes addresses the national phase of Romanticism after 1806. In the second
                edition the two nearly identically titled chapters are combined into one reduced and
                rewritten chapter. In both editions Brandes adopts Arnold Ruge’s negative view of
                Romanticism as anti-Enlightenment and anti-Humanist (Brandes 1873:344). Brandes
                employs the “fateful year of 1806,” in which Napoleon defeated Prussia and dissolved
                the Holy Roman Empire, as the point of departure for his analysis of German national
                culture, which is a consequence of the antagonistic Franco-German relations. He goes
                through the German national ideologues Fichte, Arndt and Körner, but also mentions
                the liberal reforms of Prussian society instituted by Stein and Hardenberg. Brandes
                remains critical in principle of the so-called Wars of Liberation in 1813, in that
                while Germany is no longer occupied by the French archenemy, that enemy had however
                represented the Revolution of 1789.</p>
            <p>Brandes asks what freedoms were in fact brought about by the wars. They only paved
                the way for a new system of oppression: “they had fought against the revolutionary
                tyranny on behalf of the reactionary principalities” (Brandes 1873:291). Brandes,
                perhaps inspired by Ernest Renan, sees clearly that national ideologies and the
                national cultural interest in language, history, folklore and fatherland emerge
                against the image of the enemy, and that German national character is cultivated in
                opposition to France. At the same time he himself engages in cultural stereotyping
                by contrasting French frivolity and freethinking with German morality and
                Christianity: “since the religion of the enemy had been humanity, the human spirit
                in its clarity and freedom, the national religion [of Germany] became Christendom,
                the Christian spirit in its obscurity and compulsion” (Brandes 1873:294). In this
                volume Brandes reduces National Romanticism to a feudally oriented “knightly
                Romanticism” represented by the German writer Friedrich Fouqué and the Dane B.S.
                Ingemann, whose trivial literary characteristics Brandes satirizes as “the
                psychology of the nobility or of horses, which in any case come off as one and the
                same” (Brandes 1873:306). In the second edition Brandes exhibits a greater openness
                to the national and folkloric stream in Romanticism, for example by identifying
                Richard Wagner as a part of the revitalization of the middle ages and by writing
                favorably in the new chapter on Arnim and Brentano of their collection of folk
                ballads in <em>Des Knaben Wunderhorn</em> (1806).</p>
            <p> That the chapter on Romantic drama in the first edition constitutes an interlude
                between the political sections can surely enough be attributed to Brandes’ Hegelian
                understanding of the dramatic genre as the synthesis of epic and lyric and as an
                expression of freedom and of spirit (Brandes 1873:308). Brandes employs Heinrich von
                Kleist and Zacharias Werner as examples, and is especially preoccupied with the
                former. The difficulty of placing dramatists and poets between Classicism and
                Romanticism is a result of the literary historical canon of the late 19th century,
                and is defined both negatively and positively by Brandes. Kleist’s formal abilities
                and character portraits are unlike the Romantics not “spongy” or “blurred,” yet “are
                penetrated by the Romantic-poetic madness” (Brandes 1873:312). Kleist exhibits
                Romantic individuality in radical form, in that he sends “his probes deep into the
                points of illness, where the intellect loses its mastery over itself: somnambulism,
                animal ecstasy, distraction, cowardice in the face of death” (Brandes 1873:312). Yet
                at the same time the pathological fascinates Brandes. He goes through all the dramas
                and some of the short stories, most substantially <em>Das Käthchen von
                    Heilbronn</em> (1810), in which passion is presented in a compound “that
                indiscriminately contains much that is laughable, offensive and sublime” (Brandes
                1873:314). And he rounds this out with a sympathetic portrayal of Kleist’s malaise
                and the circumstances of his suicide together with Henriette Vogel.</p>
            <p> Brandes chooses to illustrate “Romantic politics” with individual histories, namely
                in the form of a biography of the German-Austrian writer and politician Friedrich
                von Gentz (1764-1832), who had also later served as a theme for prominent historians
                and philosophers such as Golo Mann and Hannah Arendt. As a foundation Brandes cites
                a total of three sources: Karl Mendelssohn-Bartholdy’s biography of Gentz, his
                correspondence with Adam Müller and two volumes of his posthumous papers. To the
                Young Hegelians, Gentz, because of his extravagant life and his impact – as
                Metternich’s close adviser, First Secretary of the Congress of Vienna, and coauthor
                of the repressive Karlsbad Decrees of 1819, which had limited rights in the German
                states – was the very incarnation of the restorationist regime (Bohrer 1989:188,
                213-). Gentz translated Edmund Burke’s <em>Reflections on the Revolution in
                    France</em> (1790) to German in 1795, which would exert a strong influence on
                the skeptical reception of the German Romantics to the Revolution. Brandes does not
                however discuss this, even though he is as comparative critic and literary mediator
                cognizant of the intellectual significance of the translation. </p>
            <p>In portraying the life of Gentz, Brandes manages to encompass three important phases
                in Romantic political thought: the reaction to the French Revolution and its after
                effects (in Early Romanticism), the national mobilization during the Napoleonic wars
                and the occupation of German territory (in National Romanticism) and finally the
                circumstances of the Restoration after 1815 (in Late Romanticism). One must
                distinguish the three phases from one another as well as between Romantic political
                thought and actual political engagement.</p>
            <p> Later scholarship on Romanticism has investigated the contemporary implications of,
                for example, the German Romantics’ interest in the concepts of republicanism, peace
                and freedom, which were discussed in both fictive and non-fictive texts such as
                letters, treatises and essays. It is difficult to maintain a sharp distinction
                between conservative and liberal positions among the Romantics of the Restoration
                period (Schwering 1994:494-5), so the image is much more diffuse than that which
                Brandes portrays. In looking more closely at the actual political action of the
                Romantics, it must be taken into account that Friedrich Schlegel’s appointment as
                Austrian counsellor to Prince Metternich lasted only three years (1815-18), because
                his ultraconservative papal vision of recreating a Catholic empire was out of step
                with the politics of the allied powers (Schwering 1994:480-1). On the contrary, Adam
                Müller and Franz Baader alongside Gentz can be counted among active Romantic
                politicians of the Restoration, and through Gentz as the chief representative of the
                political dimension of Romanticism, Brandes is able to portray its anti-French,
                reactionary and monarchical threads without problems.</p>
            <p> Brandes conludes this chapter and thereby the volume by illuminating the merger and
                climax of German and French reaction in Joseph de Maistre, in order to be able to
                proclaim his critique of the contemporary reaction in Denmark and also the
                transition to the theme of the third volume of <em>Main Currents</em>, <em>The
                    Reaction in France</em>. In the second edition this last chapter is rewritten.
                The French ultraconservative thinker is left out, and in his place Brandes provides
                as a conclusion an overview of the three main groups of European Romantics: the
                French-German-English, the Scandinavian, and finally the Slavic.</p>

                <h2>a. Om udgaverne</h2>
                <p>The first edition of <em>The Romantic School in Germany</em> came out in 1873 in
                    both Denmark and Germany. In 1887 Brandes published a revised edition in
                    Germany, which became the basis for the Danish second edition of 1891. The
                    history of its reception and impact thus has a number of phases, stretching over
                    three decades through the epochal shift from the Modern Breakthrough to the
                    fin-de-siécle. Jens Bjerring Hansen has diligently described the complex
                    historical process of publication and republication and analyzed the context, in
                    part with respect to Brandes’ own development and changing conception of
                    Romanticism and in part with respect to the sociological, market and publication
                    rights circumstances (Bjerring-Hansen 2008), which is briefly summarized
                    here.</p>
                <p>An important reason that Brandes rewrote <em>The Romantic School in Germany</em>
                    is the nature of the German book market. When after the first edition he
                    switched to a new publisher, Veit &amp; Co. of Leipzig, the rights to <em>Main
                        Currents</em> were not secured, instead passing to a competitor, Barsdorf,
                    also based in Leipzig. Barsdorf capitalized on Brandes’ rising popularity,
                    issuing the first edition in three printings, which dominated the market, even
                    after Brandes published the second edition in 1887. Brandes failed to claim his
                    publication rights in a court case at the time (Bjerring-Hansen 2008:158-61).
                    This is the reason that the first edition of <em>The Romantic School in
                        Germany</em> is most prominent in the German reception, whereas in Denmark
                    it is the second edition of 1891, which is also included in Brandes’
                        <em>Collected Writings</em> and in Jespersen &amp; Pio’s 1960s edition of
                        <em>Main Currents</em>.</p>

                <h2>b. Danish and Scandinavian Reception</h2>
                <p> Man kan knap nok tale om en egentlig modtagelse af det trykte bind af <em>Den
                        romantiske Skole i Tydskland</em> i 1873. Ingen store københavnske dagblade
                    anmelder bogen, og Jørgen Knudsen skriver, med et citat af Brandes’ egen
                    opfattelse, at man ville tie ham ihjel (Knudsen 1985:308). De få avisomtaler
                    påpeger forskellen på første binds debatudløsende effekt og fraværet af omtale
                    nu, som vil de besegle, at Brandes er et overstået kapitel på den danske
                    kulturelle scene. Desuden vidner de om et polariset klima: I den
                    Højre-tilknyttede avis <em>Dags-Telegraphen</em> polemiserer den unavngivne
                    anmelder over Brandes’ debatstil, der gør hans ”fri tanke” til en doktrin. En
                    for tiden typisk konservativ retorik om den lurende socialistiske og
                    kommunistiske fare ses i de advarende ord, at den radikale fritænkning - hvis
                    omsat til praksis - ville være ensbetydende med ”Revolution, Socialisme og
                    Atheisme, Samfundsopløsning og Gudsfornegtelse” (usign.,
                        <em>Dags-Telegraphen</em> 17.11.1873, nr. 311, s. 7). </p>
                <p><em>Jyllandsposten</em> vender Brandes’ romantik-kritik mod ham selv og ”Nutidens
                    Fremskridts- og Frihedsmænd”, der på samme vis som romantikken vil nedrive
                    samfundets institutioner såsom ægteskabet ved at forsvare den fri kærlighed.
                    Brandes anklages for at være fremmed over for kristendommen og fædrelandet; han
                    forstår ikke ”dansk Aand, danske Følelser, dansk Tankeliv”
                        (<em>Jyllandsposten</em> 3.10.1873). </p>
                <p><em>Lolland-Falsters Stifts-Tidende</em> (29.7.1873) anholder derimod pressens
                    hårde behandling af Brandes, men ud fra det synspunkt, at det kan risikere at
                    ende i et martyrium, der vil gavne hans sag. Danmark skal ikke bortstøde
                    Brandes, ligesom nordmændene har gjort med Henrik Ibsen, og en ”hensynsløs
                    Behandlingsmaade” vil blot skaffe Brandes en alt for stor hjemlig indflydelse. </p>
                <p><em>Fyns Stiftstidende</em> (18.12.1873) forsvarer derimod romantikken mod
                    Brandes og dadler hans manglende anerkendelse af Oehlenschläger og Steffens samt
                    hans selektive beskrivelse af Tieck. Det er den eneste ansats til en faglig
                    kritik af Brandes og viser et vist førstehåndskendskab til og levende erindring
                    om den tyske romantik; ligeledes nævner <em>Dagens Nyheder</em> i sin positive
                    anmeldelse, som ellers kun består af citater fra <em>Den romantiske Skole</em>,
                    ”det just i disse Dage feirede Tieck-Jubilæum”, dvs. 100-året for digterens
                    fødsel (<em>Dagens Nyheder</em> 6.7.1873, nr. 177). </p>
                <p>Først i 1876 i det nye Venstre-hovedorgan <em>Morgenbladet</em>, som fra 1874
                    havde Viggo Hørup og lidt efter Edvard Brandes ansat, anmeldes de første fire
                    bind af <em>Hovedstrømninger</em> positivt i en føljeton over tre dage.
                    Anledningen er den fornyede diskussion om det æstetiske professorat ved
                    Københavns Universitet, og anmeldelsen er et partsindlæg, der indleder med at
                    påvise Brandes’ videnskabelighed. <em>Den romantiske Skole</em> refereres
                    udførligt over flere sider, hvor man dog ikke kan skelne den anonyme anmelders
                    ord fra Brandes’ egne (<em>Morgenbladet</em> 12.2.1876). </p>
                <p>I de skandinaviske aviser og tidsskrifter er anmeldelserne længere og grundigere.
                    De forklarer de svenske og norske læsere om Brandes’ forelæsninger, hans moderne
                    ide-program og kredsen omkring det. Det danske debatmiljø fremhæves som
                    anderledes livligt end søsterlandenes; i Danmark kan en bog ”ligesaafuldt” være
                    en ”Begivenhed, som et politisk Slag” (<em>Aftenbladet</em>, Kristiania,
                    3.1.1874), skriver den norske forfatter Kristian Elster. De tager Brandes
                    alvorligt som litteraturhistoriker, forholder sig undersøgende til hans metode
                    og argumentation og forsvarer, trods sympati for Brandes, romantikken mod en for
                    ensidig og historisk unuanceret udlægning. Den nævnte Elster hævder imod
                    nyttebevidstheden en idealistisk kunstforståelse og fremfører, at Brandes’
                    nyrationalisme med sin negation af ”det dybeste og skjønneste i Menneskenaturen”
                        (<em>Aftenbladet</em>, Kristiania, 3.1.1874) uvægerligt vil slå over i
                    reaktion. Han protesterer mod Brandes’ intolerance over for kristendommen
                    ligesom også Karl Warburg, der anfører, at denne gør ham blind over for
                    Grundtvig, og at han overser folkehøjskolens positive betydning (<em>Göteborg
                        Handels- og Sjöfarts Tidning</em>, 22.8.1873). </p>
                <p>Hvor Warburg sammenligner med Hermann Hettners litteraturhistorie og finder denne
                    mere afvejet end Brandes’, synes anmelderen i <em>Sydsvenska Dagbladet</em>
                    (5.9.1873), at Brandes overgår Heinrich Heine i vid og satire. En grundig
                    akademisk kritik giver C.R. Nyblom i <em>Svensk Tidskrift för Literatur, Politik
                        och Ekonomi</em> (Stockholm 1873, s. 401-422), hvor han eksempelvis afviser
                    Brandes’ sammenblanding af psykologi og refleksion og kritisk påviser
                    patriarkalske formuleringer i omtalen af de romantiske kvinder. Den svenske
                    litterat Arvid Ahnfelt, kendt for sin biografi over den svenske romantiker Carl
                    Jonas Love Almqvist, er i <em>Aftonbladet</em> (3.7.1873) begejstret over, at
                    Brandes læser den tyske romantik via Kierkegaard, der har en række fællestræk
                    med Almqvist. Paul Pry (pseudonym for Richard Kaufmann) omtaler i sit ”Bref från
                    Köpenhamn” (<em>Göteborg-Posten</em> 25.6.1873) både Brandes’ bog og hans tyske
                    oversætter Adolf Strodtmanns i samme år på tysk udkomne <em>Das geistige Leben
                        in Dänemark</em>, der tegner et meget negativt billede af en stagnation i
                    dansk kulturliv. Omstændighederne omkring denne bog kan ikke beskrives her, men
                    det kan kort bemærkes, at Brandes selv kan anses for at være medforfatter til
                    den, idet han bidrog med hele afsnit under tilblivelsen, da han i 1872 boede hos
                    ægteparret Strodtmann i Steglitz uden for Berlin (Knudsen 1985:310-313). </p>
                <p>Nogle år senere, i 1877, kom der i anledning af Brandes’ foredrag om Kierkegaard
                    i Norge en længere anmeldelse af de første fire bind af
                        <em>Hovedstrømninger</em> sammen med hans Kierkegaard-bog i <em>Norsk
                        Tidsskrift for Literatur</em>. Den er meget kritisk over for Brandes’
                    litteratursyn og særligt hans nord-syd-dualisme med afsmag for ”den germaniske
                    Kakkelovnsvarme og det germaniske Gemyt” og præference for ”Sydens legende
                    Solglans og livligt udadvendte Liv” (<em>Norsk Tidsskrift for Literatur</em>,
                    29.7.1877). Det er bemærkelsesværdigt, at anmelderen laver en modsat
                    valorisering af den nordeuropæiske åndshistorie og ser det ”germansknordiske”
                    som sammenhørende med England, Amerika og Norden som oprindelsessted for de
                    liberale frihedsidealer. </p>

                <h2>c. Den engelske og tyske modtagelse</h2>
                <p> I den britiske offentlighed fremkom i 1873 to positive anmeldelser af <em>Den
                        romantiske Skole</em> i London-tidsskriftet Athenæum. Edmund W. Gosse
                    fremhæver Brandes som tidens bedste skandinaviske kritiker og er enig i hans syn
                    på dansk og tysk romantik, dog med en kritisk kommentar om, at Brandes overser
                    den store virkning, Jean Pauls havde i Tyskland (Gosse i <em>The Athenæum</em>
                    no. 2406, 6.12.1873, 727-728). Edwin Jessen forsvarer Brandes som religiøs,
                    national og personlig fritænker mod den kristne danske kritik (Jessen: The
                    Athenæum no. 2409, 27.12.1873, s.847). </p>
                <p>Takket være Strodtmanns hurtige oversættelse udkom <em>Den romantiske Skol</em>e
                    på tysk allerede i efteråret 1873 og blev straks omtalt i <em>Magazin für die
                        Literatur des Auslands</em> og <em>Literarisches Zentralblatt</em>. Nogle år
                    efter kommer der længere, samlede anmeldelser af de fire første oversatte bind.
                    Tre hovedpunkter er kendetegnende: forståelsen af, at genren ikke er gængs
                    akademisk litteraturhistorie, men derimod kulturkritik, receptionen af Brandes’
                    metode som en ny litteraturpsykologi og endelig iagttagelsen af forskellen på
                    romantikkens status i Tyskland og Danmark. I Tyskland betragtes den ikke længere
                    som en aktuel kulturperiode, men ses mere distanceret i et historisk lys. Flere
                    anmeldere er godt informeret om forelæsningernes effekt i København og
                    sympatiserer med den i Danmark miskendte Brandes. Især er anmeldelsen i første
                    nummer af det netop grundlagte <em>Deutsche Rundschau</em> positiv. Anmelderen
                    F. Kreyssig skriver om Brandes’ manglende professorat og sympatiserer med hans
                    ”moderne gennembrud”. Han fremhæver Brandes’ metode som original, idet den viser
                    ”die Physiologie der Literatur” (litteraturens fysiologi) begrundet i en
                    udforskning af ”Gedanken- und Empfindungs-Symptome” (tanke- og
                    følelsessymptomer) (Kreyssig i <em>Deutsche Rundschau</em>, Bd. 1, Heft 1,
                    Oktober 1874, s.140). Trods visse lakuner og overlap i litteraturhistorien som
                    følge af den politiske faseinddeling bifalder Kreyssig bindets kritiske
                    romantikopfattelse. <em>Deutsche Rundschau</em> bliver i de følgende årtier
                    Brandes’ vigtigste platform som tysk publicist og kritiker. Hans tyske karriere
                    og rolle som tysk-dansk kulturformidler er kortlagt og analyseret af den danske
                    germanist Klaus Bohnen i talrige udgivelser (fx Bohnen 1980, 2001, 2004). </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Deutsche Rundschau</em> blev i 1870’erne og 1880’erne det kulturelle
                    hovedorgan for det tyske liberalt orienterede borgerskab, der afgrænsede sig
                    ideologisk i forhold til socialdemokraterne, de konservative og Bismarck. Bengt
                    Algot Sørensen gør opmærksom på, at grundlæggeren Julius Rodenberg allerede før
                    det egentlige samarbejde med Brandes havde bestilt anmeldelsen af
                        <em>Hovedstrømninger</em> hos Kreyssig (Sørensen 1980:133), fordi
                        <em>Rundschau</em> kunne gøre fælles sag med Brandes’ kamp for den fri tanke
                    og forskning. I de følgende år skrev Brandes en stor årlig artikel i
                    tidsskriftet: om Lassalle i 1875, om Heyse i 1876 og i 1880’erne introduktioner
                    til den franske realisme og naturalisme (Balzac, Flaubert, Zola m.fl.) og
                    endelig i 1890 om Nietzsche (Sørensen 1980:134). <em>Rundschau</em> udviklede
                    sig imidlertid i en konservativ retning med afvisning af den naturalistiske og
                    efter-naturalistiske litteratur, som Brandes mere og mere orienterer sig hen
                    imod. </p>
                <p>To længere tyske anmeldelser i 1876 skiller sig ud som negative
                    forsvarsreaktioner, der kritiserer Brandes’ tyske romantik-billede. I Wien mente
                    litteraturkritikeren, professor Emil Kuh, at Brandes kæmper fra ”Det unge
                    Tyskland”s forældede bastion. Han forsvarer i sin anmeldelse den tyske romantik
                    over for den franske og gendriver alle Brandes’ karakteristikker af de tyske
                    forfattere fra Goethe og Schiller og frem. Til gengæld nedrakker han ”der
                    schwächliche, verdächtig naive Oehlenschläger” (den svagelige og mistænkeligt
                    naive Oehlenschläger) (Kuh i <em>Beilage zur Wiener Abendpost</em>, 13.4. 1876).
                    Brandes har desuden overset den vigtige senromantik med Eduard Mörike, Ludwig
                    Uhland, Joseph Eichendorff, Robert Schumann, Achim von Arnim og Clemens
                    Brentano, Heinrich Heine og Jacob Grimm. Kuhs dybt konservative observans viser
                    sig i, at han finder Brandes’ portræt af Dorothea Schlegel alt for
                    idealiserende: ”Eine widerwärtigere Grimasse der Weiblichkeit aber, als Dorothea
                    schneidet, ist in der ganzen Hässlichkeitsgalerie der emanzipierten Frauenzimmer
                    nicht anzutreffen” [”en modbydeligere grimasse af kvindelighed end den, som
                    Dorothea skærer, findes ikke i hele hæslighedsgalleriet af emanciperede
                    fruentimmere”] (sms.). Alexander Jung i Leipzig anmelder i 1877
                        <em>Hovedstrømninger</em> over tre numre af <em>Blätter für die literarische
                        Unterhaltung</em> og roser Brandes for at tage højde for den samtidige
                    læsers manglede videns- og dannelsesniveau med sine introduktioner, men synes,
                    at Brandes’ behandling af de tyske forfattere er uansvarlig. Især trækker han
                    Tieck og Jean Paul frem som eksempler. Tieck er med sin ”(…) Allseitigkeit der
                    Bildung, Phantasie, Virtuosität im Uebersetzen (…)” [alsidighed i dannelse,
                    fantasi, virtuositet i oversættelse”] en ånd, som Berlin kan være stolt af at
                    have frembragt (Jung i <em>Blätter für literarische Unterhaltung</em>, Leipzig,
                    nr. 22, 31.5.1877, 341), og Jean Paul kan ikke periodiseres som romantiker eller
                    far til romantikken. Jung bruger den komplekse figur Roquairol i Jean Pauls
                        <em>Titan</em> som eksempel på en idealismekritisk digtning, som Brandes
                    slet ikke har kapacitet til at fatte (Jung 1877:342). Han afslutter sin sidste
                    anmeldelse med et forsvar for Henrich Steffens’ forfatterskab (Jung
                    1877:381-82). </p>

                <h2>d. Andenudgavens modtagelse og efterliv</h2>
                <p> En ny fase i modtagelsen sætter ind omkring Brandes’ tyske andenudgave, som
                    sendes på markedet med en erklæring om, at dette er et ”tysk originalarbejde”.
                    Det skyldes datidens ophavsret, som ikke beskyttede forfatteres copyright til
                    deres værker uden for deres hjemland, hvilket først blev ændret med
                    Bern-konventionen i 1886, som Danmark imidlertid først tiltrådte i 1903. Brandes
                    udgav derfor ikke andenudgaven som en revideret og udvidet udgave af
                    oversættelsen fra 1873, men som et nyskrevet værk, der skulle have sikret
                    forlaget eneretten i de første seks år. Det udløste et sagsanlæg fra forlæggeren
                    Barsdorf, som Brandes forsøgte at tilbagevise ved at argumentere for, at de to
                    værker er grundforskellige. Jørgen Knudsen gengiver Brandes’ argumentation, som
                    også blev trykt i <em>Politiken</em> i sommeren 1887: førsteudgavens angreb på
                    de tyske romantikere var rettet mod de danske romantikere, mens andenudgaven har
                    skiftet optik fra en religiøst og politisk bestemt kritik til en interesse for
                    personlighederne (Knudsen 1994:405-406). </p>
                <p> Det blev diskuteret både i samtiden og siden, om Brandes har ret eller ej; og
                    både anmeldere og forskere er delt i spørgsmålet. Jørgen Knudsen og Bertil Nolin
                    hælder mest til at betragte det som ét værk, mens Jens Bjerring-Hansen viser, at
                    der er tale om en ”ustabil tekst” med to adskilte receptionsspor: et tysk og et
                    dansk. Som påpeget undervejs i dette afsnit har andenudgaven flere
                    forfatterskaber med, disponerer stoffet anderledes i delvis nye kapitler og
                    bruger et mindre polemisk sprog. Romantikken fremstår dermed mere nuanceret,
                    tillige fordi den ses i vekselvirkning og ikke konflikt med de forudgående
                    perioder og fordi andre dimensioner, såsom den romantiske
                    oversættelsesaktivitet, inkluderes. Der er dog hverken rokket ved grundtesen om
                    den særligt tyske romantiske mentalitet eller ved den grundlæggende psykologiske
                    forståelsesoptik. </p>
                <p> De tyske anmeldelser af Brandes’ andenudgave er indlæg i sagen om ophavsret på
                    det tyske marked og efterprøver kritisk ved en sammenligning med førsteudgaven
                    påstanden om, at værket er originalt. Hvor <em>Literarisches Centralblatt</em>
                    (nr. 17, 23.4.1887) afviser det, er <em>Magazin für die Literatur des In- und
                        Auslands</em> (1887, Heft 4, 55) på Brandes’ side. I 1888 udgav en Dr. Puls
                    en omfattende kritik af Brandes’ brug af kilder og arbejdsmetode. Han påviser,
                    at hans citater er fejlfyldte, at han ikke angiver, hvilke tekstudgaver han
                    citerer fra, og værst: at han ikke gør opmærksom på sine tyske forlæg. Puls
                    viser en lang række tekststeder hos Brandes, som er meget tæt på ordlyd og
                    indhold i Rudolf Hayms <em>Die Romantische Schule</em> (1870) og Goedekes
                        <em>Grundriss zur Geschichte der deutschen Dichtung</em> (fra 1857 og frem),
                    og dommen er hård: Brandes mangler ærlighed og videnskabelighed (Puls i
                        <em>Archiv für das Studium der neueren Sprachen und Literaturen</em>, 1888). </p>
                <p> Brandes var allerede før og blev også siden anklaget for plagiat, og det blev
                    brugt imod ham i den danske offentlighed. Det var en indbygget risiko i hans
                    eklektiske arbejdsmetode (Nolin 1965:59, Knudsen 1985:306-08). Imidlertid skal
                        <em>Den romantiske Skole</em> netop ikke måles efter akademiske standarder
                    eller sammenlignes med en filologisk-historisk korrekt og akribisk
                    litteraturhistorie som Hayms, men ses som et kulturhistorisk værk med en stærk
                    effekt på sine læsere. Det er også kendetegnende for bindets virkningshistorie
                    og efterliv. </p>
                <p> I 1891, da andenudgaven udkom på dansk næsten 20 år efter førsteudgaven, er
                    litteraturhistoriens konjunktur skiftet. Som Jens Bjerring-Hansen anfører, kan
                    revisionen af <em>Den romantiske Skole i Tydskland</em> også ses begrundet i
                    Brandes’ sans for, at et nyt kulturelt modernitetsparadigme med symbolisme og
                    nyromantik har vundet indpas og i hans ønske om at gøre sig gældende i en ny
                    verdenslitterær orden. Det er også tydeligt i Brandes’ indsats for at få oversat
                    J.P. Jacobsens Niels Lyhne til tysk, der udkom 1889 (Bohnen 2013). En ny
                    sensibilitet over for romantikken er på færde hos to anmeldere i 1891, nemlig
                    svenskeren Frederik Vetterlund og danskeren Johannes Jørgensen. Hvor Vetterlund
                    ser en kontinuitet i det negative romantiksyn hos Brandes og – med svenskeren
                    Atterbom som eksempel – forsvarer den romantiske længsel som et legitimt behov
                    for transcendens og spiritualitet (Vetterlund i <em>Nordisk Tidskrift för
                        Vetenskap, Konst och Industri</em>, 4. årgang 1891), opfatter Jørgensen
                    andenudgaven som et brud og et nyt romantiksyn. Ungdomsværket havde berettigelse
                    med sin chokeffekt hos dannelsesborgerskabet, der opdagede, at romantikken med
                    sin ”udskejende, fantastiske og ironiske Aand” var en anden end den, de dyrkede
                    (J.J. i <em>Kjøbenhavns Børs-Tidende</em> 14.8.1891). Den nye udgave viser
                    derimod en mere differentieret romantik begyndende med Herder og omfattende
                    flere forskellige personligheder end før. Brandes roses ydermere for at omtale
                    romantikkens oversættelsesaktivitet og dens videnskabelige side med
                    grundlæggelse af myteforskning og sammenlignende sprogvidenskab, og i det hele
                    er ”alt saa dybt og klart forstaaet”. Johannes Jørgensen skrev sin anmeldelse i
                        <em>Kjøbenhavns Børs-Tidende</em>, hvis redaktør var Georg Brandes’ bror,
                    Ernst Brandes. Jørgensen hørte til det kulturradikale miljø, men blev med sin
                    grundlæggelse af tidsskriftet <em>Taarnet</em> i 1893 indstifter af en
                    symbolisme, der slog en bro tilbage til romantikkens tilværelses- og kunstsyn.
                    Det anslås også i anmeldelsens sidste del, som har karakter af digtning:
                        <blockquote>”Der er jo i hin gamle Romantik saa mange Traade, som fortsætter
                        sig ned i de sidste Dages Digtning. Romantikens ironiske Holdning over for
                        Samfundet har jo forberedt den Individernes Frigørelse, som nu foregaar. Og
                        Kulturmennesket drages endnu fra de travle Stæder og Dagens Larm til
                        Skovensomheden og Nattens Fred […]</blockquote></p>

                <p>Brandes’ andenudgave passer ind i et ændret klima i 1890’erne, hvor
                    litteraturhistorikerne Valdemar Vedel og Vilhelm Andersen rehabiliterer den
                    danske romantik. Trods Brandes’ revisioner er det dog hans kritiske
                    romantik-syn, der går i arv til 1900-tallets danske litteraturkritik helt frem
                    til omvurderingen af især den tidlige tyske romantik i fænomenologisk og
                    dekonstruktiv litteraturteori fra 1980’erne (Rosiek 2008:65ff). </p>
                <p> Også da Hovedstrømninger i engelsk oversættelse når over Atlanten i 1902, får
                    værket anmelderne i New York og Boston til at opleve romantikkens aktualitet.
                        <em>The Independent</em> ser den tyske tidlige romantik som en
                    ungdomsrevolte med tilsvarende appel til unge læsere (<em>The Independent</em>,
                    New York, vol. 54, no. 2800, July 31, 1902:1838-1839). <em>The Forum</em>
                    fremhæver især Brandes’ fremstilling af de romantiske kvinder som eksempel på
                    hans brillante kritik og er enig i, at kvinderne var langt mere heroiske end
                    mændene, ”(…) as passion is greater than sentimentalism, life than literature”
                    [”(…)eftersom lidenskab er større end sentimentalisme, og livet er større end
                    litteraturen(…)”] (<em>The Forum</em>, New York, July, 1902:81-84). </p>
                <p><em>Den romantiske Skole i Tydskland</em> har et særligt efterliv i tysk
                    kulturhistorie. Bindets virkningshistorie etableres i årtierne omkring
                    århundredskiftet 1900. Selvom Brandes ikke spiller nogen særlig rolle i
                    faggermanistikken (Bohnen 2004:157), var der dog én vigtig receptionshistorisk
                    instans i den tyske litteraturhistorieskrivning, nemlig Wilhelm Dilthey, der
                    anmeldte første bind af <em>Hovedstrømninger</em> positivt i 1873 og igen i 1882
                    (Bohnen 2001:189). Han interesserer sig for Brandes’ litteraturpsykologiske
                    tilgang (Bohnen 1980:240), og man kan med Klaus Bohnen se Brandes som en
                    forløber for den hermeneutiske litteraturvidenskab og åndshistorie
                    (Geistesgeschichte), som Dilthey grundlagde. </p>
                <p>Som sagt er det førsteudgaven af <em>Den romantiske Skole i Tydskland</em>, der
                    blev udbredt på det tyske bogmarked og intensivt læst i de intellektuelle og
                    kunstneriske miljøer, hvilket utallige udsagn af Arthur Schnitzler, Thomas Mann
                    og Heinrich Mann samt Stefan Zweig vidner om (Bohnen 2001:198-199). Thomas Manns
                    kunstneriske og kulturkritiske reception udgør et tyngdepunkt. Hans-Joachim
                    Sandberg har kortlagt betydningen af <em>Hovedstrømninger</em> for Manns
                    romanforfatterskab fra <em>Buddenbrooks</em> (1901) og frem, mens Steven Cerf
                    viser, at Mann især har været inspireret af Brandes’ suggestive beskrivelse af
                    Novalis under sit arbejde med romanen <em>Der Zauberberg</em> (1924).
                    Romantikerens besættelse af sygdom og erotiske dyrkelse af smerte og død bliver
                    en model for Hans Castorp-figuren (Cerf 1981:124-25), og Brandes’
                    romantik-formidling kan dermed betragtes som en vigtig inspirationskilde til
                    Manns ironiske romantik-forståelse. Der er en vis parallelitet mellem Brandes’
                    fremstilling af det særligt tyske i <em>Den romantiske Skole i Tydskland</em> og
                    Manns indflydelsesrige kulturkritiske bog <em>Betrachtungen eines
                        Unpolitischen</em> (1918) med dens positive bestemmelse af (tysk) kultur som
                    uforenelig med (vestlig) civilisation og dermed med demokratiet i Frankrig,
                    England og USA. Mann ændrede som bekendt politisk opfattelse nogle år senere og
                    forsvarer i sin tale ”Von deutscher Republik” (1923) Weimar-republikken og det
                    første tyske demokrati, men stadig med romantikken og Novalis som et vigtigt
                    omdrejningspunkt. </p>
                <p>Brandes’ <em>Den romantiske Skole i Tydskland</em> har været en stor kunstnerisk
                    inspiration uden for Danmarks grænser og er med sit forsvar for en engageret
                    litteratur og med sin fordømmelse og fascination af romantikken en stadig
                    reference i dansk kulturliv. </p>

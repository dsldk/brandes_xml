            <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
            <p><em>Naturalism in England</em>, the volume on literature in the English language as
                it had developed at the beginning of the 19th century, was published at the end of
                1875. While the title might suggest that the theme is “English” literature, it is in
                fact more broadly the literature of Great Britain, since in addition to the English
                poets Brandes includes in his analytic portraits the Scotsman Walter Scott and the
                Irishman Thomas Moore (Ireland having been ruled by Westminster until 1922). Since
                Brandes places much emphasis on the national strain in the authorships he treats, it
                is thus more correct to refer to the volume as an analysis of <em>British</em>
                literature, as shall be maintained hereafter.</p>
            <p>Of the six volumes of <em>Main Currents</em>, three are concerned with French
                literature, two with German and only one with British. Thus, there appears to be an
                imbalance in the respective significance attributed to the three national
                literatures. That the <em>Morgenbladet</em> reviewer (perhaps Edvard Brandes?) can
                ultimately assert that <em>Naturalism in England</em> is the “fourth, greatest, and
                most important volume in Brandes’ work” is attributable to the fact that it contains
                the portrait of George Gordon Byron (after 1798 Lord Byron), the hero of freedom who
                constitutes the culmination of the movements in European intellectual life that
                Brandes had described in the earlier volumes. This is already anticipated in the
                introductory lecture to <em>Emigrant Literature</em> (1872), in which Lord Byron’s
                works are said to mark a turning point.</p>
            <p>In the 1923 edition of the first volume of <em>Main Currents</em> (<em>Emigrant
                    Literature</em>), Brandes reflects on his entire project as constituting a
                “piece of the history of the European soul” (Brandes 1923:3) as anchored in
                politics. Already in the original edition of 1872 he makes it clear that the
                literary production of the era must be seen as the decisive factor in “the final
                victory of freethinking” (Brandes 1872:7). Byron’s poetry is an important part of
                this development, since it was published at a time in which religion and
                authoritarian ideas had trampled revolutionary sentiments under foot, thus once
                again establishing a dominant position. Byron signals the return of freethinking,
                after which the continental revolutions of 1848 put an end to tyranny and to captive
                intellectual life in many places across Europe. Only Denmark remained unchanged and
                thus weighed down by reactionary sentiments.</p>
            <p>“Naturalism,” the unifying principle in the in the volume, is Brandes’ name for a
                literary orientation that breaks with the traditions that constantly limit the
                possibilities of human development and novelty (it is in the natural landscape, at
                sea, and among the animals that we can distance ourselves from society and
                reconstruct the subjugated self). The English-speaking authors are treated not just
                for the literary qualities but also for their indirect as well as direct political
                engagement.</p>
            <p>As much as <em>Naturalism in England</em> is a literary history, it is just as much a
                defense of engaged and socially critical poetry, which serves as an example that may
                move the Danish reader to employ literary art in a new manner.</p>

            <h1>2. Background and Genesis</h1>
            <div>
                <h2>a. Agony and Inspiration</h2>
                <p>The lectures that formed the basis of Naturalism in England were delivered in the
                    spring of 1874 and, after a stay in Germany, in April and October of 1975; the
                    volume appeared on November 12th, 1875. Brandes himself relates that his
                    collection of the material took place under “unfavorable conditions,” as he was
                    staying with his parents in Krystalgade, Copenhagen, in a little room with a
                    view of a garden wall and with the constant “hellish racket” of a piano teacher
                    in the background (Brandes 1907:154). Eighteen-seventy-five was a year in which
                    Brandes’ marital agonies worsened and in which he was plagued by several small
                    ailments such as diphtheria and a paralysis of the palette that made it
                    difficult to speak (Brandes 1907:174). There was briefly hope of an opening in
                    the impasse that was Brandes’ application to the university when a new Minister
                    of Culture, J.C.H. Fischer (1814-1885), was appointed by the government of
                    J.B.S. Estrup. Because Fischer was in an unmarried relationship he was
                    considered a “freethinker,” yet any possibility of a more tolerant attitude
                    toward Brandes and his application was soon extinguished when one of his old
                    opponents, Hans Lassen Martensen, Bishop of Sjælland, intervened in the
                    matter.</p>
                <p>There was, however, a silver lining. While Brandes was working on the
                    English-language material, Frederik Hegel, director of the Gyldendal publishing
                    house, arranged for him to found the cultural journal <em>Det nittende
                        Aarhundrede: Maanedsskrift for Literatur and Kritik</em>, which was
                    published between 1874 and 1877. Brandes and his brother Edvard became the
                    editors of the new periodical, which was intended to be a channel for the
                    liberal and anti-clerical culture war that was also written into the fabric of
                        <em>Main Currents</em>. In one of the issues, Brandes published an essay on
                    the English poet Percy Bysshe Shelley (Brandes 1875b), who was presented as a
                    forerunner of such progressive attitudes. The essay was based on the two-hour
                    lecture on the poet Brandes had delivered at the Studenterforening in April.
                    While most Danish readers were aware of authors like Walter Scott and Lord
                    Byron, Shelley remained as good as unknown, as only a few sporadic examples of
                    his poetry had been translated into Danish. Brandes’ Studenterforeningen lecture
                    was thus erroneously billed as an address on “Schelling” (Brandes 1907:174), the
                    German Romantic and philosopher much better known in Denmark.</p>
                <p>It is evident that Brandes had only become acquainted with many of the poems
                    treated in Naturalism in England shortly before the publication of the volume.
                    Yet he was already familiar, in greater or lesser degrees, with many of the
                    authors themselves. An 1861 note in his diary, for example, indicates that he
                    had read a biographical article on Shelley in <em>Fædrelandet</em> (Dagbog
                    1861:100). But it was the personal meeting with the English critic and author
                    Edmund Gosse (1849-1928) that proved decisive in the shaping of <em>Naturalism
                        in England</em>. Gosse, who had learned Danish and was interested in
                    Scandinavian literature, visited many Danish authors, making contact with
                    Brandes in May of 1874. Brandes ascribes great significance to the meetings in
                    his <em>Memoirs</em>: “Gosse’s visit provided a new opening for my study of
                    English poetry. His enthusiasm struck a chord with me” (Brandes 1907:157). The
                    two men arranged to read their respective national literatures aloud to one
                    another. Gosse relates that during their morning meetings he recited, among
                    others, Shelley, William Wordsworth, and A.C. Swinburne. He especially recalls
                    an episode in which read Shelley’s “Ode to the West Wind,” of which Brandes at
                    that point was unaware. During the recitation Brandes “shivered with pleasure,”
                    and upon its final line fell back on the sofa, entranced by the beauty of the
                    poem (Gosse 1911:288-9). Brandes would later refer to this ode as Shelley’s
                    “mightiest poem” (Brandes 1875a:324-5).</p>
                <p>It was Gosse who provided Brandes with insight into how British authors were
                    generally viewed and judged. He also gave Brandes the incentive to revise the
                    canon. Thus, in his <em>Memoirs</em> Brandes writes that Gosse “was the first
                    who taught me how much more highly the artists of modern England esteemed
                    Shelley, Keats and Coleridge than Byron, and how strongly the bourgeoisie
                    preferred Wordsworth to him” (Brandes 1907:157). In the revolt against petite
                    bourgeois values that is written large in <em>Naturalism in England</em>, it is
                    precisely Byron who comes to the forefront and Wordsworth who is downgraded.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>b. The English Language</h2>
                <p>If the analysis of the British material receives less attention from the author –
                    measured in page count – than German and French literature, it is partly due to
                    the generally lesser impact exerted by English literature in Denmark of the
                    1870s. Yet in the second half of the 19th century a rising number of Danish
                    translations from English were published, both of Romantic and of contemporary
                    literature (see Downs 1948).</p>
                <p>One unavoidable question in this context involves Brandes’ reasons for writing
                        <em>Naturalism in England</em>. His knowledge of English was limited.
                    Instruction in it had not been a part of his schooling, as traditionally French
                    and German were the common foreign languages of Denmark. Yet there was a rising
                    acknowledgment of the importance of English. Copenhagen University established a
                    professorship of English in 1851, which was occupied by the eccentric George
                    Stephens, and in 1864 it first become possible to choose English as an elective
                    in the school system (Rasmussen 2003:83-4). Even though Brandes had acquired
                    solid competence in reading English, his command of the spoken language was
                    lacking. When during a three-week visit to England in 1870 he had met the
                    utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill, whose <em>The Subjection of Women</em>
                    he had translated into Danish, they spoke French together.</p>
                <p>Gosse recalls from his time in Copenhagen that “Brandes had a good knowledge of
                    literary English and was accustomed to the pronunciation, but he did not trust
                    himself to talk.” Therefore they spoke Danish when together. Gosse also mentions
                    that Brandes had difficulty grasping the metrics of English lyric and was
                    especially tone deaf to the metrical foot anapaest. In an 1895 appearance at The
                    London Author’s Club, twenty years after the publication of <em>Naturalism in
                        England</em>, Brandes acknowledges as much: “Although I, as you can hear,
                    speak English quite poorly, I can reassure you that I read it with ease”
                    (Brandes 1905:428).</p>
                <p>In the volume on British literature it can be observed that the section that had
                    been used as the basis of the Shelley lecture at the
                        <em>Studenterforeningen</em> primarily provide the readers with Danish prose
                    renderings or paraphrases of the poems so that Brandes would not have read aloud
                    too many direct citations from the English. In his correspondence with his soon
                    to be wife, Henriette Strodtmann, Brandes notes that he had used a German
                    translation of Shelley’s works, but had however found that the poet was awful in
                    this language (cited in Nolin 1965:195).</p>

            <h1>3. Method, Canon and Conceptual Apparatus</h1>
            <div>
                <h2>a. A Characterization of Naturalism in England</h2>
                <p> In <em>Naturalism in England</em> we witness the culmination of what Brandes had
                    built up to in the previous volume, <em>The Reaction in France</em>, in which he
                    discusses the return of authoritarian ideas. Naturalism is the literary mode
                    Brandes sees as the means of realizing freethinking. He thus begins the volume
                    by describing the political situation of Great Britain at the beginning of the
                    19th century: the tyranny of the Church and the monarchy, the fear of revolution
                    among the establishment classes, and the imperialistic tendencies. Political
                    domination and cultural stagnation function as the taking-off point for the
                    selection of the authors for the volume, all of whom are evaluated according to
                    their ability to take account of the political power of the dominate class. </p>
                <p>As noted, Brandes attributes great political and cultural significance to Byron’s
                    works, which were published between 1807 and his death in 1824. Yet the subtitle
                    of <em>Naturalism in England</em>, “Byron and his Group,” is misleading, since
                    the poets were not a cohesive group and many of the older authors were deeply
                    critical of George Gordon Byron. But in his chosen title Brandes signals his
                    underlying agenda: the nature-oriented literature from the beginning of the 19th
                    century can be understood as an overture to Byron, whose poetry functions as the
                    climax of the book. This model of analysis, which has a clear goal in sight,
                    appears to justify Brandes holding up Byron’s poetry as a yardstick for the
                    other naturalistic authors in the volume in a manner that is always unfavorable
                    to them. </p>
                <p>The material in <em>Naturalism in England</em> falls chiefly into two sections,
                    although with respect to page count or to Brandes’ judgment they are hardly
                    equal. The first and shortest section addresses the first generation of nature
                    poets, the so-called “Lake Poet School,” as they were dubbed by the influential
                    Edinburgh critic Francis Jeffrey. This group includes William Wordsworth, Samuel
                    Taylor Coleridge, and Robert Southey, each of which was connected to the Lake
                    District of northwest England. In reality they never constituted an actual
                    “school” with a common program, but in Brandes’ view they all share a movement
                    from radical sympathies in their youth toward a later conservative ideology.
                    Brandes also sees the Scottish writer Walter Scott as belonging to this old
                    guard.</p>
                <p>Despite the immense literary significance of these authors, they are for Brandes
                    political apostates, and discussion of them functions in part as a prelude to
                    the second half of the volume in which the younger generation of poets is
                    addressed. The first of these young poets is John Keats. He is followed by a
                    chapter on the Irishman Thomas Moore, who is viewed as an erotic poet but whose
                    political rebelliousness provides Brandes with an occasion for a long historical
                    elucidation of the Irish Rebellion at the turn of the 19th century. The
                    cultural-historical development that Brandes describes builds to a crescendo via
                    the controversial poet Shelley, after which the volume culminates in a 170-page
                    treatment of Byron. That Byron would be placed so prominently in <em>Main
                        Currents</em> had already been presaged in <em>The Reaction in
                    France</em>:</p>
                <blockquote> In Napoleon positive greatness had fallen, the real hero of an age
                    vanished from the Earth. Human admiration was as empty as a pedestal from which
                    the statue had been removed. Lord Byron occupied the empty space anew with the
                    fantastical greatness of the hero. Napoleon had replaced Werther, René and
                    Faust; the promethean and desperate heroism of Byron replaced Napoleon. He was
                    marvelously attuned to the needs of the age. (Brandes 1874:348).</blockquote>

            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>b. Literary-Historical Methodology: Hippolyte Taine</h2>
                <p> A general tendency of the 19th century was to tie literary studies to historical
                    empiricism and to leave aesthetics to philosophy. Brandes’ method of literary
                    criticism incorporates that of the French critic Charles-Augustin Sainte-Beuve
                    (1804-69), who is especially associated with a biographical approach to
                    literature. Yet with respect to Byron, Brandes cultivates an exorbitantly
                    admiring approach that distinguishes itself from Sainte-Beuve.</p>
                <p>The other great source of inspiration is Hippolyte Taine (1828-1898), whom
                    Brandes had addressed in his dissertation of 1870, and with whom he had both
                    corresponded and met personally. In the fourth volume of Taine’s <em>Histoire de
                        la littérature anglaise</em> [The History of English Literature], published
                    in 1864, early 19th century literature is described as a part of “l’âge moderne”
                    [the modern age], which not only involved a break with Neoclassical forms in
                    poetry, but also a flourishing of new revolutionary thoughts. It is this same
                    frame of understanding we find in Brandes’ writing. Many of the literary figures
                    are also the same, and the greatest poet, toward whom all early 19th poetry
                    pointed, is Byron, the only figure to warrant his own chapter in Taine’s account
                    of the period.</p>
                <p>The systematic method of literary criticism that Brandes implicitly employs in
                    his analysis can also be traced back to Taine, including the three main
                    principals of the understanding of literary production: <em>race</em> (national
                    character), <em>milieu</em> (the author’s environment), and le moment (the
                    historical circumstances). It is from these three parameters that the author
                    should be understood, as well as the national tradition of which the author is a
                    part. Yet Brandes broadens the literary critical scope, for whereas Taine sees
                    the literary product as the final result of the three conditions, Brandes
                    emphasizes how the work is subsequently transmitted, and how it influences and
                    inspires later authors. Brandes judges works according to their ability to
                    inspire political debate, which is the criterion that distinguishes him from
                    Taine’s more apolitical criticism (see Levin 1963:13-14; Wellek 1968:359). </p>
                <p>Taine’s concept of <em>race</em> receives a measure of special attention from
                    Brandes. Thus he suggests that Walter Scott, through his “detective’s gaze,”
                    attempted to capture in his historical novels concepts such as the “natural
                    substance” and “psychology of the folk” (Brandes 1875a:183). These national
                    traits are in part the result of climactic and hereditary circumstances. Taine
                    describes, for example, Byron’s rebellious instinct as springing from the cold
                    northern climate: it affected his pride, gave his powers of representation a
                    wildness, sharpened his appetite for destruction, and fostered the kind of
                    frenzy in him that had driven the Scandinavian berserks, who had conquered and
                    settled England (Taine 1864:528-9). Brandes also refers to Byron’s Scandinavian
                    ancestors, when he infers that the poet chose to become an officer in the Greek
                    War of Independence because “the Viking blood in his veins could not give him
                    peace until he himself had become a Viking king just the like the Normans from
                    whom he descended” (Brandes 1875a:479-80).</p>
                <p>Taine received a measure of attention in Denmark during the second half of the
                    19th century. His analyses of Alfred Lord Tennyson and Alfred de Musset were
                    translated by Rudolf Schmidt and published in the anthology <em>Stories and
                        Sketches</em> in 1867. And as Brandes began writing Naturalism in England,
                    H.S. Vodskov’s translation of Taine’s <em>The History of English Literature</em>
                    (4 vols., 1874-77) was already in the works.</p>
                <p>On the whole, literary histories à la Taine are at a premium in late 19th-century
                    Denmark. Julius Paludan, for example, published <em>A Sketch of the History of
                        French National Literature</em> in 1874, and part of the same period is
                    covered in <em> French Literature of the 18th Century</em> (1876), which is an
                    excerpt H. Schwanenflügel had translated from Hermann Hettner’s highly esteemed
                        <em>Literaturgeschichte des achtzhenten Jahrhunderts</em> (1856-70).
                    Methodologically Taine also inspired others than Brandes in the Danish cultural
                    landscape, including literary history professor Valdemar Vedel (1865-1942) and
                    especially those who worked on the cultural ideals of the Middle Ages.</p>

                <h2>c. The Physiognomic Approach</h2>
                <p>Another largely overlooked implement that Brandes borrowed from Taine is the
                    physiognomic approach to the analysis of the authorships. This is the idea that
                    the physical appearance of the poet is reflected in his work. <em>The History of
                        English Literature</em> begins with a long passage on how the inner man can
                    be extrapolated from the outer, which leads up to a formulation of the three
                    elements of literary analysis described above.</p>
                <p>Physiognomically-oriented literary criticism is not limited to Taine, but was a
                    theme within French, German and English criticism throughout the 19th century
                    (Tylor 1982:82-122). Many times, Brandes introduces his author portraits with a
                    description of the poet’s external appearance in order to understand the anatomy
                    of his work. For example, we learn that Keats’ “appearance corresponded to the
                    impression we now receive from his poetry.” Brandes describes the “earthy and
                    heavy-footed Keats” as having “a broad and powerful chest with strong shoulders
                    . . . eyes large, glowing and dark blue and glinting with strong palpitations of
                    the mind” (Brandes 1875a:203-4). This can be compared with Brandes’ portrayal of
                    the “sensuality” in Keats’ poetry, which emerges as “sturdy and heavy” (Brandes
                    1875a:208) and is expressive of the enjoyment of all the impressions the
                    physiological senses can discover (Brandes 1875a:210-12).</p>
                <p> In contrast to Keats, we encounter “the ethereal and feminine Shelley,” who is a
                    “slender, delicate and small-shouldered figure” (Brandes 1875a:203) and whose
                    eye is “womanly and almost seraphic in its gaze” (Brandes 1875a:307). This
                    coheres nicely with his poetry, in which his hero Alastor is “the spirit of the
                    wind and the air with luminous eyes, refreshing breath and a light gait”
                    (Brandes 1875a:315). Yet as Brandes wrote in the preface to Johannes Magnussen’s
                    translation of Shelley’s The Cenci, there is a contradiction between the
                    physical poet and the inspiration he shall use to change the world: “Shelley’s
                    delicate and brittle body” could not “bear his exalted powers of imagination.”
                    This renders Shelley unsuitable to carry the banner of the political
                    transformation the world had been expecting, and thus he goes to ruin as a
                    “martyr of the imagination” (Brandes 1878a:iv).</p>
                <p> There are, however, further examples in <em>Naturalism in England</em> of strong
                    poets who are possessed of robustness and flair. The brow of the Irish
                    national-political poet Thomas Moore, for example, is described as “large and
                    radiant” and “so interesting that it would send a phrenologist into convulsions”
                    (Brandes 1875a:238). The portrait of Byron, whose poems heralded a coming
                    cultural and political storm over calcified Europe, begins with a reference to
                    Bertel Thorvaldsen’s 1821 bust of the poet, in which Brandes notes that the
                    sculptor had provided a brow on which “clouds might gather . . . and lightning
                    flash from the clouds, and from something violent in the gaze” (Brandes
                    1875a:358). </p>
                <p>With Taine as his intellectual mentor, Brandes emphasizes that the life of the
                    author is the chief source for understanding the work. When it comes to the
                    judging of the literary quality of an authorship, Brandes invariably links this
                    with an evaluation of the author’s biography. Since it is Brandes’ aim to
                    construct an image of the great poets as castigators of society who – according
                    to the nature of the matter – must necessarily be controversial in their own
                    age, he almost draws an equivalence between the adversity encountered by the
                    author and the ability to create great art. The primary examples of this are
                    Shelley and Byron, who had to struggle against the condemnation of their
                    surroundings, as well as Keats, whose lovely verse was written “amidst great
                    agony” (Brandes 1875a:221).</p>
                <p>In the other camp are Coleridge and Wordsworth, whom Brandes desires to pull down
                    from their pedestals. Coleridge was “will-less” and “like a child allowed his
                    life to be preserved by others” (Brandes 1875a:131); his poetry is therefore not
                    ultimately successful. Wordsworth is portrayed as a poet who lived an “idyllic
                    and protected life” (79) devoid of any external events that might “inflame the
                    passions in his poetry” (80). Yet here Brandes leaves out Wordsworth’s sojourn
                    in France during the Revolution as well as the financial problems that forced
                    him to return home. Thus, it can be said that there is a certain selectivity in
                    the his arrangement of the biographical material; and it is no accident that
                    Brandes chooses to focus on anecdotes about the conservative Wordsworth’s
                    obstinate self-absorption and various caprices. It borders on character
                    assassination that in turn functions as legitimization of Brandes’ critique of
                    the limited literary merits of the poet. In this endeavor Brandes was assisted
                    by the Edinburgh professor David Masson’s <em>Wordsworth, Shelley, Keats and
                        Other Essays</em> (1874), from which he borrowed many of the anecdotes that
                    are re-presented in <em>Naturalism in England</em>. And, like Masson (Masson
                    1874:34-5,68), Brandes also compares Wordsworth negatively with the much more
                    rebellious Byron.</p>
                <p>A distinguishing characteristic that seems to render Brandes’ text foreign in
                    relation to modern critical praxis is that at times he borrows literary themes
                    and images from the works he discusses. An example of this is the transition he
                    makes from the first generation of poets, who had already sold themselves to the
                    conservatism of the status quo, to the young and indisposed poets (Brandes
                    1875a:196). This is laid out in a reading of John Keats’ unfinished epic
                        <em>Hyperion</em> (1818-19), from which Brandes cites the tribute to the god
                    Apollo. Here a new era is heralded for the Gods of Olympus after the fall of
                    their old overlord Saturn and his titans; Brandes appropriates this as a
                    relevant image of the inauguration of a new age in 19th-century literature.
                    Brandes also allows the voice of the literary critic to blend into the object of
                    analysis, as when he describes Keats as the nightingale the poet had been
                    captivated by in the famous “Ode to a Nightingale”: Keats is like a “radiant
                    bird that rises high up into the air from Wordsworth’s ancient many-leaved oak”
                    (Brandes 1875a:201). This undeniably introduces a certain form of pathos into
                    Brandes’ criticism, which Jørgen Knudsen characterizes as the “exaggerated
                    language” of the volume that constitutes “glaze atop the viscous cake” (Knudsen
                    1985:387). An example of Brandes’ penchant for metaphorical formulations can
                    also be located in the reference to Byron’s <em>Childe Harolde’s
                        Pilgrimmage</em>, Canto III, in which the reader becomes an observer of a
                    waterfall, which “ in the raging white froth, swirled into the maelstrom, split
                    . . . everything that stood in its way, indeed in the long run hollowed out the
                    rocks” and yet in its middle brought forth “a magnificent radiant rainbow, a
                    sign of harmony and peace and the love of freedom.” This kind of nature
                    description is read allegorically as a portent of the “better days for Europe”
                    that shall follow in the wake of Byron’s powerful poetry” (Brandes
                    1875a:527).</p>

            <div>
                <h2>d. Naturalism as Concept</h2>
                <p>The various authors addressed in <em>Naturalism in England</em> would be placed
                    under the category of “Romanticism” in modern textbooks. Yet Brandes desires to
                    group them under the concept of “Naturalism.” Of all Brandes’ literary terms
                    this the one that has most often raised eyebrows and which always demands
                    explanation when it is mentioned. This is because “Naturalism” is today almost
                    automatically associated with the literary approach of Émile Zola, as expressed,
                    for example, in his 1881 Les Romanciers naturalistes [<em>The Naturalist
                        Novelists</em>], in which modern literature is characterized as the
                    presentation of realistic social and psychological sequences of events. That
                    such a connection has come about is related to the fact that Naturalism was
                    later tied to the Modern Breakthrough in Scandinavian literature after 1870, in
                    which Brandes was a key figure.</p>
                <p>But what did Brandes mean by the concept when he originally used it? <em>In The
                        Men of the Modern Breakthrough</em> he notes that Naturalism is a “quite
                    comprehensive word” and can connote both the “most delicate elven melodies” of
                    Shelley as well as the prosaic scenes of Zola (1883:398). Yet as Zola’s
                    conceptual explanation took hold and gained dominance, Brandes sharpened the
                    distinction between these poles. In the preface to the fifth edition of Main
                    Currents he writes that the concept of Naturalism “was shaped by me a decade
                    before Zola introduced it into France in an entirely different sense than I had
                    given it: the love of nature” (Brandes 1923:4). Bertil Nolin has suggested that
                    Brandes’ conception of Naturalism is borrowed from the German literary
                    historians Rudolf Haym, Hermann Hettner and Julian Schmidt, to whom he refers in
                        <em>The Romantic School in Germany</em> (Nolin 1965:192). In <em>Naturalism
                        in England</em>, however, Brandes focuses on “the love of nature” as an
                    opposing pole to the artificial order of established society and to political
                    repression. In this sense he recalls Jean Jacques Rousseau’s idea that humanity
                    is at its best in the natural state: “applied to society Naturalism becomes, as
                    it already was for Rousseau, revolutionary” (Brandes 1875a:19). Nature becomes
                    the vehicle of freethinking, by which Brandes’ concept of Naturalism can acquire
                    a series of overlapping meanings. Toward the end of the volume he notes in
                    summary that the British authors “prefer the forest to the sea, natural man to
                    salon man, and the original expression of passion to its artificial language”
                    (Brandes 1875a:483). It is worth briefly attending to these three elements in
                    order to understand the significance Brandes attributes to Naturalism as a
                    literary orientation.</p>
                <p> Whereas German Romanticism was marked by the supernatural and the Danish
                    iteration was centered on the rediscovery of the Scandinavian and Old Norse
                    past, its national character in Great Britain was that of “worshipping . . .
                    nature” (Brandes 1875a:12-13). This involved interest in landscape and in the
                    sea (not unnatural for a seafaring nation), as well as a warm affection for the
                    animal world (Brandes 1875a:12-25). But this entails more than just a
                    reproduction of physical objects as in landscape painting. The observation of
                    nature is filtered through the form of highly developed “sensibility” (that is,
                    the ability to feel and to sense) that Brandes sees in Moore and Keats. He
                    further identifies an over-imaginative “pantheism” in Wordsworth (62-3), Keats
                    (Brandes 1875a:210), and Shelley (Brandes 1875a:307). Thus, in Wordsworth there
                    is a suggestion of the reactivation of the mystical understanding of “the poetry
                    of nature” (Brandes 1875a:87). This is the result of the displacement of
                    traditional Christianity by nature mysticism, which Brandes traces back to
                    Spinoza and Jakob Böhme (Brandes 1875a:55). This reading had already been
                    introduced in <em>The Romantic School in Germany</em>, in which Brandes
                    describes how nature replaces religion (Brandes 1873:124-5,239-40). This
                    displacement would later be mapped out by the American critic M.H. Abrams under
                    the heading of <em>Natural Supernaturalism</em> (1971), the title of his
                    influential thesis on both German and English Romanticism.</p>
                <p>Brandes’ designation of “natural man” is perhaps best understood through his
                    description of Wordsworth’s “naturalistic passion” for the “peasants and rural
                    folk,” who live with and through nature (Brandes 1875a:103). As Wordsworth
                    expresses in his landmark “Preface” to <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> (1802), it is
                    the rural population who are the real philosophers of the age, in that they are
                    in close contact with nature and learn from it. Wordsworth therefore imitates a
                    “natural prose dialogue” (Brandes 1875a:58), which (in modified form) resembles
                    the language spoken by “the common people of the countryside.” Brandes
                    designates the dismantling of the artificial and stilted Neoclassical style as
                    “the most extreme literary consequence of Naturalism” (Brandes 1875a:105).
                    Brandes sees a common thread in the various authors treated in <em>Naturalism in
                        England</em> in the fact that each breaks with the salon style and the
                    rigidly Neoclassical rhyming pattern that dominated the poetry of Alexander Pope
                    (1688-1744) and the “stiff school of art” that had “perfumed the air with
                    affectation” during the 18th century (Brandes 1875a:314). Continuing in this
                    vein, Brandes at times allows his ideas about the Naturalist love of nature to
                    be reflected in an author’s aesthetics: Thomas Moore’s <em>Irish Melodies</em>,
                    for example, are described as poems that can “murmur like the waves of the sea
                    and with the overwhelming force of a natural element” (Brandes 1875a:263). On
                    the other hand, Brandes also insists that the portraits of nature created by the
                    Naturalist authors are not only illustrations of feelings, but are also true to
                    nature, indeed even scientifically accurate. Thus, in Walter Scott’s works he
                    observes “portraits of nature” so accurate that “a botanist could well
                    familiarize himself with the vegetation of the area from them” (Brandes
                    1875a:13). </p>
                <p>Even though Brandes later insisted on distinguishing his conception of Naturalism
                    from Zola’s hyperrealism, he still understands the British authors as advocates
                    of realism in nature. With respect to Wordsworth’s “She was a phantom of
                    delight,” for example, he praises its presentation of an “authentically
                    naturalistic ideal of the English female type” (Brandes 1875a:78), that is to
                    say, that her beauty is not mythologized or unnecessarily embellished. Brandes
                    also alludes to realism in literature when he adopts the skepticism Taine
                    reserved for Scott’s popular historical novels. Brandes thus cites the novel
                    series <em>Tales of the Crusaders</em>, and specifically <em>The Talisman</em>
                    (1825), as works that are not faithful to truth, but “popular fictions about the
                    fairytale world of the crusaders and their wondrous deeds” (Brandes 1875a:193).
                    The contrast here is Byron, whose “direct clear vision” was capable of “grasping
                    all that science seeks and demonstrates” even in age before the natural sciences
                    had truly triumphed (Brandes 1875a:195-6). Science, as Brandes understands it,
                    is bound up with the inclination to revise hallowed yet incorrect understandings
                    of the world. Here he is thinking not the least of Byron’s distancing himself
                    from Christianity (Brandes 1875a:447), which chimes with his own hard stance
                    against the religion. </p>
                <p>In Brandes’ conceptual usage, the term “Romantic” is reserved for the literature
                    that takes inspiration from the Middle Ages and its magical Romances. Thus, for
                    Brandes it is “the truth of nature” in Wordsworth that distinguished him and the
                    other British authors from the German Romantics, who revel in the “supernatural
                    or fantastic” (Brandes 1875a:88). Yet examples of the supernatural can be
                    located in the English material, such as in Scott’s semi-Gothic <em>Lay of the
                        Last Minstrel</em> and in the enchanted dreams of Coleridge’s unfinished
                        <em>Christabel</em> (Brandes 1875a:118). Brandes views Coleridge as the
                    chief exponent of “romantic-fantastic” poetry, which “neither presents an
                    energetic, lively and personal life of a soul nor reproduces observations of the
                    surrounding world” (Brandes 1875a:128). Coleridge borrows from the German
                    Romantics whom Brandes had criticized in a prior volume of <em>Main
                        Currents</em>, thereby registering “an abstract scientific protest against
                    the Enlightenment.” Brandes views rationalism as a distinguishing characteristic
                    of the English national spirit, of which the empiricist philosopher David Hume
                    (1711-76) is the doyen. Within this frame, Coleridge’s poetry is designated as
                    downright “unenglish,” in that he makes himself the “representative of the
                    German philosophy of the past,” which is “in opposition to the experimental
                    character of English science” (Brandes 1875a:11). Scott’s dreams and prophecies
                    belong in the same way to the “Romanticism of the Uncanny” as it is found in
                    Germany in Novalis or Hoffmann (Brandes 1875a:175).</p>
                <p>Brandes is also skeptical of Southey’s “exterior Romanticism,” which makes use of
                    “all the superstition of Arabia and all the most fantastic dreams of the Orient”
                    (Brandes 1875a:144). Brandes’ specialized employment of the term “Romantic” is
                    not unusual for his time, but it departs from Taine, who refers to the same
                    group of authors treated by Brandes as “L’école romantique” [the Romantic
                    School]. Brandes also distances himself from his Danish predecessors, such as
                    the critic Knud Lyne Rahbek, who for example in an 1820 Tilskueren article had
                    designated Byron, Scott, and Moore as “Romantics” in contrast to the “classical
                    poets from the age of Queen Anne” (cited in Nielsen 1976:281). </p>
                <p>Even though the authors adhere to the practice of describing nature in a manner
                    faithful to reality, Brandes evaluates them differently, depending on what they
                    esteem in the natural landscape and how they communicate it to the reader. For
                    example, Brandes ties the rebelliousness in Byron’s temperament to his landscape
                    portraiture in <em>Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</em>. According to Brandes, these
                    passages demonstrate how Byron loved nature for its wrath, which stands in
                    contrast to Wordsworth’s affection for nature in its peacefulness (Brandes
                    1875a:423). Brandes points to a distinction here that could have been further
                    supported by citing Byron’s lines from Canto II: “she [nature] is fairest in her
                    features wild” (Byron 1833:81). Yet Brandes’ distinction between the two poets
                    ought to be qualified by the fact that Canto III, 65-109, also contains a
                    philosophical appraisal of nature in its peacefulness, and that often in
                    Wordsworth we find descriptions of wild and sublime landscapes.</p>
                <p>If we are to understand Brandes’ volume as a general overview of British writers
                    at the beginning of the 19th century, then “Naturalism” is too narrow and too
                    politicized a frame to represent the literature of the age in its fullness. As
                    literary concept it is more properly understood as carefully selected focus that
                    represents only a portion of the authors’ total production. “Naturalism” is an
                    ideal Brandes desires to employ in order to pass judgement according to how well
                    the writers fulfill its potential. At the same time, he outlines a developmental
                    history that points to Byron as the literary figure against which all early 19th
                    -century literature should be counterbalanced.</p>

                <h2>e. The Grand Narrative of Freethinking</h2>
                <p>In the introduction to the first volume of <em>Main Currents</em> Brandes had
                    employed the classical metaphor of the <em>teatrum mundi</em> to describe the
                    shift heralded by Byron: The Napoleonic Wars are the stage on which this poet
                    “brings about the reversal in the great drama,” and when this great poet fell in
                    the Greek war for freedom, his “hero’s death” makes “an enormous impression on
                    all the writers of the continent” (Brandes 1875a:13). Byron’s poetry, especially
                    the poem <em>Don Juan</em>, is the culmination of Naturalism, a trumpet fanfare
                    for the awakening that brings back the lost spirit of rebellion to European
                    cultural history. A Hegelian manner of thinking can be sensed in this drama
                    (Ahlström 1937:36-7), and the direction is clear: it is a movement toward
                    freethinking. It is this grand narrative that shall be discussed and evaluated
                    in the following section. </p>
                <p>In <em>Main Currents</em> we follow along with the European spirit that moved
                    from revolution at the conclusion of the 18th century toward reaction at the
                    beginning of the 19th and so turned back again toward an intuition of freedom.
                    Brandes illuminates the same movement in miniature in British literary history.
                    The early Lake Poets started out with radical intentions but quickly became
                    anti-revolutionary and reactionary. The author of the Lake Poet School who
                    receives the severest treatment is Robert Southey. Brandes begins with a
                    characterization of his early years as “free-minded” (Brandes 1875a:141), but
                    this freethinking is silenced, not the least because he accepts the position of
                    Poet Laureate, which meant that he had been retained to compose “poems of
                    adulation” for the royal house (Brandes 1875a:51). The year 1822 is a turning
                    point, in which Byron through his biting satire <em>The Vision of Judgement</em>
                    came forth before the public eye, delivering a “divine counter parade” to
                    Southey’s servile poetry (Brandes 1875a:149). Southey was an obvious victim of
                    Brandes’ critique of poets for hire who serve the elite. When he remarks that
                    Southey was “reduced to living by his pen and thus necessarily wrote too much,”
                    his judgement is not far from that of the reception of the poet following his
                    death. Around 1900, for example, the famous English critic Leslie Stephen spoke
                    positively of Southey’s character, but criticized him for being too mechanical
                    in his poesy, which meant that his works were possessed of neither profound
                    reflection nor much artistic merit (Stephen 1902:45-85).</p>
                <p> Among the older generation of writers in the volume, it is Walter Scott who
                    achieved the widest commercial success, and he alone acquired his renown through
                    prose writing. His novels were translated into most European languages, in
                    Germany translations were made in virtual “translation factories.” In Denmark
                    Scott’s novels were published as competing translations, and they were reissued
                    numerous times. <em>Naturalism in England</em> is wedged between two bursts of
                    Scott novels in Danish translation, the first from 1855-71 and the second in the
                    1880s (Eriksen 1976:108-12). Yet Brandes writes at a time when Scott’s
                    reputation as a serious writer was in decline. His popularity had made him the
                    property of the masses, and in tune with writers of serious literature turning
                    their backs on Romanticism and embracing realism, Scott’s novels were viewed as
                    at best suitable for cheap entertainment. Brandes is clearly supportive of this
                    development, yet it is Scott’s conservatism that he finds most alienating. Scott
                    wrote historical novels that perhaps well enough addressed the violent religious
                    and political conflicts that had marked Scotland’s past, but the sequence of the
                    events focus on reconciliation and mark out a road toward the peaceful present.
                    Scott’s support for the contemporary government, Church and the union between
                    Scotland and England appealed to the broad readership and the conservative
                    critics.</p>
                <p> Yet such glorification of the political status quo is in conflict with Brandes’
                    ideal of literature as polemic: Scott had “still not, in the religious,
                    political and poetic senses, reached the point of emancipating the personality
                    from the peculiar traditions that hold it captive from birth.” Thus, his novels
                    succumb to the Brandesian “law” according to which that which is not
                    controversial in its own time inevitably will come across as “trivial and
                    narrow-minded” to the next generation. Since Scott’s stories invoke universal
                    “jubilance” rather than rebellious reflection, he must therefore leave for the
                    “younger generation of poets an unresolved, yet from the historical perspective
                    clearly defined task” (Brandes 1875a:190-1). Brandes thus does not regard
                    Scott’s immense popularity and his many imitators as something that moved
                    culture forward in either Denmark or Europe. In <em>Emigrant Literature</em>
                    Brandes attacks B.S. Ingemann’s historical novels, which he designates as
                    belonging to “an unsuccessful and now renounced genre imported from Scotland,
                    the historical novel, which was instigated by a full-blooded Tory emanated from
                    an intellectual state that found all its ideals in the past, just like ours”
                    (Brandes 1875a:22). Brandes’ irritation at the popularity of the historical
                    novel evidently stretches farther back than <em>Main Currents</em>, for already
                    in October 1867 he had made his acceptance of a dinner invitation from the
                    author Rinna Hauch conditional upon a promise that Scott would not be discussed
                    (Fenger 1955:308).</p>
                <p>English-language Romantic poets have traditionally been grouped into a canon of
                    “the big six”: Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Shelley, Byron, and William Blake.
                    This canon (which has come under significant pressure in the 21st century) is
                    for all practical purposes the same as is found in Brandes, with the exception
                    of the English poet and painter William Blake (1757-1827). This is hardly
                    surprising, for despite the increased attention devoted to Blake’s authorship in
                    his homeland and through the second half of the 19th century, he was as an
                    author seen as peripheral until the early 20th century, when his authorship was
                    canonized. The first Danish translation of Blake appeared in 1897 (three nature
                    poems), and a sustained critical interest in him first began to manifest in
                    Denmark in the 1930s (Rix 2018). It would have been interesting to see how
                    Blake’s lifelong radicalism would have shaken up Brandes’ distinction between
                    the first and second generations of poets, since Blake debuted before Wordsworth
                    and outlived Keats, Shelley, and Byron. Yet it is likely that Brandes (parallel
                    with his analysis of Shelley) would have found Blake’s prophetic style too
                    ethereal and his poetry too unknown to play any larger role in <em>Naturalism in
                        England</em>.</p>
                <p>In Brandes’ view, it is John Keats (1795-1821) who is first among the younger
                    generation to lead the way forward toward what will become Byron’s revolt
                    against petite bourgeois values. Yet it no easy matter for Brandes to fit Keats
                    into his historical scheme, since his poetry is “l’art pour l’art” (Brandes
                    1875a:22) and a special kind of “pure art” that delivers sense impressions
                    almost devoid of meaning. Keats died young, for which reason Brandes is unable
                    to say in what direction his politics would have evolved had this “world shy
                    child” reached manhood (Brandes 1875a:220-2). Yet Brandes does mention Keats’
                    embittered poem “To Hope” as well as his relationship with English radical
                    circles, including the journal editor and radical Leigh Hunt (Brandes
                    1875a:220). In Brandes’ era, Keats’ political and social engagement was only
                    rarely touched on and would only much later receive real critical attention, as
                    in for example Marilyn Butler’s landmark <em>Romantics, Rebels and
                        Reactionaries</em> (1981) and Jack Siler’s <em>Poetic Language and Political
                        Engagement in the Poetry of Keats</em> (2008). </p>
                <p>The next poet in the chronology is the Irishman Thomas Moore (1779-1852), who is
                    not read much today but whose works awakened some interest in Denmark. Several
                    of his poems were translated to Danish (see Eriksen 1976:146-7). Brandes
                    presents Moore as a political poet, indeed the first to “lead English poetry,
                    then recumbent in the contemplation of nature, into the camp of freedom, thereby
                    signaling the poetry of political engagement” (Brandes 1875a:227). This provides
                    Brandes with the opportunity to begin the chapter with a long description of how
                    English domination oppresses Ireland, especially with respect to the execution
                    of the rebels in 1803 (Brandes 1875a:224-8). This digression distracts from the
                    literary focus, but is justified by Brandes in that “it furnishes an idea of the
                    impressions received by Moore during the years when he was ripening into
                    manhood” (Brandes 1875a:233). In this context it is interesting to note that
                    Brandes indicates his intention to work against the grain of current historical
                    accounts of the Rebellion and its suppression. Thus, a note indicates that his
                    account of the events “is founded upon descriptions given by English patriots”
                    (Brandes 1875a:228). This assertion of a critical approach to the source
                    material ought to be taken with a grain of salt. The historical work Brandes
                    cites here is William Nathaniel Massey’s <em>A History of England under George
                        III</em> (4 vols., 1855-63), a moderate liberal interpretation of the period
                    with little sympathy for the King’s politics.</p>
                <p>Under the chapter heading “Republican Humanism” Brandes provides space for the
                    poet Walter Savage Landor (1775-1864), the works of whom Brandes had become
                    acquainted with through his contact with Edmund Gosse (Brandes 1875a:292 note).
                    Landor is portrayed in <em>Naturalism in England</em> as a “friend and
                    intellectual soulmate of the great European revolutionaries” (Brandes
                    1875a:294). In the same manner that the critic esteems Byron, Landor is praised
                    for building a bridge between poetry and political activism, as Landor travelled
                    to Spain to fight against Napoleon in 1808 (Brandes 1875a:23,284). Yet Brandes
                    finds Landor’s poetry stodgy. His Latin vocabulary clearly falls outside the
                    smooth and immediate style Brandes points to as a persistent and positive trait
                    in the writings of the other Naturalist poets of the era. For Brandes Naturalism
                    is synonymous with an anti-elitist orientation and a universal accessibility in
                    the poetry that does not require knowledge of the classical tradition that the
                    privileged classes so often go on about. Landor’s most well-known poem, the
                    heroic-orientalist <em>Gebir</em> (1798), is described as “stiff and inferior”
                    in spite of its “powerful republicanism.” Thus Landor is not the poet who can
                    “bring about a freethinking rupture in European public opinion” (Brandes
                    1875a:298-9).</p>

                <h2>f. Shelley</h2>
                <p>Another politically engaged poet for whom Brandes provides more space is Percy
                    Bysshe Shelley (1792-1822). Brandes had already held up Shelley’s ideals of
                    freedom and vision of love as a positive contrast to the German poetry and
                    philosophy addressed in <em>The Romantic School in Germany</em> (Brandes
                    1873:121-2, 124-5, 239-40, 244). Shelley was a literary acquaintance who went
                    back many years. The Royal Library’s records show that Brandes borrowed The
                    Poetical Works in 1864 (Fenger 1955:118), after he had read a biography of the
                    poet in <em>Fædrelandet</em>. In this context he notes that Shelley’s “unreal
                    life” had made a “powerful impression” on him (Dagbog 17.9.1861:100). In
                        <em>Naturalism in England</em> Brandes also emphasizes the resistance
                    Shelley encountered in his life in the form of censorship and legal
                    prosectution. In this way Shelley is made a supporter of Brandes’ idea that
                    engaged art is born in opposition: Shelley’s fearless radicalism and atheism
                    mandates that his “political poetry is written in his blood” (Brandes
                    1875a:335). </p>
                <p>All through the 19th century there was a split between those critics who saw
                    Shelley as a dedicated political poet and those who viewed him as a lyrical
                    dreamer (Morton 2006:36). Brandes sees both possibilities. He notes in his
                    travel essay “Impressions of London” that “Shelley is the brightest, finest
                    expression of English freethinking, and for freethinking especially in the areas
                    in which the English otherwise are typically unfree,” and yet at the same time
                    he is also “the expression of pure lyricism” (Brandes 1896:307). Shelley’s
                    lyrical grace is held up time and again in <em>Naturalism in England</em>, yet
                    Brandes never lets his political side out of sight. In an acute formulation
                    Brandes writes that Shelley’s poetry had “greater and more varied significance
                    for the spirit of human emancipation than anything written in France in August
                    of 1792 [when the monarchy was abolished]” (Brandes 1875a:302). It is his
                    admixture of revolutionary spirit and lyrical virtuosity that is attractive to
                    Brandes, and as the reader gradually begins to comprehend, Shelley functions as
                    the very ideal of poetic art that Brandes seeks to define in <em>Naturalism in
                        England</em>.</p>
                <p>According to Brandes, Shelley sensually and passionately seeks in nature a refuge
                    from the world of human beings. Brandes reads Shelley’s poetic treatments of
                    nature’s movements, destruction and rebirth to a large measure as metaphors of
                    social and cultural renewal. Shelley sees nature through his “world dominating
                    imagination” or with “the eye of his soul,” thus elevating it into a stomping
                    ground for Greek mythological figures such as Prometheus and Jupiter (Brandes
                    1875a:326-7). The Danish critic Aage Kabell has found just such a reading to be
                    incompatible with Brandes’ own idea of Naturalism in the period. It is “a bad
                    joke,” he writes, when Brandes praises the eye-witness accounts and scientific
                    nature of Naturalism other places in the volume and yet insists on incorporating
                    Shelley, who hardly at all delivers “any precise study” of the immediate
                    physical world (Kabell 1944:204-5). Yet despite Kabell’s objection it is not
                    difficult to see how Shelley must be included in order that Brandes’ continuous
                    narrative of Naturalism as a progressive, freedom-seeking movement can reach its
                    conclusion. Shelley’s poetry was in fact a direct source of inspiration to Byron
                    – a connection that had already been underlined in Grimur Thomsen’s 1845 Danish
                    biography of Byron, to which Brandes also refers (Brandes 1875a:432 note).</p>
                <p>For Brandes, Shelley is not just a unique talent (as he also finds Moore to be),
                    but “a genius . . . with all the powers of such” (Brandes 1875a:354). The
                    presentation of Shelley as an <em>enfant terrible</em>, the untimely genius who
                    cannot find a place in the prosaic world, introduces a familiar mythical
                    construction of Romanticism to the analysis. Yet the fact that the ideals of
                    this genius are ethereal and otherworldly is also Shelley’s weak point. Brandes
                    for example describes <em>Revolt of Islam</em> as being “imprecise and vague,
                    abstract and metaphysical” (Brandes 1875a:355), thus lacking in social impact.
                    If Shelley had played a noble violin, says Brandes, a trumpet was needed to
                    provide the “call to arms” against Europe’s intellectual tyranny (Brandes
                    1875a:356).</p>

            <div>
                <h2>g. Byron</h2>
                <p>As many critics have noted, the great cultural narrative with Byron as its finale
                    resembles the presentation of the German critic Georg Gottfried Gervinus
                    (1805-71). Byron is inserted into history as a catalyst for the renewal of the
                    revolutionary spirit, or as Gervinus describes it (in a contemporary Danish
                    translation), it was believed that “the excesses of the revolutionary spirit”
                    had been halted forever, since it suddenly seemed to happen that “American
                    republicanism, German freethinking, French revolutionary enthusiasm, and
                    Anglo-Saxon radicalism” had all been brought to life in this single intellect
                    [Byron]” (cited in Elze 1876:449).</p>
                <p>Byron’s mature poetry is inscribed in Brandes’ literary-historical narrative as
                    “The Culmination of Naturalism” (the title of the last chapter of the volume).
                    In the writings of the mature Byron one finds a trinity of characteristics,
                    according to Brandes, for which the highest form of poetry ought to aim: the
                    realistic portrayal of things, the perfection of aesthetic form. and an active
                    political vision in the direction of human emancipation (see Kristensen
                    1980:17). Revolutionary poetry comes into form in <em>Manfred</em> and is
                    sharpened in <em>Cain</em>, but it is not until <em>Don Juan</em> (the great,
                    incomplete opus magnum) that Byron is “completely himself” (Brandes 1875a:503).
                    Brandes believes that it is Byron’s earthbound style that paves the way for his
                    immense influence. In his later study of the British reformer Benjamin Disraeli
                    (who was prime minister twice in 1868 and 1874-80), Brandes notes of the
                    statesman’s revolt against his hidebound homeland that “Disraeli believed that
                    Byron was an intellect on the same level as himself; Shelley was too ethereal”
                    (Brandes 1878b:165).</p>
                <p> That Byron was the epitome of rebelliousness was also asserted by British
                    critics in Brandes’ own time, including Matthew Arnold, W.E. Henley, and A.C.
                    Swinburne (see Rutherford 1995). Yet there is a difference between how
                    positively Byron’s literary achievements were received in Britain and on the
                    continent. Brandes quite correctly notes that Byron was not buried in the poet’s
                    corner of Westminster Abbey (a memorial stone was not erected until 1969). Yet
                    his poetry had taken root in “the intellectual life of Russia and Poland, Spain
                    and Italy, France and Germany” (Brandes 1875a:524). Byron’s participation in the
                    Greek War of Independence and his struggle on behalf of oppressed nations
                    resonated across Europe. For Brandes, Byron is a signal tower rising above the
                    national. Whereas Wordsworth, Moore and Scott had each given their respective
                    lands a national song, Byron’s focus on the “I” brought forth a newer and deeper
                    understanding: “Byron’s I is the universally human, (and) its sorrows and hopes
                    those of all humanity” (Brandes 1875a:432). Many years later Brandes writes that
                    “Byron’s poetry [illustrates] the despair and the desire for freedom common to
                    all Europe,” and further notes that he is a decisive influence on Slavic
                    literature, since its brightest lights, Poland’s Adam Mickiewicz and Russia’s
                    Alexander Pushkin, both began as Byronians (Brandes 1888:203,49).</p>
                <p>Byron’s poetry was debated assiduously in Denmark, yet as Brandes observes the
                    reception was often cool and, according to him, the meaning often misunderstood.
                    His old enemy Hans Lassen Martensen had in his <em>Christian Ethics</em> (1871)
                    argued that Byron was the exponent of a pessimism that rendered impossible “the
                    realization” of the “ideal of freedom” and the “consolidation of true progress.”
                    Brandes cites this attack (Brandes 1875a:433) as a starting point for a lengthy
                    revision of this common interpretation. His reading of Byron comes off as more
                    in harmony with the Italian patriot and writer Giuseppe Mazzini (1805-72), who
                    in a famous 1839 essay had declared Byron to be the author who would lead Europe
                    forward toward political freedom and democracy (Mazzini 1970).</p>
                <p>Byron had been translated into Danish numerous times, making it possible for
                    contemporary Danish readers to assess Brandes’ readings against the primary
                    texts. Knud Lyne Rahbek translated Byron as early as 1817, while the first
                    Danish translation of one of Byron’s major works was <em>Manfred</em> in 1820.
                    Simultaneous with <em>Naturalism in England</em>, Edward Lembeke’s two-volume
                        <em>Selected Dramatic Poems and Stories</em> (1873-76) was published. Byron
                    was viewed as a subjective poet, hence Brandes devoted much ink to excerpting
                    from Byron biography. The chief references for Brandes’ presentation are the
                    well-known works on Byron’s life: Thomas Moore’s <em>The Life of Lord Byron</em>
                    (1835), Grimur Thomsen’s university thesis <em>On Lord Byron</em> (1845) and the
                    Halle professor Kristian Elze’s great German monograph <em>Lord Byron</em>
                    (1870), later published in Danish translation by Kristian Kroman in 1876. The
                    biographies paint a picture of an apostle whose alternative lifestyle and ideas
                    upset the sanctimonious self-satisfaction of the bourgeoisie. Brandes views the
                    agonies suffered by Byron at the hand of establishment England as mirrored in
                    the sufferings endured by the heroes of his poetry. This supports the connection
                    between life and work that is postulated in <em>Naturalism in England</em>.
                    Brandes writes about Byron both as writer and as celebrity. With respect to the
                    latter, interest in Byron’s escapades and public scandals was widespread in the
                    European press. Already in 1815 a Danish newspaper commented on Byron’s private
                    life, and parts of Thomas Moore’s <em>Letters and Journals of Byron</em> were
                    published in Danish journals (Nielsen 2003:366).</p>
                <p>Byron was by no means a new acquaintance for Brandes. We know that he read
                    Manfred in 1860 (in Lembeke’s 1843 translation), commenting on that occasion
                    that he finds the final scene “absurdly ingenious” (Fenger 1955:11). Thereafter
                    he read <em>Sardanapalus</em>, <em>Heaven and Earth</em>, <em>The Two
                        Foscari</em>, and <em>Beppo</em>, but in the Byron chapter it is primarily
                        <em>Childe Harold</em>, <em>Manfred</em>, <em>Cain</em>, and <em>Don
                        Juan</em> (in C.V.A. Strandberg’s translation) that are addressed in depth.
                    It is these latter poems, with their focus on the individual and singular hero
                    and his world encompassing agonies, that make possible Brandes’ thesis of the
                    defiant subject’s emancipation from norms. Byron stands out as the incarnation
                    of that which becomes a modern figure in literature, an archetype that Thure
                    Stenström (1961) has identified as the “solitary one.” This positive reading of
                    Byron’s subjectivity is in contrast to the charges of egotism that have often
                    been registered against Byron. Taine, for example, views Byron as so
                    self-centered that he was incapable of falling in love with another (Taine
                    1863:540). This was a critique that Danish critics had expressed earlier, for
                    example Adam Oehlenschläger, who spoke of Byron’s “monotonous proud egotism”
                    (Oehlenschläger 1833:109), and Johan Ludvig Heiberg, who held that Byron had
                    allowed himself to be ensnared “within the web of his own dialectic” and thus
                    could not “reach the unity” that the idealistic poet ought to (Heiberg 1833:43).
                    For Brandes, it is Byron’s courage to embrace the subjective – the “I” that
                    frees itself from the yoke of tradition – that constitutes his genuinely heroic
                    achievement. </p>

            <h1>4. Reception and Afterlife</h1>
            <div>
                <h2>a. Editions and Changes</h2>
                <p>The second edition of <em>Naturalism in England</em> bears the publication year
                    of 1892, but in fact came out in April 1893. Many small changes were made, among
                    others the addition of new sections on Keats’ letters to his beloved Fanny
                    Brawne. These were first made public in 1878 and thus not included in the
                    original edition. Also added was a longer section on the Scottish-born poet
                    Thomas Campbell (1777-1844), who is best known for his long poem <em>The
                        Pleasures of Hope</em>, in which he reflects on political themes such as the
                    French Revolution, the partition of Poland and slavery. Yet even though Brandes
                    refers to Campbell as a political poet, he is most assiduously cited in the
                    chapter on “Erotic Lyricism.”</p>
                <p>Perhaps most noteworthy is the supplementary material on Shelley now included.
                    Most important is that the introductory citation of the volume, which in the
                    first edition had been from Johann Peter Hebel’s writing, is now exchanged with
                    a citation from Shelley’s notebook poems: “I am as spirit.” This indicates that
                    Brandes’ interest in Shelley remained ardent and even seems to have grown. In
                    the book <em>Impressions from Poland</em> Brandes comments, quite significantly,
                    that few had paid much attention to Shelley “while the name of Byron was on
                    everyone’s lips.” This is stated in order to point, in his eyes, to an injustice
                    he goes on to describe as “the general belief in all seriousness that Byron was
                    England’s greatest lyricist” (Brandes 1888:201). This is most of all a comment
                    directed against the technical virtuosity of Byron measured up against that of
                    Shelley. Yet in the context of the 1892 German edition of <em>Main
                    Currents</em>, Brandes composes a poem in which he comments on <em>Naturalism in
                        England</em> in this manner: “In faith and blood red zeal it was written. /
                    Shelley! Its spirit belongs to you. You I have lived” (cited in Brandes
                    1908:284). This upgrading of Shelley’s significance does not cohere with the
                    actual content of the first edition of the volume, which undeniably stands under
                    the sign of Byron (see Nolin 1965: 198). Further documentation of Brandes’
                    reevaluation of Shelley in relation to Byron is found in his <em>Memoirs</em>,
                    in which Brandes reflects on how, in spite of his respect for Byron, “it was at
                    that time Shelley who moved me, through the unselfish rebelliousness of his
                    being against every contemptible rule in custom as in dogmas, that
                    rebelliousness in irreducible unity with the purest poetry” (1908:383). </p>
                <p>The third edition was published as a volume in his <em>Collected Works</em>
                    (1900). There are few changes in comparison to the second edition. New
                    bibliographic references are added, and Brandes includes a reference to
                    Shelley’s “Song. Sorrow.” One of the changes worth noting is that many of the
                    English citations are now translated to Danish verse (in the first edition the
                    preference was for prose reproductions). This change received a mixed reception.
                    Adolf Hansen comments specifically on a translation of Keats, asserting that
                    Brandes just about “mutilates” the meaning with his erroneous translation
                    (Hansen 1876:25-6). Otto Jespersen, the world-renowned grammarian, who took a
                    special interest in the English language, praises the new renderings (Jespersen
                    1912:94), noting only a single exception that he finds unsuccessful. Much later,
                    Aage Kabell suggests that the translations are often brilliant, but other places
                    lack metrical sensibility (Kabell 1944:191-3).</p>
                <p> The fourth edition from 1906 is identical to the third edition.</p>
                <p>The fifth edition was published in 1924. With respect to the content it was more
                    comprehensively revised, especially the Byron material. Otto Jespersen has
                    suggested that already in the fourth edition Brandes had come to look more
                    unsentimentally at Byron’s private life and “the lack of conscience in his
                    behavior” (Jespersen 1912:91). This is taken a step further in the fifth
                    edition. Many of the women are now discussed, which means that Byron’s love life
                    and gender ethics are given greater emphasis; among other changes, a few pages
                    are added on his incestuous relationship with Augusta Leigh. Brandes is perhaps
                    reacting to the complaints that he had painted too ennobled a portrait of Byron.
                    There is also more material on the poet’s time in Switzerland and Venice. That
                    the biographical material is expanded is commensurate with reception on the
                    1920s, in which critical treatments focused more on the life of the poet and his
                    morality than the poetry (Stabler 2013:1-3). One change of a certain
                    significance here is that many citations are now in the original language;
                    especially with respect to verse lines from Shelley’s works.</p>
                <p>The sixth edition from 1967 is a reproduction of the fifth edition but with
                    modernized orthography, and the Danish translations of the poems are
                    reinserted.</p>

                <h2>b. Danish Reception </h2>
                <p> That the publication of <em>Naturalism in England</em> did not receive much
                    attention in the Danish press is surely enough a consequence of the fact Brandes
                    was seen as persona non grata by the Copenhagen media, still dominated by
                    national liberal ideas. Yet there were reviews in <em>Morgenposten</em> and
                        <em>Lolland-Falsters Stiftstidende</em>, both of which had connections to
                    Brandes.</p>
                <p>Only a week before <em>Naturalism in England</em> appeared, Brandes published a
                    translation of the literary realist Gottfried Keller’s <em>Swiss Stories</em>,
                    which were regarded as daring and risqué. The reaction to what was interpreted
                    as a commercial venture for Brandes may have functioned as a lightning rod for
                    the polemic <em>Naturalism in England</em> might have provoked. In Carl Ploug’s
                    review of <em>Swiss Stories</em> in <em>Fædrelandet</em> (Nov 20, 1875), Brandes
                    is called a “literary businessman” who preaches “<em>the gospel of
                    pleasure</em>” and contributes to the degeneration of youth; Vilhelm Topsøe
                    accused him in <em>Dagbladet</em> of introducing the Danish reader to erotic
                    scenes that would take root because of their “impurity and corruption” (Dec 13,
                    1875); and <em>Dags-Telegrafen</em> (Nov 21, 1875) published a sarcastic review
                    which bemoaned Brandes’ decision to translate so base a work (cited in Friis
                    1965:59-61 and Knudsen 2008:137-8).</p>
                <p>The lack of press reviews of <em>Naturalism in England</em> is to a certain
                    degree made up for by the critic Adolf Hansen, who published in pamphlet form a
                    49-page review of the volume in 1876. In this review Brandes is praised for his
                    profound insight into British literature, not least for his clear descriptions
                    of Scott’s and Wordsworth’s contrasting views on nature. Even though it is
                    evident that Brandes confers the poetic laurels on Byron and Shelley at the
                    expense of Wordsworth, Hansen devotes much space to persuading the reader that
                    Brandes actually views Wordsworth’s works positively; these were after all
                    generally viewed as the masterpieces of the period. This was evidently important
                    in order to avoid that Brandes should be accused of lacking critical
                    intelligence. Hansen’s review functions most of all as kind of defense of
                    Brandes in the Danish debate over him, and thus further concludes with an
                    expression of anger that he had not been given the professorship that was his
                    due. Even though Hansen disagrees with some of the details, his general praise
                    of <em>Naturalism in England</em> is unaffected, for Hansen maintains that
                    Brandes’ criticism is correct in its broad outlines and his observations
                    accurate.</p>

                <h2>c. The English-Speaking World</h2>
                <p>Brandes was known abroad for among other things his readings of European authors,
                    his support for Nietzsche and for having introduced Scandinavian literature,
                    especially Henrik Ibsen, to the English-speaking public (see Waller 2008:322-3).
                    But most of all it was his three-volume study of Shakespeare (1895-6, ENG 1898)
                    that made his name in the Anglophone world and paved the way for the translation
                    of <em>Main Currents</em>. The volume on <em>Naturalism in England</em> came out
                    in English during the first half of 1905 (New York, Macmillan Co.; London, W.
                    Heinemann) and was a translation of the second edition. Yet already when the
                    Danish edition was issued a review was published in the well-known London
                    journal <em>The Spectator</em>. The review primarily consists of a summary of
                    Brandes’ main points as well as excerpts of his descriptions of Scott and Byron,
                    here translated into English. The reviewer begins by calling Brandes “one of the
                    most eloquent and enlightened of modern critics,” and even though the volume
                    contains much that is generally known, the judgement nonetheless is positive:
                    “his knowledge and accuracy are surprising, and . . . – except misprints of
                    English words, which are too common – there is hardly any misstatement of fact
                    upon which we have been able to lay our hand” (<em>Spectator</em> 1876:17).</p>
                <p>When the English translation appeared the journalist and author Elia W. Peattie
                    wrote an equally positive review in the <em>Chicago Daily Tribune</em>, which
                    gives the impression that Brandes was already a known quantity: “never was
                    Brandes more delightful. What gossip – what knowledge – what comparison – what
                    deductions” (Peattie 1905:9). Peattie sees Brandes’ commentaries as a refreshing
                    alternative to English-language criticism; it directs its attention toward the
                    abstract as if it were music or pictorial art, whereas the Dane according to his
                    nature demonstrates a protestant preoccupation with the morality and an emphasis
                    on the good and the orderly in the literature. Yet not everyone esteemed
                    Brandes’ radical freethinking when it came to the evaluation of English
                    literature. Walter Raleigh, professor of literature at Oxford, thus writes in a
                    1905 private letter: “There’s nothing in Brandes; he’s just a Continental Jew
                    culture-monger. He doesn’t know what poetry is. Keen about his sawdusty creed,
                    namely rationalism, progress, enlightenment – all perfectly abstract” (cited in
                    Waller 2008:323).</p>
                <p>Both in Denmark and abroad the tendency among later critics is to comment on
                    Brandes’ quite heavy-handed evaluation of the British poets. In a festschrift
                    for Brandes, Otto Jespersen notes that while Brandes had perhaps taken sides in
                    the volume, his “partisan judgement had only in exceptional cases damaged the
                    presentation and never resulted in a distorted or stunted image of the
                    personalities of the authors” (Jespersen 1912:87). Jespersen thinks that Brandes
                    is perhaps hard on “a great poet like Wordsworth” but that Southey’s “lack of
                    talent” receives its proper treatment, and that “this occurs in the most
                    enjoyable manner and the finest form” (Jespersen 1912:88). Others were not so
                    convinced of Brandes’ powers of judgement. It was especially his affection for
                    Byron at the expense of Wordsworth that occasioned commentary. The politician
                    and later Minister for Irish Affairs Augustine Birrell appreciates Brandes’
                    “hearty, honest delight in Byron’s beauty and daring and rank and reckless wit”
                    (Birrell 1916:211), yet contends that Brandes is unjust in placing him above
                    Wordsworth. The Norwegian-American critic Hjalmar Hjorth Boyesen had already
                    contributed an even more skeptical position. The lionization of Byron’s
                    rebellion against the authorities is cause for special concern: “Dr. Brandes has
                    so profound an admiration for the man who dares to rebel that he fails to do
                    justice to the motives of society in protecting itself against him” (Boyesen
                    1895:205). The English literary critic George Saintsbury writes in the same vein
                    on the hundredth anniversary of Byron’s death: Brandes was wrong about Byron and
                    never managed to understand how destructive an influence the poet had been on
                    the morality of his homeland” (Saintsbury 1924:50-1).</p>
                <p>In Scandinavia, it was especially the analysis of the atheist and freethinker
                    Shelley that drew attention. The Norwegian bishop Johan Christian Heuch
                    thundered against Brandes’ attack on Christianity (which he saw as a part of a
                    Jewish plot). The assertion is that Brandes promotes Shelley for his
                    anti-Christian attitudes rather than for his poetry (Heuch 1877:67-72). Brandes’
                    quite out of hand dismissal of Southey further rubbed the author, nationalist
                    and anti-Semite Harald Nielsen the wrong way. In an essay he refutes Brandes’
                    critique of the English poet, concluding with a castigation of <em>Naturalism in
                        England</em>, which he argues does not deserve to be viewed as literary
                    criticism because of “his cock and bull characteristics, his flagrant
                    absurdities and psychological self-contradictions” (Nielsen 1922:83). Nielsen
                    was the center of a “new youth movement” whose goal was to create an alternative
                    to Brandes’ radical understanding of culture.</p>
                <p>Brandes’ politically motivated attempt to revise the British canon provoked sharp
                    commentary throughout the 19th century. His quite severe and personal critique
                    of Wordsworth incited Aage Kabell to call his treatment of him “a masterpiece of
                    perfidy” (Kabell 1944:205). Kabell also questions the use of biographical data
                    in the context of Shelley’s flight from England. He argues that Brandes
                    overplays the role of the social persecution of the poet, when there were other
                    reasons for his journey to Italy, such as his miserable health (1944:189).
                    Further skepticism of Brandes’ powers of judgement is to be found in the
                    tone-setting literary critic René Wellek, who in his <em>A History of Modern
                        Criticism</em> argues that <em>Naturalism in England</em> provides “a
                    completely distorted picture” of the early 19th-century poets (Wellek 1968
                    [1955]:360). That on which other critics are in agreement is not appreciated by
                    Brandes: Wordsworth’s merits are undervalued, Coleridge as a philosopher is
                    practically never mentioned, Moore receives more attention than Keats and so on.
                    Another misstep is that the impact of Byron is presented as the beginning of a
                    new era, which at any rate in a literary historical sense is not the case
                    (Wellek 1968 [1955]:360-1). Brandes’ fulsome praise of Byron has also motivated
                    the Swedish critic Gunnar Ahlström to point out a contradiction: how can Brandes
                    praise the individualism of Byron when he had condemned precisely the same among
                    the German Romantics? (Ahlström 1937:97). Yet Thure Stenström argues that
                    Brandes, when addressing Byron, establishes a separate and more action-oriented
                    ideal of individualism than the empty reveries upon which the Germans fall back
                    (Stenström 1961:99ff).</p>
                <p>As mentioned above, Edmund Gosse believed that Brandes saw something of himself
                    in Shelley. Later critics have read the portrait of Byron with its focus on the
                    persecuted loner as a mirroring of Brandes’ own position in Denmark at the time
                        <em>Naturalism in England</em> was written. Paul V. Rudow also offers a
                    biographical interpretation of the material, referring to the analysis of Byron
                    as an example of Brandes’ “characterization of the poets in which he mirrors
                    himself, so that the critic and his object are blended together” (Rubow
                    1934:634). A similarly biographical observation is offered by Jørgen Knudsen,
                    who writes that a more fully formed image of Byron – as a poseur defined by
                    ennui – is underplayed by Brandes because it was evidently too uncomfortably
                    close to the traits he could recognize in himself (Knudsen 1985:388-90).</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>d. Influence and Afterlife</h2>
                <p>One reason why <em>Naturalism in England</em> has had a relatively meager impact
                    is because the book does not really bring anything decisively new to the
                    treatments of the individual authors in relation to the existing
                    English-language criticism. René thus formulates his status abroad: “the
                    oblivion which has overtaken him is deserved, as he was only a middleman without
                    originality and substance” (Wellek 1968 [1955]:357).</p>
                <p>A less agreeable consequence of making use of the ideas of others is accusations
                    of plagiarism. Already in 1876 Brandes was accused of borrowing from Elze’s
                    Byron biography in “the sloppiest manner,” such that for example he reproduces a
                    translation error when he does not check the original text against Elze (“S”
                    1876:3). Aage Kabell (1944:206-9) demonstrates that Brandes plagiarizes from
                    William Michael Rossetti’s essay “A Memoir of Shelley” (1870).</p>
                <p>If from the perspective abroad <em>Naturalism in England</em> lacks originality,
                    then it is also such that the book can be said to have been important for the
                    reception of British literature in Scandinavia. In connection with Edward
                    Lembeke’s Danish translation of Thomas Moore’s great frame story
                        <em>Lalla-Rookh: An Oriental Romance</em> (1878), for example, a reviewer
                    refers to Brandes’ reading of the text as an analogy to the subjection of
                    Ireland – a reading with which incidentally the reviewer (writing under the
                    pseudonym “B”) is in disagreement (“B” 1878:2-3). Yet it is especially Brandes’
                    interest in the rebel poets Shelley and Byron that can be traced in his
                    successors. An interest for the relatively unknown Shelley like that of Brandes
                    can be observed in the Danish critics Karl Gjellerup and Valdemar Rørdam, Viktor
                    Rydberg in Sweden, and Herman WIldenvey in Norway (Engelberg 2008:159-60).</p>
                <p> Under the influence of Brandes, Adolf Hansen published translations of Shelley’s
                    poetry in <em>Poems Translated from English</em> (1884) and provided a version
                    of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> (1892), and he also translated Byron’s <em>Childe
                        Harold’s Pilgrimage</em> under the title <em>Junker Harold’s
                        Pilgrimsfart</em> (1880). In his grand English and <em>North American
                        Literary History in Outline</em>, Hansen follows closely Brandes’ analysis
                    of Byron as the active poet who stood “alone against scorn and hatred, held his
                    head high, recklessly spoke what he saw as the truth, and made his words into
                    action” (Hansen 1902:139).</p>
                <p>Alfred Ipsen, an English language teacher, published Byron’s poems
                        <em>Manfred</em> (1888) and Beppo (1891) in Danish translation. Since he
                    originally gravitated toward Brandes’ revolt against Christianity, it is natural
                    to assume that his interest in Byron was influenced by the analysis of
                        <em>Cain</em> in <em>Naturalism in England</em>. Yet later Ipsen turned away
                    from Brandes when he rediscovered his Christian faith. In one of his attacks on
                    Brandes, he describes how the portrait of Byron as well as several others in the
                    volume on British authors are consciously distorted and selective in order to
                    “underpin precisely those facets and characteristics of their personalities and
                    production that cohere with the tendency and plan of the work” (Ipsen 1902:103).
                    Brandes’ good friend Holger Drachmann (1846-1908) achieved his literary
                    breakthrough with a volume of poems dedicated to Brandes, <em>Poems</em> (1872),
                    in which many of the verses express an interest in England’s revolutionary
                    movements. This is particularly evident in “English Socialists,” in which he
                    hopes that England will take lessons from the revolutionary Paris Commune.
                    Drachmann also translated Byron’s <em>Don Juan</em> into ottava rima (published
                    in eight parts in 1890-1 and as complete edition in 1902). Brandes has also
                    perhaps inspired August Strindberg to read Byron’s <em>Manfred</em> (see Nielsen
                    2004:384), and it has been suggested that the concept of the superman in the
                    Swedish poet Gustaf Fröding (1860-1911) can be traced back to Brandes’
                    interpretation of Byron (Sjöholm 1940:188ff).</p>
                <p>Brandes suggests in <em>Naturalism in England</em> that the poet Frederik
                    Paludan-Müller wrote “imitations” of Byron’s Beppo (Brandes 1875a:468) at the
                    beginning of his career. This was, however. denied by the author in a reader
                    letter published in the Brandes-edited journal <em>Det Nittende
                    Aarhundrede</em>. Paludan-Müller protests that he had not read Byron’s poem
                    (Paludan-Müller 1876:471-3). Brandes published an apology in response, yet at
                    the same time argued that influence can be something indirect that exerts itself
                    as something intangible through “the poetic atmosphere of the age” (Brandes
                    1876:474).</p>
                <p>The German edition of <em>Naturalism in England</em>, which was reissued many
                    times, played a certain role in discussions of 19th-century British literature
                    in non-English-speaking countries. It is for example referenced by the literary
                    historians Carl Bleibtreu (1887) and Ika A. Thomése (1923), but is also taken up
                    as late as 1963 by the Slavicist Karel Krejöi. In conclusion it should also be
                    noted that Brandes has had an influence in China, not least in the wake of the
                    translation of his book on Shakespeare in 1935 (see Jensen 1980:233-4). Yet
                    before that translation, Brandes made an impact on the productive translator of
                    Western literature and later Chinese communist leader Zhang Wentian (1900-76),
                    who nourished a profound fascination with Shelley and Byron. On the occasion of
                    the hundredth anniversary of Byron’s death (1924), he translated a chapter on
                    Byron from Brandes’ <em>Naturalism in England</em> to Chinese (see Gamsa
                    2010:22). A translation of the whole book by Han Shih-heng (from the English
                    edition) followed in 1939, together with the first three volumes of <em>Main
                        Currents</em>. The key word “Naturalism” was again taken up in the 1950s by
                    the literary critic Li Zhichang in his essay “Naturalism in Chinese Literature,”
                    which concerns a literary wave in China that had gathered inspiration from
                    Japanese models. In this context, Brandes’ conceptual apparatus and his
                    treatment of British authors are referenced (see Shotung 2002:299). In this way,
                    Brandes seems to have set forth certain foundational principles in the love of
                    nature that resounded in the understanding of literary movements outside the
                    immediate circle of poets he wrote about.</p>

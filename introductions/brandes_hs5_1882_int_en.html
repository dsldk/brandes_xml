            <p>Georg Brandes’ <em>The Romantic School in France</em>, the penultimate volume of
                    <em>Main Currents</em> in <em>Nineteenth Century Literature</em>, appeared in
                Copenhagen in 1882. </p>
            <p>It is a “cheerful” volume, in which much of the work is driven by enthusiasm for both
                French Romanticism and for its own methodology. At the same time, it is
                characterized by the wealth of learning exhibited, acquired through many years of
                reading, in contrast to the first volume, <em>Emigrant Literature</em>, which also
                treated French literature but was based on a small handful of novels and a good
                measure of polemical ideas. The fifth volume is on the contrary less polemical,
                which is reflected in the praiseful (and less critical) reception. The volume also
                distinguishes itself in other ways. There is, for example, no real central figure
                like Byron or Heine as in the corresponding volumes on the English and German
                schools. Even though the writings and person of Victor Hugo form a natural focal
                point in the French Romantic School, he does not receive his own chapter in the
                book. Most importantly, Brandes seems to have developed, or was in the process of
                developing, a new understanding of the central concept of all six volumes: the “main
                current.”</p>
            <p>The following presents the process of composition of the volume, after which its
                contents are discussed. Georg Brandes’ presentation of the ideas and aesthetics of
                the French Romantics centers on three characteristics to which the reader versed in
                French Romanticism will nod in recognition. Brandes combines them in a new manner so
                that they are in conflict with one another rather than serving as organizational
                components of a Romantic program. Thereafter Brandes’ argumentation shall be
                analyzed with special focus on a distinguishing feature of the volume, the admixture
                of on the one hand a detail-heavy and sober, yet hardly arid literary
                historiography, and on the other, a successful metaphorics. Finally, the literary
                historical “methodology” shall be discussed in relation to a series of contemporary
                French literary historians who resemble Brandes, or at any rate are analogous to
                him, in their experiments with otherwise time-honored literary historical categories
                such as work, author, causality, the spirit of the age, nation etc.</p>

                <h2>a. Brandes in Berlin and Paris</h2>
                <p>The fifth volume of <em>Main Currents</em>, <em>The Romantic School in
                        France</em>, came out in 1882 as a kind of final portrait of the French
                    Romantic movement with which Brandes for a long time had been occupied. During
                    his stay in Paris in 1866-7 he had read Victor Hugo, Alfred de Musset and George
                    Sand, and before the publication of the first volume of <em>Main Currents</em>
                    in 1872 he had already written on Prosper Mérimée and Charles Augustin
                    Sainte-Beuve. In the fall of 1871 he had planned to lecture in Copenhagen on
                    French drama with emphasis on French Romanticism, an idea that ultimately was
                    changed to the lectures on emigrant literature which became the first volume of
                        <em>Main Currents</em>.</p>
                <p>During the brief and productive period between 1872 and 1875, Brandes managed to
                    publish the first four volumes of <em>Main Currents</em>, after which fully
                    seven years would pass before the fifth volume appeared. The reasons for this
                    pause are many. In the first place, certain biographical circumstances
                    intervened. These years are appropriately designated as his “period of exile,”
                    for he travelled much, especially to Germany, where he settled in 1877. He
                    managed to hold three lectures on French Romanticism in Copenhagen in September
                    1877; after a farewell celebration he left for Germany in October, where he
                    remained the next five years. This self-imposed exile is distinguished by an
                    extraordinarily immense production of lectures, articles and no less than four
                    biographies: Søren Kierkegaard and Ferdinand Lassalle in 1877, Esias Tegnér and
                    Benjamin Disraeli in 1878.</p>
                <p> In 1879 Brandes took a kind of research trip to Paris, consequentially
                    delivering eight lectures on French Romanticism in Copenhagen in November. In
                    1880 he gave lectures on the subject in Berlin as well as Christiania (Oslo) and
                    Bergen, publishing some of these at the time in reworked versions. In a
                    September 8, 1879 letter to his mother, Brandes describes how rather remarkably,
                    in the midst of all this productivity, he found himself unable to write (Brandes
                    1994, 1:249).</p>
                <p>This leads to the second reason for the long gestation period of <em>The Romantic
                        School in France</em>. Brandes lectured and wrote on French Romanticism in
                    diverse contexts, but could not gather his collected material into a monograph,
                    because according to his biographer Jørgen Knudsen he “continuously and
                    tirelessly added to the growing stable of manuscripts” (Knudsen 1988:199).</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>b. Personalities and Schools</h2>
                <p>There could be a methodological reason for this blockage, namely that Brandes is
                    preoccupied with two factors that cannot easily be reconciled. The author’s
                    biography is for him a wholly necessary element in the understanding of literary
                    works. This is attested by the publication of the four previously mentioned
                    biographies in 1877 and 1878, especially so with respect to the important
                    episodes and psychological phases in the life of Søren Kierkegaard; Jørgen
                    Knudsen thus notes in this context that “here in the fifth volume of the work
                    Brandes has reached the point in his own development at which the biographical
                    is truly essential as the key to the poetic work, and this creates problems he
                    is unable to resolve” (Knudsen 1988:201). This problem involves how his interest
                    in the biographical, which has acquired the status of a methodological
                    conviction, should be related concretely to another and evidently equally
                    pressing methodological question, that is the literary sociological question of
                    the formation of schools.</p>
                <p>There is nothing new in the fact that Brandes during this period was preoccupied
                    with literary schools; the second volume of <em>Main Currents</em>, after all,
                    was titled <em>The Romantic School in Germany</em>, while the fourth was named
                        <em>Naturalism in England: Byron and his Group</em>. Yet the idea of a
                    German Romantic School in the second volume was quite vague in comparison to
                    Brandes’ conception of a school in 1880. Likewise, the designation of a
                    “Naturalist group” in England seems almost disingenuous in the sense that it is
                    to such a high degree bound up with a single person, George Gordon Byron, who
                    sits atop the hierarchy and consumes fully one half of the volume, just as
                    Heinrich Heine takes up half of the last volume of <em>Main Currents</em>,
                        <em>Young Germany</em>. </p>
                <p>There are signs that in the course of working on <em>The Romantic School in
                        France</em>, Brandes was in the process of rehabilitating the idea of
                    literary schools. This impulse came in part from the French material, which to a
                    lesser extent was dominated by a single figure like Heine in Germany or Byron in
                    England. Victor Hugo is important, but it is clear in Brandes’ account in
                        <em>The Romantic School in France</em> that he does not play the same role
                    as the two forenamed, nor that of which he would later attribute to Goethe. This
                    interest in reevaluating the idea of the literary school can also be seen in
                        <em>The Men of the Modern Breakthrough</em> of 1883, which was conceived and
                    written at the same time as <em>The Romantic School in France</em>. Here Brandes
                    writes: “it has been my attention to characterize a larger group of men who here
                    in Norden have promulgated and furthered the modern literary movement” (Brandes
                    1883:[v]). But it is a group without a leader (Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, Henrik
                    Ibsen, J.P. Jacobsen, Holger Drachmann, Edvard Brandes, Sophus Schandorph and
                    Erik Skram), a collection of Scandinavians who formed a school only by virtue of
                    having felt the same impulse to import and to disseminate the modern literary
                    movement from abroad. Moreover, Brandes writes in the introduction that the aim
                    of the book is to communicate to young people the particular literary
                    “constellation” under which they were born (Brandes 1883:[v]). </p>
                <p>A final reason for this concern with the formation of schools could incidentally
                    be that in the various Romantic schools, Brandes saw something of his own role
                    as a central figure in his own movement, particularly the resultant exposure he
                    had experienced. He was in many ways a father figure, thereby exposed to the
                    less savory side of the group dynamic; just as his own group had formed itself
                    spontaneously like the French school had, it was also, in 1882, in many ways in
                    the same state of dissolution he describes in the Romantic school: “and there
                    was, moreover, a certain amount of weariness and discouragement in the new camp
                    after the first great intellectual effort. The combatants were young; they had
                    fancied that one mighty onslaught would be sufficient to capture the
                    fortifications of prejudice; and it was with a feeling of disappointment that
                    they found themselves after the attack still only at the foot of the redoubt,
                    with their numbers greatly reduced. They lost patience and ardor for the fight”
                    (Brandes 1882:144-5). Such a description is not far off from the circumstances
                    of his own group in the year 1882. </p>
                <p>Furthermore, Brandes speaks in <em>The Romantic School in France</em> of “a
                    psychological motive of a nobler nature that contributed to the dissolution of
                    the group, namely the writers’ sense of independence” (Brandes 1882:145), which
                    leads back to the question of the biographical. Brandes fought to hold his group
                    together, but his strategy changed. At times he was tyrannical; an author (Karl
                    Gjellerup) should be held by the ears, he writes in a letter; other times he
                    released his grip: “NB – we permitted the individualities within our camp to
                    develop themselves completely freely. Only in this way does each do his best
                    work,” he writes in another letter to V. Pingel (Georg og Edvard Brandes 1940,
                    3:344). Of his concern for groups and schools at this time, Brandes notes how
                    the Germans, whose contemporary literature in his estimation was nothing
                    special, compensated their lacks with “modern” Russians and Scandinavians: “no
                    literary schools,” he noted in 1882 (cited in Knudsen 1988:291).</p>
                <p>There are thus a good many reasons that it took a long time to prepare and write
                    this volume. The process was, all in all, painful for Brandes: “November 24th.
                    After a dreadful night – without effect I took four measures of potassium
                    bromide and drank more than half a flask of port without getting more than three
                    hours sleep –, a day of exhaustion (Dagbog, 24.11.1882).</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>c. A Positive Current</h2>
                <p>Nevertheless, the fifth volume is remarkably uplifting. Against the background of
                    the previous volumes in Brandes’ <em>Main Currents</em>, which had possessed a
                    critical and at times spiteful tone toward the literary reactions to the French
                    Revolution and the emergence of the new Europe, <em>The Romantic School in
                        France</em> is marked by the flame of enthusiasm. That flame is the result
                    of the appearance around 1830 of a particular generation of authors, pictorial
                    artists, sculptors and composers which, almost unaware, gathered together and
                    united around the will to criticize the political and social situation in
                    France. In his conclusion, Brandes goes through what the Romantic authors had
                    each individually contributed:</p>
                <blockquote>In every one of these domains the generation of 1830 has produced
                    imperishable works. The French Romantic school may therefore, without
                    exaggeration, be called the greatest literary school of the nineteenth century.
                    (Brandes 1882:593).</blockquote>
                <p>Thus the book’s charting of the most important main current of European
                    literature comes across as uplifting, precisely because it demonstrates that the
                    French school was a current in the dynamic sense of the word, a current that
                    left lasting and productive traces in that it split into new rivers that later
                    would gather in the revolutions of 1848. The opposite of this positive reading
                    of the concept of reaction is the current that “stagnates,” which according to
                    Brandes is the case with Danish literature as it is presented in the first
                    volume of <em>Main Currents</em>, <em>Emigrant Literature</em>: </p>
                <blockquote>A true, appropriate, correcting reaction is progress. But such a
                    reaction is powerful and short-lived and does not stagnate . . . When a stick
                    has been bent in one direction, one straightens it out by bending it in the
                    other direction—but one does not keep doing this. (Brandes
                    1872:12).</blockquote>
                <p>This is what happened in Denmark: whereas the revolutionary currents in the major
                    European literatures first were dammed up but later broke through the dykes that
                    had been erected, the Danes, according to Brandes, still worked to keep the
                    revolution in the “swamp of Reaction” (Brandes 1872:14). As has been noted, it
                    was different with the generation of 1830.</p>

            <h1 id="school">3. <em>The Romantic School in France</em></h1>
            <div>
                <h2>a. Framework and Selection</h2>
                <p>Overall, <em>The Romantic School in France</em> is organized into two sections of
                    unequal length. The first part lays out the different political, literary and
                    artistic preconditions, the French as well as the European, of the French
                    Romantic school. First Brandes describes the internal political situation during
                    the restoration of the monarchy between 1815 and 1830. Thereafter, in the
                    chapters “The Generation of 1830” and “Romanticism,” he relates how the Romantic
                    authors quickly formed a kind of brotherhood that reacted with a critical
                    attitude toward the reinstitution of the monarchy and its bourgeois traits. Here
                    Brandes describes how the Romantics also rejected political reality in a kind of
                    self-imposed exile. The principal characteristics of the school are then
                    illuminated. He asserts that the French Romantics wanted to represent reality,
                    both its political and psychological dimensions, in all its complexity and
                    natural contradictions, rather than draw out its truest or most pleasing sides
                    as morally worthy. Brandes further contends that the Romantic school has a
                    talent for the supernatural, and that this can be observed among virtually all
                    the involved authors, from Charles Nodier to Victor Hugo to Honoré de Balzac.
                    Finally, Brandes maintains that the French Romantic school is in a stylistic
                    sense not Romantic, but classical, since the authors subscribe to stylistic
                    ideas that can be traced back to the 17th century. </p>
                <p>These ideas form the internal lines of the book’s second section, the longest,
                    which consists of a series of portraits with equal weight placed on biography
                    and works. The author Charles Nodier is deemed the pioneer of the Romantics and
                    is presented as the writer who introduced the fantastic and the gothic to
                    literature, while the poet Andres Chénier is also identified as a pathbreaker,
                    in so far as his poetry is Romantic in content but composed according to
                    classical ideals. Thereafter follow portraits of the most important members of
                    the school. The titles of the chapters, characteristically, are the names of the
                    authors rather than literary themes or ideas, which had been the norm in earlier
                    volumes of <em>Main Currents</em>, as for example in the chapters on “British
                    Freethinking” or “Republican Humanism” in <em>Naturalism in England</em>. Each
                    chapter is laid out biographically, with details on upbringing, education,
                    travels, and romantic life, and further contains a description of the respective
                    author’s temperament. Only after this does Brandes go over to describing
                    selected works.</p>
                <p> Another characteristic of these chapters is that they are subdivided. First he
                    describes how Victor Hugo found success with his poems and how his theatrical
                    works were banned, but he also relates how a young man of nineteen years visits
                    him at home and shows him a selection of wholly modern poems. This is Alfred de
                    Musset, whose youthful work forms the center of the second half of the chapter.
                    Thus the portrait of Hugo slides into a portrait of Musset. Something
                    corresponding occurs several times: the Musset portrait is shared with a
                    portrait of George Sand, Henri Beyle (Stendhal) is paired with Prosper Mérimée,
                    who is coupled with Théophile Gautier. This is a means for Brandes to uphold his
                    two intentions: to describe both a school and a series of an author’s
                    individually determined works.</p>
                <p>There is no doubt that Brandes has covered all the most important authors of the
                    period, and that they are treated in detail. There are chapters on Musset, Sand,
                    Balzac, Beyle, Mérimée, Gautier and Sainte-Beuve, and there are partial chapters
                    in which two or more authors are compared internally. Finally, there are
                    chapters on the Romantic drama and on Sainte-Beuve and literary criticism.
                    Compared to contemporary literary histories, this selection of authors fits
                    relatively well. But a selection it is, and it is only in the conclusion that
                    Brandes explains himself regarding this: “as a rule, I have only been able to
                    present the typical main figures in relief” (Brandes 1882:590). Continuing, he
                    notes that “there are however in the generation of 1830 two groups of authors, a
                    small one that has written for the whole world, and a larger one that has
                    written for France, and it is only the first group that I have wanted to depict
                    in its full light” (Brandes 1882:591). The first of the selection criteria
                    requires the selection of “typical main figures,” but typical of what? They must
                    be typical of the Romantic school, which explains why an otherwise tone setting
                    author like Alphonse de Lamartine does not receive his own chapter. His
                        <em>Méditations poétiques</em> of 1820 was a colossal success and was widely
                    viewed as the beginning of Romanticism in France because of its dominate poetic
                    I and its personal and often melancholic landscape of feeling. In the meantime,
                    however, Lamartine entered into the French Academy in 1829, and in 1833 the
                    National Assembly. This political activity does not fit into Brandes’ image of
                    the Romantic school as a rejection of the political world, which is why
                    Lamartine is presented as an author who was drowned out by the emergence and
                    triumph of Andre Chénier’s poetry. The absence of Alexandre Dumas the Elder’s
                    historical novels is also noticeable, which likewise can be explained with
                    reference to certain, according to Brandes, atypical characteristics in his
                    literary production: rapidly written historical works for the masses with
                    financial reward rather than participation in the Romantic program as the final
                    goal. Thus in one place Brandes refers to Dumas’ authorship as “literary
                    industry” (Brandes 1882:25). That Gérard de Nerval and Eugène Sue are not
                    treated can however rather be attributed to their anchoring in the local, such
                    that they do not meet the otherwise slightly unclear demand of “writing for the
                    whole world.”</p>
                <p> Regarding Brandes’ selection of authors, one can ultimately dwell on the fact
                    that only one woman, George Sand, is presented in <em>The Romantic School in
                        France</em>. Marceline Desbordes-Valmore published <em>Elégies et poésies
                        nouvelles</em>, <em>Poésies inédites</em> and <em>Les Pleurs</em> to great
                    success in respectively 1825, 1830 and 1833, that is in the middle of the period
                    on which Brandes’ book focuses. Louise Colet, who was closely associated with
                    both Alfred de Musset and Gustave Flaubert, published the poetry collection
                        <em>Fleurs du Midi</em> in 1836, and Delphine Girardin, so central to the
                    Romantic milieu, also published <em>Poésies</em> in 1836. None of them receive
                    independent treatment, just as Flora Tristan’s <em>Pérégrinations d’une
                        paria</em> from 1838 is not named. Brandes can only confess that “the
                    period’s great female figure, George Sand, must stand as the representative for
                    the women of the age, however entertaining it would have been to portray many of
                    the others, the spiritual Madame de Girardin, the elegiac Madame
                    Desbordes-Valmore, or the two free living authoresses Madame d’Agoult and Madame
                    Allart” (Brandes 1882:590). That Brandes refers to treatment of them as
                    “entertaining” could be an expression of a derogatory attitude toward the
                    literary production of women. Thus Brandes also says that “. . . nearly every
                    one of George Sand’s novels bares the mark of one or another manly influence . .
                    . Again and again she makes herself the organ of the ideas of others” (Brandes
                    1882:29). In any case it is clear that what applied to Lamartine also applies to
                    these women: by virtue of their (gendered) political engagement they do not fit
                    into Brandes’ idea of French Romanticism as a school that rejects political
                    reality, the bourgeoisie, capitalism and working life. Brandes sees them as
                    spiritual and free living, but not as what they also were, namely at one the
                    same time politically engaged and a part of the Romantic school.</p>
                <p> Comprehensiveness was not Brandes’ working principle. He had a great deal of
                    material with which to work in <em>The Romantic School in France</em>, and as
                    noted he waits until the end to address his sins of omission. Brandes’ work on
                    the volume is marked by another interest, namely his eye for how a school, in a
                    short time and against the background of a miserable political situation,
                    emerges as an exuberant fellowship and yet relatively quickly dissolves into
                    individual careers. Between the two parts of the work we can already sense one
                    of the methodological tensions in Brandes’ project: the relationship between, on
                    the one side, historical determinism and its consequentially impersonal
                    metaphorics of currents, movements, fields of force, and on the other, Brandes’
                    biographical orientation with detailed portraits of a comprehensive series of
                    authors’ upraising, life and genius. </p>
                <p> In the following, Brandes’ account of the political background of French
                    Romanticism shall be presented. Here there will be special focus on how the
                    Romantic school overcomes the reactionary political, religious and economic
                    forces that dominated the country in 1830. Thereafter, Brandes’ form of
                    argumentation shall be analyzed, as his style, metaphorics and pathos also play
                    an important role in his argument for the Romantic school as a “proper”
                    reaction. Finally, certain literary historiographic perspectives shall be
                    identified, as Brandes’ work can be compared to current experimental versions of
                    French literary historical writing.</p>

                <h2>b. The Political Situation in France around 1830</h2>
                <p>The point of departure for Brandes’ literary historical tableau is fundamentally
                    political. In his conclusion he notes that “we have seen how the Restoration and
                    the <em>Juste milieu</em> regime formed the historic background from which
                    Romanticism projected itself, and without which it cannot be understood”
                    (Brandes 1882:591). He singles out the years 1825-35 as the period in which
                    French literature reacted to the political situation, which was relatively
                    complex. Brandes, who was of course historically closer to the events, thus
                    provides a kind of insider perspective; a more comprehensive account is
                    therefore necessary.</p>
                <p>After the Empire of Napoleon I (1804-15), France returned to monarchy in 1815,
                    which lasted until 1830. This period, the Restoration, is generally divided into
                    two sub-periods, Brandes included. The first ran from 1815 to 1824, with the
                    relatively reconciliatory, or at any rate prudent, Louis XVIII as king. Upon his
                    death in 1824, Charles X ascended the throne, pursuing in contrast an
                    ultra-royalist and quite repressive political program of tightening laws and
                    censorship as well as compensation for the returned nobility; in general, he
                    sought to return France to the absolute monarchy that had been abolished by the
                    Revolution of 1789. After six years of this very Catholic and anti-democratic
                    regime and various gratuitous changes in key governmental posts, the July
                    Revolution followed in 1830. In the French context this is called <em>Les Trois
                        Glorieuses</em>. In contrast to the great revolution of 1789, which properly
                    understood lasted ten years and was only concluded with Napoleon’s coup d’état
                    in 1799, the 1830 revolution played out over only three days in late July. Over
                    and beyond the dearth of bloodletting, the hasty conclusion of this revolution
                    meant that the republican forces, paradoxically enough, were not organized
                    enough to enact the change in regime they desperately desired. </p>
                <p>This development was employed by moderate royalist forces (among them the
                    journalist Adolphe Thiers, who in 1871 would become president of the Third
                    Republic) to install Duke Louis Phillipe, who was not of Bourbon stock but of
                    Orleans, as king. Louis Phillipe, who had participated in the revolution of 1789
                    on the side of the rebels, and who in the 1830s was called the “Bourgeois King,”
                    instituted reforms, but rather quickly lost his popularity. Brandes refers to
                    him as the “Umbrella King,” painting a portrait of a monarch whose good sense
                    and efforts to ingratiate himself with the people was necessary enough as a
                    beginning. Contemporary Frenchmen, especially Parisians, however, viewed this
                    “hunt for popularity” (Brandes 1882:12) as disgraceful, as self-abasing petite
                    bourgeois sniveling. </p>
                <p>Under this pseudo-royal order French society was divided. The court stepped back,
                    thus vanishing in a series of hitherto prominent cultural patterns of behavior,
                    while the banking and financial worlds, governed by new and less noble social
                    practices and ways of life, took over power. It was no longer traditional
                    values, but capital and industry that governed the interests of the ruling
                    class. At the same the cultivated portion of the upper bourgeois, which earlier
                    had held salons for artists and intellectuals, attempted to be gentrified into a
                    new nobility. According to the artists all of this was shameful, irritating and
                    mediocre, nothing other than a <em>juste milieu</em> kingdom, a society of
                    drabness. Brandes concludes:</p>
                <blockquote> Little wonder that the umbrella soon became the symbol of this
                    monarchy, and the expression <em>Juste-milieu</em> — which the King had once
                    cleverly used in speaking of the policy that ought to be employed — became the
                    nickname for everything weak and inefficient, for a power without luster and
                    dignity. (Brandes 1882:14).</blockquote>

            <div>
                <h2>c. Literary History Between Main Current and Historical Electrical Field</h2>
                <p>Brandes’ diagnosis of reaction is interesting on the level of argumentation. He
                    notes how “art for art’s sake” becomes the watchword of the age: “during the
                    Revolution the youth worshipped freedom, under Napoleon the glory of war, now
                    they sanctified art” (Brandes 1882:16-17). With the political events of 1830 and
                    the financial bourgeoisie’s seizure of power, art becomes the watchword of
                    youth. When Brandes asserts that art is a reaction against the hypocritical and
                    money grubbing bourgeois society, he notes that it is no longer about formal
                    rule-boundedness and symmetry or idealized content. Art means the presentation
                    of the natural, the sensual, the lucid, the passionate. The artist orients
                    himself against existence and movement and has contempt for sensible rules of
                    style and poetological principles.</p>
                <p>That Brandes’ argumentation in this critical part of the work is interesting is,
                    on closer inspection, due to the seemingly objective description rather than a
                    stylistic dramatization of an historically thrilling situation: “all the
                    conditions were present in combination which were certain to impel, with
                        <em>force</em>, young and restless minds towards romantic intoxication . .
                    .”; “<em>enthusiasm</em> for liberty in art”; “art was the highest,” “its
                    natural antipathy to utilitarianism and plutocracy managed to compel in the
                    intellectual <em>current</em> . . . a <em>turning</em> in the direction of
                    antagonism to everything existing and accepted, and at the same time mightily
                    increased the <em>force</em> of the current” (Brandes 1882:15); “a
                        <em>movement</em> within the mind had begun that recalled the Renaissance”
                    (Brandes 1882:18). This state of affairs is asserted by Brandes as a fact, but
                    without providing any actual examples in support of it. That this is so could
                    presumably be attributed to the fact that Brandes’ interests lie elsewhere than
                    in demonstrating his assertions through evidence. He is less interested in
                    documenting the literary historical causal relations than in characterizing the
                    concept that already figures in the title, which is introduced at the beginning
                    as something that is of concern to him during this period: the Romantic
                        <em>school</em>. </p>
                <p>The traits that occupy Brandes are located less in the diachronic perspective,
                    which incidentally figure prominently later in the work, than in a
                    characterization of the selected decade as a dynamic continuum. The terms
                    Brandes employs in determining the emergence of the Romantic school reveal this
                    clearly: “movement,” “force that compels,” “restless,” “turning,” “force,”
                    “current.” There is thus here much more a sense of a field dominated and
                    animated by physical forces than a historically determined reaction to previous
                    events. This is wholly the central idea in Brandes’ larger project on reaction,
                    which has now received a supplement: this group of author’s interests and ideas
                    are well enough a reaction to a political situation, but the reaction also
                    overcomes its initial negativity, in so far as it takes place upon an electrical
                    field that is perceived to be common to all:</p>
                <blockquote> Their meeting is electric; they exchange ideas with youthful haste,
                    impart to each other their hatreds, their sympathies and antipathies, and all
                    these well-springs of feeling flow together like the streams that form a river.
                    (Brandes 1882:22) </blockquote>
                <p>The recurrent river metaphor is supplemented here with a metaphorics that makes
                    it prudent to conceive of Brandes’ chosen decade as an electromagnetic field.
                    Such designates how electrically charged particles, in this case the authors’
                    and artists’ “hatreds” and “sympathies,” are impacted by the force of the field,
                    and how the movement of these particles in turn impact the field. It is decisive
                    for Brandes that the Romantics are united in opposition against the money mad
                    bourgeoisie, yet their unity comes from a common movement, an electrical force,
                    rather than clear ideas or a Romantic program. It is electricity, currents,
                    exchange rather than ideas and thoughts. Brandes points numerous times to Hugo’s
                    preface to his drama <em>Cromwell</em> as a critical text for the school, yet he
                    also notes that it is not entirely clear to the members of the Romantic school,
                    indeed even to Hugo himself, what these pages actually say:</p>
                <blockquote>They may be only half true, they may be vague, but they have this
                    remarkable quality that, in spite of more or less indefiniteness, they affront
                    all traditional prejudices and wound the vanity of the day where it is most
                    vulnerable, whilst they ring in the ears of the young generation like a call,
                    like a new, audacious watchword . . . So it happens that first one man, then
                    another, then a third, comes to be a spokesman of the new tendency, each with
                    his own standpoint, his own past, his own revolt, his ambition, his need, his
                    hope, his resolve. (Brandes 1882:21-2)</blockquote>
                <p> Victor Hugo’s unclear yet seductive prose pages function, to carry on the
                    metaphor, more like an electric coil that conducts the electrical field. As
                    Brandes emphasizes in the citation, it is crucial that the charges of the
                    Romantic electrical field outwardly speaking are critical and spiteful, but
                    inwardly the field is fundamentally ethical. Thus after 1830 the mere reaction
                    to a political disappointment is overcome by a positive ethics held in common:
                    admiration for that which is worthy, which provides meaning for the electricity,
                    the forces, the current. Brandes repeatedly notes that the distinguishing mark
                    of the school is the immeasurable regard of its members for each other, the
                    security of a brotherhood that provides the field with its power of cohesion. An
                    example of this is that the authors share the feeling of being outside of
                    society as authors, not because they have yet to write themselves into social
                    status, but more because they can in no manner understand themselves to be a
                    part of the new financial bourgeois society. Such a reaction seems to them
                    wholly natural, and thus self-imposed exile necessary, yet it is in their
                    meeting and in their common feeling of this necessity that their reaction leads
                    to the formation of a school. According to Brandes, it is the experience of this
                    shared fate that transforms the Romantic school from being negatively oriented
                    and merely reactionary circle to a self-reinforcing and centrifugal electric
                    force in the literary and political landscape.</p>

                <h2>d. Three Main Ideas of the Romantic School</h2>
                <p>That such a fellowship – which had first been a reaction against petite bourgeois
                    values, capitalism and a normative understanding of art – could emerge and
                    consequently produce important literature is the result of another circumstance.
                    This electromagnetic field consists, as previously mentioned, of all possible
                    kinds of artists – writers, musicians, pictorial artists, composers, and critics
                    --, but they did not possess a common program. They found one another and worked
                    together out of a will to break with society and to rebel, and their
                    self-understanding was rooted in an idea that being an outcast is an essential
                    part of being an artist. They were neither creatures of the court (as Racine and
                    Molière had been in the 17th century) nor of the world (as with Voltaire and
                    Diderot in the 18th century), but rather shut out from the start. One would
                    rather not curry favor with the public’s miserable taste and preconceived ideas.
                    Brandes notes that the artists of the Romantic school would be artists in
                    themselves and no longer follow along with the “surface current” of the age,
                    which consisted of opinion, prejudice and convention. They will allow themselves
                    to be driven by the undercurrent of the age: a “class of urges that had yet to
                    take shape, but were in the air” (Brandes 1882:30). This is the “unifying
                    element in their efforts” (Brandes 1882:30). Once again, Brandes thus
                    characterizes the Romantic school in natural and physical terms: currents,
                    elements, formlessness, air etc. are the conditions for an artistic fellowship
                    out of which in time individual banners shall be distilled.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>e. Literary Contrasts</h2>
                <p>It becomes wholly clear that the school’s desire for solidarity comes before the
                    ideas when Brandes takes up the task of recounting what actually crystallizes in
                    and through this school. Brandes identifies three characteristics of the
                    Romantic school, of which the first acts programmatically, while the second and
                    third act to annul the first. The first, which stems from Victor Hugo, involves
                    a new definition of the content of literature. Literature should integrate
                    contradictions and no longer portray types. It should no longer be built up on
                    the plausible and the credible, but on the true and the natural. In his famous
                    preface, Hugo says that the real should be called forth from immediate contrasts
                    and contradictions such as beauty/ugliness, virtue/ depravity, good/evil.
                    Literature should not distinguish these in a moral sense and should not identify
                    the good and the beautiful as higher than the wicked and the ugly, but represent
                    them in integrated form: Caesar can thus be nervous that his triumphal carriage
                    will tip over. And the judge can well become so hungry that his sense of justice
                    wavers. Such is the nature of man in reality, and it is as such that literature
                    ought to present it.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>f. The Supernatural</h2>
                <p> Brandes however identifies a characteristic of Romantic literature that <em>de
                        facto</em> detaches its poetics from the naturalistic register. In the first
                    place these contrasts in Romantic literature are exaggerated, and rather more
                    involve the relation between the natural and the supernatural than pinpointing
                    and classifying contrasts in human nature. It is difficult for Romantics to
                    manage prosaic and quotidian contradictions, and Brandes provides a series of
                    persuasive examples of how the they are most interested in presenting the
                    contrasts between the mundane and the supernatural. Texts by Sand, Hugo and
                    Balzac are cited as examples of how the fantastic is an important element as an
                    opposing pole to the miserable reality of 1830.</p>
                <p>A novel that demonstrates this configuration of the supernatural and the
                    fantastic amidst the new social and political reality is <em>Balzac’s La Peau de
                        Chagrin</em> of 1831 (Brandes 1882:245-8). It begins when a young man,
                    Raphäel, who has lost his money gambling, wanders despairingly around the Seine
                    and would drown himself. He absent mindedly enters an antique shop, coming into
                    possession of a magic shagreen that grants all wishes. The price however is that
                    each time a wish is granted, the young man’s life is shortened. The first thing
                    Raphäel wishes for is a sumptuous dinner, and immediately he is met with a
                    series of journalist friends, whom he invites to a grandiose and Dionysian
                    banquet with a wealthy financier. The novel takes place in October 1830, that is
                    several months after the July Revolution, and its young men are thus all marked
                    by the political confusion and disillusion over the “new” regime, while at the
                    same time they enjoy the temptations of the Upper Seine, that is the riches of
                    the city’s actual new center of power. After having lived his life, becoming
                    wealthy and successful in fashionable Paris, Raphäel grows old rapidly,
                    renounces everything, and in a kind of paradox of biological desire, dies of his
                    only remaining wish: the wish to live. The novel exemplifies Brandes’ diagnosis
                    of French Romanticism in how it depicts a quotidian existence against a backdrop
                    of a politically unsatisfying reality that is at the same time governed by a
                    fantastic and supernatural element. </p>

            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>g. The Romantic School and the Classical Style</h2>
                <p>There is something persuasive in Brandes’ analysis of how certain weighty
                    Romantic works go beyond (or forget) the very poetics that otherwise serve as
                    their point of departure. In the meantime, Brandes also identifies another
                    characteristic that acts not to transgress but rather to denaturalize Romantic
                    poetics. This is a characteristic that deserves notice in that it evidently can
                    explain Brandes’ description of the Romantic school as an electrical field. He
                    asserts that the contradictions the Romantics seek out are in reality classical
                    antitheses, and that they maintain these contradictions in strictly classical
                    forms: they are Romantics, but classical in form. In the second part of Goethe’s
                        <em>Faust</em>, for example, the powerful content overflows the form, while
                    among the French classical forms and structures are upheld. Brandes compares
                    Victor Hugo to none other than Pierre Corneille, the chief exponent of the
                    classical drama in France (Brandes 1882:39). While the identification of the
                    supernatural and fantastic element in the literary works is a corrective to the
                    self-understanding of the Romantic school, it is quickly abandoned by Brandes.
                    His point about the stylistic and formal strictness of the Romantics, however,
                    is a characteristic to which he returns again and again from the start to the
                    finish of his review of the authors of the Romantic school. Of Charles Nodier,
                    who together with André Chénier was a source of inspiration for the Romantics,
                    Brandes notes: <blockquote> However eager he was to defend the new tendencies in
                        literature, he remained conservative in the matter of style, expressing the
                        19th century fantastic in the strict and perspicuous style of the 17th.
                        Frenzied in his fancies, he is prudent and clear in his form. (Brandes
                        1882:59). </blockquote>
                </p>
                <p>To Nodier and the other source of inspiration for the school, Chénier, Brandes
                    thus attributes a “chastity of style” and a “sober clarity of presentation.”
                    Together they therefore provided for the school the following stylistic point of
                    departure:</p>
                <blockquote> It was a foundation of this kind on which the new Romantic school would
                    build upon — the noblest simplicity of language, correct drawing, a Grecian
                    rhythm in all the transitions, the beautiful lines of the bas-relief, pure
                    color, and strict form. (Brandes 1882:433) </blockquote>
                <p>Brandes proceeds right from the start to characterize the style and the form of
                    virtually all the Romantics according to this idea of the classical. Of George
                    Sand:</p>
                <blockquote>She is romantic in her enthusiasms, in the way in which she yields her
                    personality unresistingly to her feelings, which defy rules and norms, but she
                    is in a strict sense classical in the rule-boundedness of her periodic
                    structures, the abstract beauty of her forms, and the sobriety of her coloring.
                    (Brandes 1882:206-7) </blockquote>
                <p>Mérimée receives a corresponding characterization:</p>
                <blockquote>Without difficulty it can be said that Mérimée, despite the restraint
                    and strict classicism of his style, is in many respects an outstanding
                    representative of the French Romantic tendency. (Brandes 1882:347).</blockquote>
                <p>Brandes continues: “Mérimée’s restraint and discretion receives its final
                    testimony in the classical and elegant strictness of his style” (Brandes
                    1882:411). Of Stendhal (Brandes uses his birth name Henri Beyle), he says by way
                    of introduction that his intention was that “one ought to be ‘Romantic’ with
                    respect to the ideas, for that is ‘the challenge of the century,’ yet one ought
                    to remain classical in manner of expression, in the form of language and turn of
                    phrase . . . one ought to strive to write like Pascal, Voltaire, La Bruyère”
                    (Brandes 1882:72-3). And Brandes concludes with Stendhal by noting that “it is
                    clear enough that happiness for Beyle consisted of clarity” (Brandes 1882:325).
                    With respect to Théophile Gauthier, Brandes speaks of “the perfection of form
                    and of refinement, the strict purity of rhyming and proportionality of harmony”
                    (Brandes 1882:433).</p>
                <p>Brandes sees this classical quality of style in all the authors with which he is
                    occupied. Moreover, he had bombastically announced as much in his introductory
                    characterization: “all the French Romantics are Classicists. Mérimée is a
                    Classicist, Gautier a Classicist, George Sand a Classicist, even Victor Hugo is
                    a Classicist (Brandes 1882:39). Paul V. Rubow argues that the idea of the
                    Classicism of French Romanticism was already present in Brandes, but it was only
                    after studying German and English Romanticism that he could with certainty
                    ascribe this peculiar stylistic trait to it (Rubow 1932:15-17). This is a
                    valuable insight, yet one can however tie the idea of the Classicism of
                    Romanticism to the description of the literary electrical field noted
                    previously.</p>
                <p>It is striking in itself how stringently Brandes applies the same concept to
                    denote the style of the Romantics: purity, clarity, strictness, symmetry,
                    sobriety. Yet it is still more striking that this characterization, which acts
                    just as apodictically as it does unsupported, seems to be in conflict with what
                    Romantic style is universally regarded to be. Brandes defines this as: “if by
                    Romantic, as is customary, we understand an excess of content over form, content
                    not subordinated to recognizable form . . . then all the French Romantics are
                    Classicists” (Brandes 1882:39).</p>
                <p>From this it can be concluded that within the classical style there is a more
                    determinate relation between content and form, and that form dominates content.
                    More precisely formulated and with a nod to Aristotle, it can be said that the
                    two qualities that should be determinative of the classical style are clarity
                    and deviation. Thus Aristotle writes in his <em>Poetics</em>:</p>
                <blockquote>The perfection of style is to be clear without being mean. The clearest
                    style is that which uses only current or proper words; at the same time it is
                    mean . . . Lofty and elevated is that style which dispenses with all too
                    familiar words and employs rarer ones . . . Yet if one exclusively uses such
                    expressions, the language will be either inscrutable (a riddle) or barbaric . .
                    . One thus ought to employ a mixture. (Aristotle 1999:51-2).</blockquote>
                <p>Aristotle’s qualification of classical style (lexis) is thus double: it should be
                    clear and sharp and at the same time possess something distinctive, a
                    foreignness that distinguishes it from ordinary speech. It can be said that the
                    classical style is itself conscious of the poetic effects of deviation, yet at
                    the same time is also aware that this deviation must not exceed the boundaries
                    of immediate understanding. It is necessary to distance the thought from its
                    customary and trite expression, on the condition that clarity is in equilibrium
                    with the stylistic deviation and, like a stylistic superego, binds it to the
                    thought, whose expression is thereby not “barbaric” or “inscrutable.”</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>h. Style and Field</h2>
                <p>If we now place together Brandes’ designation of the Romantic style in France
                    with Aristotle’s definition of the domain of style via deviation from the
                    coordinates and clarity, a particular perspective thus comes to light. When
                    Brandes constantly characterizes the style of the Romantics as classical through
                    predicates such as clarity, purity, sobriety, symmetry, etc., we should not at
                    all understand this as a demand for a normative style. For Aristotle clarity was
                    a kind of stylistic relay that kept an eye on deviation, which could come
                    forward if the style should become overwrought. In reality, logic dictates that
                    if there is a high degree of clarity, purity and sobriety among the Romantics,
                    then it is perhaps precisely because there is a powerful tendency toward
                    deviation in their works. Or to continue this line of thought, if there is a
                    high degree of tension in Romantic content, then there should also be a highly
                    functioning and proven relay that is on a level with the charges of the
                    field.</p>
                <p>Thus clarity is not just a quality of syntax, word choice, genre, and ideal type.
                    It is operative. It is a purifying and cleansing force that does not impact the
                    historical norms of what literature ought to be. If the Romantic style can in
                    the sense of its obstinateness be said to be the expression of complex
                    emotional, social or political experience, then the clear and pure expression
                    can be understood as a clarification and purification of such complex Romantic
                    experience. Thus there is no invocation of a governing tradition, according to
                    which one must write according to particular rules and respect certain normative
                    demands of style. Stylistic clarity can rather be said to be operative as
                    continuous linguistic clarification and revelation of the emergence of a complex
                    new reality within language.</p>
                <p>Brandes notes how the program of the Romantics was from the beginning not
                    particularly clear, and that it was only after the school dissolved and the
                    individual authors embarked on their independent careers that clear ideas take
                    shape. Thinking in terms of justice, equality, the truth, and politics amidst
                    the new tumultuous reality thus presumed, according to Brandes, that the ideas
                    were guided through the initial powerful tension within the electrical field
                    (affection and admiration), thereafter acquiring form. It is here that clarity
                    as an operative element is important, because it is this – not accordance with
                    the normative – that shall guarantee that the extraction of the new ideas
                    respects the new political reality of the thinking, its empirical conditions of
                    possibility. It is in this manner that the unity between thought and stylization
                    should be clarified, every time the thought of the new shall be extracted from
                    the ideal, secure sphere in and of itself, with point of departure in the new
                    sensibilities, new political conditions, new social practices. Clarity becomes
                    the operative element that guarantees that the confused and emergent ideas of
                    the electrical field are crystallized, continually revealed and purified, so
                    that they can remain faithful to their dynamic nature in their further
                    development within the various careers of the authors. These originally unclear,
                    yet commonly held ideas are the content of the electrical field that Brandes
                    calls the Romantic school, and when he notes that a proper reaction is “short
                    and powerful” in contrast to the Danish “swamp,” it could be asserted the proper
                    form of reaction in France is precisely the form of clarification. The Romantic
                    school identifies a long series of ideas that had yet to become norms or ideals,
                    but which were still coming into being, and it is in the individual Romantic
                    authors’ own careers that they will ultimately be implemented.</p>

            <h1 id="reception">4. Reception and Afterlife</h1>
            <div>
                <h2>a. Local Reception</h2>
                <p>After the intense debate around the lectures and the person of Georg Brandes at
                    the start of the 1870s, over time it became the fate of <em>Main Currents</em>
                    that it did not attract much attention in Denmark. Brandes’ polemical and
                    aggressive, <em>ad hominem</em> style had been noted abroad, but in Denmark it
                    led to a kind of generalized retreat from <em>Main Currents</em>, indeed almost
                    a kind of non-reception regarding its ambition and quality. With the appearance
                    of the <em>Romantic School in France</em> in 1882 this seemed to change. Sophus
                    Schandorph reviews the book quite positively in <em>Ude og Hjemme</em>,
                    remarking that Brandes is longer an “agitator” (Schandorph 1883:197), and in
                        <em>Illustreret Tidende</em> H.S. Vodskov concludes correspondingly: “the
                    transition from polemicist to man of science is in all essence complete”
                    (Vodskov 1882:271). </p>
                <p>The national liberal <em>Dagbladet</em> was also remarkably friendly toward the
                    book (Knudsen 1988:210), as was <em>Sydsvenska Dagbladet Snällposten</em>,
                    published in Malmö, which similarly discussed the work in in its “News from the
                    New School” section, which emphasizes the change in attitude from the previous
                    volumes, for example in the observation that while Brandes is still not free of
                    “fanaticism,” he is however in his basic approach “more mature and more thorough
                    than ever before” (<em>Sydsvenska Dagbladet Snällposten</em> 1883). One gets the
                    sense that his longer stay abroad has rendered Brandes’ need to polemicize
                    against Denmark less pressing, at the same time that now returning home and he
                    is perhaps interested in being received as something else, as a less combative
                    type of critic.</p>

                <h2>b. Reception in France</h2>
                <p>It was Brandes’ grand dream to be acknowledged in France. In an 1888 letter to
                    Georges Noufflard, an art connoisseur, he writes:</p>
                <blockquote>Je lis toujours beaucoup de Français. J’aime votre littérature plus que
                    toute autre. J’ai écrit plus de livres sur la France que sur tout autre pays et
                    pourtant je suis parfaitement inconnu en France. Quand j’avais écrit un seul
                    article sur les Flamands on était prêt à m’ériger des statues en Flandre; tous
                    les poètes m’envoyaient leurs œuvres, tous les journaux parlaient de moi. Quand
                    j’ai écrit deux petits articles sur les écrivains Russes sans même savoir leur
                    langue, on a été tellement touché de mes connaissances qu’on m’a loué, m’a
                    traduit, m’a fait venir. Sur la France j’ai écrit plus de volumes que je n’ai
                    écrit d’articles sur la Russie, et on sait à peine que j’existe. Un certain
                    Charles Simond veut me traduire; depuis deux ans il cherche en vain un éditeur,
                    bien que Paul Bourget m’ait offert d’écrire une introduction. Cela m’attriste un
                    peu, car une réputation n’est pas consacrée aussi longtemps que la France n’a
                    pas dit son mot. (Brandes 1952:131-132) [I constantly read French. I love your
                    literature more than any other. I have written more books about France than any
                    other country, and still I am altogether unknown in France. When I had written a
                    single article on Flemish literature, they were ready to erect a statue of me;
                    all their poets sent me their works, all their newspapers talked about me. When
                    I had written two short articles on Russian poets, without even knowing the
                    language, they were so moved by knowledge of them that I was praised, translated
                    and invited to visit. I have written more books on France than I have articles
                    on Russia, and still the French hardly know I exist. A certain Charles Simond
                    wants to translate me; for two years he has searched in vain for a publisher,
                    even though Paul Bourget has for a long time promised to write an introduction.
                    It irritates me, for the measure of an author has not been established as long
                    as France has withheld its judgement]. </blockquote>
                <p>It was only in 1902 that Brandes’ <em>The Romantic School in France</em> became
                    the sole volume of the six to be translated to French. Moreover, it was
                    translated from a German edition and not the Danish original, and while the
                    introduction is quite laudatory, it is written by the less well known (compared
                    to Paul Bourget) aesthetics professor Victor Basch (Basch 1902). On the other
                    hand, there had been a longer and quite critical reaction to Brandes’ <em>Main
                        Currents</em> in 1893, from the critic Jean Thorel. Thorel begins by
                    asserting that Brandes is a polemicist and a partisan for an anti-religious and
                    anti-clerical party, and that it was this positioning that initially established
                    his success and reputation among the youth of Denmark. Thorel next asserts that
                    Brandes’ <em>Main Currents</em> is hamstrung by his commitment to a doctrine
                    from the Enlightenment. In the first place, there is an internal contradiction
                    between the idea and the main current, and in the second, from the very first
                    pages Brandes limits his corpus to <em>certain</em> central groups and
                        <em>certain</em> significant movements. </p>
                <p>The problem for Thorel is that Brandes’ selection criteria are located in neither
                    the formal determinations of literary genre nor the intellectual historical
                    content, which objectively can be said to have determined the European main
                    currents. The main currents he addresses are those that point forward to 1848,
                    the year of the great European revolutions, which are important in that they
                    contribute to the literary development he traces. But Brandes, according to
                    Thorel, has before beginning defined his project according to the scheme of
                    revolution, reaction, and the overcoming of reaction, which is then filled out
                    with suitable works, without however providing space for works, genres, authors,
                    or ideas that do not fit the scheme. The concept of the main current is thus not
                    just tautological, but also ideological. Brandes, asserts Thorel, had decided
                    ahead of time that those who overcame the reaction could be designated as main
                    currents, such that he presupposes what he shall prove. Brandes had likewise
                    predetermined that this overcoming should point forward to the revolutions of
                    1848, which according to Thorel is an ideological decision and the reason why
                    Brandes, who seeks to be acknowledged as a man of science, should rather be
                    called a polemicist.</p>
                <p>Thorel further criticizes Brandes’ conception of literature as an art form that
                    submits problems to debate, by inquiring as to how we should analyze and
                    interpret those quieter canonical works, <em>les chefs-d’oeuvres</em>, that is
                    those that are not possessed of such urgency yet are still read. Thorel
                    furthermore points out that the drama in six acts that Brandes had announced in
                    the first volume is in fact of faulty construction. His focus on the Revolution
                    of 1789 necessitated that the émigré literature (for example, Chateaubriand and
                    Madame de Staël) come first, followed by German Athenaeum Romanticism. But the
                    revolt against Weimar Classicism in Jena and Berlin as a defined literary period
                    was as such already concluded by the time the French émigrés began to write.
                    Thorel concludes his critique with the following:</p>
                <blockquote>Un avocat ayant une cause à défendre: en résumé, c’est là tout M.
                    Brandes, et c’est ce qui fait, selon nous, tout le vice de son œuvre. Elle n’est
                    qu’un long plaidoyer, confus et indirect, en faveur d’une cause, et d’une cause
                    étrangère à la littérature. M. Brandes a déclaré lui-même qu’il n’a eu en vue,
                    en composant cette histoire dite des principaux courans [sic] de la littérature,
                    que le progrès des idées libérales (Thorel 1893:358) [A lawyer defending a case.
                    That is the whole of Brandes’ work, and in my reckoning my problem with it. It
                    is just a long, grubbing and indirect defense of a case that is alien to
                    literature. Mr. Brandes has himself declared that in his presentation of the
                    so-called main currents of literature, his only concern has been the progress of
                    liberal ideas.] (Thorel 1893 :358)</blockquote>
                <p>That Brandes is a polemicist, or just polemical, is hardly a new assertion. Nor
                    is the assertion that this fifth volume could possibly seem to be “flighty.” We
                    can well acknowledge the majority of Thorel’s objections, but the question
                    remains of what consequences these ought to have for the evaluation of Brandes’
                    work. Thorel seems piqued at Brandes methodological liberties and determines
                    from the start that the work suffers under these to such a degree that it cannot
                    be taken seriously from the scientific perspective.</p>
                <p>If however we view Brandes’ work as what it is, a literary history, then it comes
                    off as quite inspired and “elastic,” as William Barry writes in a 1904 review in
                    the Bookman (Barry 1904:97). It could also be said that it is independent, in
                    the double sense of the word: on the one side autonomous and individually secure
                    in itself, which in the scientific context thus means isolation. Brandes’ work
                    stands on its own, but thereby also stands alone form the perspective of
                    science. That this independence was a problem at the time is understandable and
                    at any rate is attested by Thorel, while from a modern perspective it emerges as
                    something rather interesting. If we are able to follow along, point by point,
                    with certain of Thorel’s objections, then his disqualification of Brandes as
                    literary historian by virtue of his overly independent methodology seems to us
                    old-fashioned. Turned on its head, it could be seen as meaningful in identifying
                    a potential scientific modernism in Brandes’ project.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>c. Experimental Literary History Writing</h2>
                <p>Brandes can be compared to newer and distinctive experiments in French literary
                    historiography. Since around 2000, especially in the Anglo-Saxon academy,
                    efforts have been made to formulate new versions of French literary history,
                    including among others the placing of parentheses around otherwise classical and
                    – one should think – more or less unavoidable categories such as period, style,
                    historical background, and author.</p>
                <p>The first in this series of experimental literary historiographic efforts
                    appeared in 1998, bearing the appropriate title of <em>A New History of French
                        Literature</em> (edited by Denis Hollier). Through a long series of short
                    form chapters (the work counts 165 contributors), the book identifies what could
                    be called “literary events” that are not, on the first go around, recognizable
                    to the reader through overarching categories such as period (for example
                    Classicism, Romanticism, Naturalism), genre (for example novel, tragedy, sonnet)
                    or historical situation (for example political regime). </p>
                <p>The chapters are most often anchored in a date, an unknown person or social
                    historical anecdote that conventional literary history has overlooked. One
                    chapter, which actually involves Voltaire’s dramatic production and aesthetic
                    taste during the Enlightenment, is thus titled: “1759, 23 April. The Duc de
                    Lauragais pays the Théâtre-Francais an Indemnity of 12,000 Livres to Remove
                    Spectators from the Stage.” The chapter concerns how the actor who had played
                    the king in Voltaire’s <em>Sémiramis</em> had stumbled over the privileged
                    spectators who had leave to purchase side seats on the stage, and who had
                    proceeded in the closest quarters (and quite loudly) to express their amusement
                    at what otherwise was a moment of seriousness in the tragedy. The Duke of
                    Lauragais thus paid the theatre to move all these seats for the remainder of the
                    performances, thereby creating a wholly new understanding of the work of art as
                    autonomous fiction, which the new bourgeoisie should observe at a distance and
                    with respectful seriousness. Aside from the surprising yet persuasive
                    connections between unnoticed events and significant new literary forms and
                    ideas, it is interesting that a work – in this case Voltaire’s – is treated in
                    other articles from different points of view (as is also the case with for
                    example Marcel Proust and Surrealism), such that the work or the period emerges
                    as a cross-thematized tension rather than, in light of its unity, being bound up
                    with a priori categories such as authorial intent, time and genre.</p>
                <p> The second example of experimental literary historiography is called <em>French
                        Global. A New Approach to Literary History</em>, edited by the Harvard
                    professors Christie McDonald and Susan Suleiman. Published in 2011, it was
                    informed by the awareness that French literature had come into being not within
                    a geographical and political continuum, a nation, but in the meeting of and
                    exchange with other cultures. French literature is a “literature of
                    interaction,” whose most important works, each in a wholly distinct manner and
                    to varying degrees, were conditioned by meetings and negotiations with other
                    political, geographical, linguistic, ethical and aesthetic conditions, from
                    Montesquieu’s Persians to the Irishman Samuel Beckett, who as is known wrote his
                    works in French, from Pierre Corneille’s <em>Oedipus</em> to contemporary
                    African Francophone authors, from Honoré de Balzac and the conquest of Algeria
                    in 1830 to Gustave Flaubert’s Orientalism and so on. All have, to a high degree
                    and in varying ways, come into being in the encounter with one or another form
                    of cultural “otherness.” This concept does not just allow the identification of
                    a series of exchanges between the French canon and a generalized cultural
                    otherness, it also serves to demonstrate that the porousness of national
                    borders, historically viewed, is both a recurrent and productive characteristic
                    of a literature that otherwise often enough is viewed as both self-sufficient
                    and proud of its national self-understanding. French Global is thus also
                    logically organized into main parts whose titles (<em>Spaces, Mobilities and
                        Multiplicities</em>) are a far cry from the typically temporal and aesthetic
                    literary historiographical categorizations such as genre, style, period, and
                    century.</p>
                <p>These new literary histories, each in its own iconoclastic manner, both surprise
                    and persuade, if the premises with which they are conceived and written are
                    accepted. Both share a clear sense that a de-sacralization of the above
                    mentioned literary historiographical concepts, from organized categories to ad
                    hoc analytical tools will permit new and unappreciated problematics to emerge.
                    These new efforts thus conceive of the object of literary historiography as
                    dynamic, as in tension, as in conflict, in that they mobilize a series of new
                    concepts to coordinate and identify these tensions and conflicts.</p>
                <p>If we turn back to Brandes, we rediscover a measure of the elements of these new
                    literary histories. As noted, Brandes also had a sense of wanting to analyze
                    conditions that had not been charted out beforehand: a polemical scheme of the
                    configurations of the reaction and its overcoming during the 19th century. If
                        <em>French Global</em> challenges the national understanding of French
                    literature, and if <em>A New History of French Literature</em> challenges the
                    logic of causation ad turns anecdote and determinism upside down (neither of
                    these things is innocent), then it seems that what Jean Thorel is primarily
                    provoked by is that Brandes has no methodology, and thus no corresponding
                    concepts or categories with which to administer his big idea of reaction and
                    overcoming, and thus comes across as tautological.</p>
                <p>Brandes’ work is of course in the main a long series of author portraits, which
                    do not in this manner feed into or “prove” the thesis. But that which Brandes,
                    in his lack of a recognizable methodology, did possess – and this is perhaps
                    what most provoked Thorel – was two quite effective metaphorical registers with
                    which to dramatize the material in relation to his idea. Instead of concepts and
                    categories to identify the content of his literary history, Brandes develops two
                    figurative registers to place the events and structures that are decisive in his
                    grand literary historical scheme. In the first place, he employs the water
                    metaphorics: main currents, tributaries, dykes, swamps etc. are concepts that
                    recur in the majority of Brandes’ volumes and are employed to illuminate the
                    complexity of the diachronic course of reaction that functions as the point of
                    departure for <em>Main Currents</em>.</p>
                <p>In the second place, in <em>The Romantic School in France</em>, Brandes develops
                    a metaphorics taken over from physics, according to which the Romantic school is
                    portrayed as a magnetic field that rejected the new capitalist market economy,
                    the political conservatism, the financial bourgeoisie, and the new opportunistic
                    art, yet wholly naturally maintained the similarly charged elements that thereby
                    acclaimed and strengthened one another’s productions. This pictorial language,
                    it can asserted, was Brandes’ method of getting hold of the <em>synchronic</em>
                    aspect of the overcoming of reactionary and reactive France. A positively
                    charged field, which in a few years gathered authors and artists into a school
                    that consequently dissolved into individual careers, which correspond to the
                    portraits that take up the second half of Brandes’ fifth volume.</p>
                <p>In other words, Brandes on the one hand has a (polemical) idea of literary
                    historical development in Europe as well as, on the other, a stylistic method of
                    dramatizing this idea. In this manner it can be said that Brandes is modern for
                    two reasons, first because he conceives of the important points in literary
                    history as problems, conflicts and tensions (not new ideas or genres), second
                    because he is aware that the new conception of the conflict-ridden gravitational
                    points of literary history requires something more than the kind of scientific
                    methodology Thorel demanded. In order that the decisive problems and conflicts
                    come forth and become comprehensible in their historical development, a series
                    of stylized images are required, images that reveal the lines and the patterns
                    for which there are no corresponding scientific concepts.</p>
                <p>As mentioned, Brandes had already announced in the first volume of <em>Main
                        Currents</em> that there would be talk of a drama in six acts, yet in these
                    final remarks on the modernity of Brandes we have a different and a deeper
                    variant of this initial pronouncement, namely that the drama is not just a
                    manner of organizing the historical development of an immense amount of
                    material, but also a stylistic method. With a little audacity, it could be
                    concluded that <em>Main Currents</em> constitutes the first foray of literary
                    studies into not a comparative literary history, but an experimental literary
                    history, which would examine the potential and the boundaries of an idea that
                    cannot be identified by classical literary historiography. In <em>Main
                        Currents</em>, Georg Brandes found a style that would permit literary
                    history to unfold itself as a drama.</p>

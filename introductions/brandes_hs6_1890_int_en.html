            <div class="chapter">
                <p><em>Young Germany</em> – the sixth and final volume of <em>Main Currents</em> –
                    was nearly as long in the making as the first five volumes altogether, and we
                    can well understand his sense of relief when at long last in 1890 Brandes was
                    able to complete that work which had followed him ever since he had presented
                    its ambitious plan in the introduction to <em>Emigrant Literature</em> in
                    1872.</p>
                <p><em>Young Germany</em> is at once the lengthiest and the least homogeneous of the
                    six volumes. While the previous five volumes were each possessed of a delimiting
                    theme around which the narrative was structured, there is something unfocused
                    and disjointed about the sixth volume, as if the author had found it difficult
                    to determine what should be included and which story he would tell. Surely some
                    of this is due to the material, which not only proved to be more difficult to
                    shape and to synthesize than expected, but further did not contain as many
                    essential authorships as those which constituted the foundation of the other
                    volumes. Part of the explanation for why the content of the final volume does
                    not kick up more sparks, and for why Jørgen Knudsen deemed it “the dullest of
                    the six” (Knudsen 1994:379), is presumably to be found in the nature of the
                    subject matter.</p>
                <p> Yet neither was the author who had initially launched such an ambitious project
                    the same as the one who would now bring it to completion. The subject matter did
                    not captivate him in the same manner as earlier, for other authors and projects
                    beckoned, and the youthful faith in the political-ideological program that
                    underpinned the formation of the original plan, if it had not entirely vanished,
                    had at any rate been overlaid by the skepticism of middle age. If for the
                    younger Brandes a poetic work stood or fell by virtue of its inherent political
                    tendency, then for the elder Brandes the measure is found exclusively in the
                    personality of the poet, regardless of the presence of correct political
                    attitudes, indeed even regardless of whether the poet is interested in politics
                    at all.</p>
                <p> Ultimately, the world at the conclusion of the 1880s appeared rather distinct
                    from that at the beginning of the 1870s, and not the least to the south of the
                    Danish-German border. In the course of the nearly six years he had lived in
                    Berlin, Brandes had had ample opportunity to observe up close the cultural and
                    political development of the new German Reich, and conditions seemed to him to
                    be far from encouraging. In Brandes’ view, the Germany that took form under the
                    leadership of Bismarck was a military- and police-state in the image of the old
                    Prussian kingdom, defined by subject mentality and cultural stagnation. Well
                    enough he acknowledged the greatness of Bismarck, especially in foreign policy,
                    but it was of concern to him that the German Chancellor, by concentrating power
                    in his own person, kept the population in a state of political infancy and
                    immaturity.</p>
                <p>All these circumstances, in greater or lesser degree, were significant in the
                    crafting of <em>Young Germany</em>.</p>

                <h2>a. <em>Young Germany</em>. Periodization, selected authorships, omissions</h2>
                <p>Despite the eighteen years between the publication of the first and sixth volumes
                    of <em>Main Currents</em>, Brandes proceeded in almost all essentials according
                    to the plan for <em>Young Germany</em> he had presented in the introduction to
                        <em>Emigrants Literature</em>: <blockquote>”[…] the sixth and last group of
                        writers is inspired by the ideas of the Greek war and the July revolution
                        and, like the French writers, in Byron’s shade sees the leader of the
                        movement for freedom. The most important of these young writers are of
                        Jewish descent: Heinrich Heine, Ludwig Börne, and later Berthold Auerbach.”
                        (Brandes 1872:13-14)</blockquote> Upon close examination of <em>Young
                        Germany</em>, we discover that Berthold Auerbach is barely mentioned, and
                    that the shadow of Byron does not loom as large as it did for the young Brandes.
                    Yet the central idea did not change, and both Heine and Börne maintain their
                    narrative centrality as initially planned.</p>
                <p>“Young Germany” is a designation for a relatively small group of authors whose
                    central core includes, in addition to the aforementioned Heinrich Heine and
                    Ludwig Börne, Karl Gutzkow, Heinrich Laube, Theodor Mundt, and Ludolf Wienbarg.
                    What connected them was a more or less directly expressed critique of the
                    Metternichian system as well as corresponding agitation for political reforms,
                    liberal conceptions of freedom, anti-clericalism, in short, an emancipatory
                    program that broke with the abstraction and unworldliness of late idealism and
                    the political conservatism of the Restoration (Hermand 1974:370-2). Literature
                    should keep abreast of the age and engage with social and political questions
                    instead of seeking refuge in a lofty kingdom of allegedly eternal values. For
                    the same reason the poets of Young Germany had little time for the national
                    treasure that was Goethe, who was viewed as the chief representative of the
                    political impotency of the Restoration – a “fool for stability” and a “servant
                    of the princes,” who handed over an unfree people to the pleasure of the prince
                    (Hermand 1974:372). Not all were equally thorough in their critique, and on the
                    whole the authors of Young Germany had a wide scope when it came to the national
                    and political implementation of their liberal ideas. Some sought a republic,
                    though in the case of Börne with a cosmopolitan bent: “I hate every society that
                    is less than the whole of human society” (Börne 1964a:625) [Ich hasse jede
                    Gesellschaft, die kleiner ist als die menschliche]. Others in contrast contented
                    themselves with a constitutional monarchy within the national boundaries. And
                    while all were capable of intervening on behalf of the cause of political
                    liberty and especially freedom of expression, only Börne and Georg Büchner were
                    seriously preoccupied with questions of a social nature (Hermand
                    1974:384-5).</p>
                <p>This broad scope is in part explained by the fact that the above mentioned
                    authors really did not have all that much to do with one another (Hohendahl
                    2004:568-9). Strictly speaking, they first became a distinct group when the
                    Federal Diet in Frankfurt – after a previous smear campaign against especially
                    Gutzkow, led by Wolfgang Menzel, a litigious and at the time influential
                    newspaper publisher with whom Gitzkow had earlier collaborated – instituted a
                    total ban on the writings of Heine, Mundt, Gutzkow, Laube, and Wienberg across
                    the German Confederation. Menzel’s group charged the authors “under the name
                    ‘Young Germany’ or ‘Young Literature’” with “openly . . . attacking the
                    Christian religion in the most brazen manner, disparaging existing social
                    conditions, and undermining all discipline and decency” (Verbot der Schriften
                    des ‘Jungen Deutschland’ vom 10. Dezember 1835) [unter der Bennenung “das junge
                    Deutschland” oder “die junge Literatur” . . . unverholen . . . die christliche
                    Religion auf die frecheste Weise anzugreifen, die bestehenden sozialen
                    Verhältnisse herabzuwürdigen und alle Zucht und Sittlichkeit zu verstören].</p>
                <p>It is thus this little and relatively heterogeneous group of authors who make up
                    the nucleus of <em>Young Germany</em>, although Brandes must widen the
                    perspective in order to make it work and even more so to have something to write
                    about. Aside from the fact that the central figures of <em>Young Germany</em>
                    can be counted on one hand, it is also the case that the peak period of this
                    brief era in German literature did not encompass much more than the five years
                    or so between the July Revolution in France and the ban of 1835. Brandes
                    resolves this problem in a most obvious manner, namely by allowing the bond
                    between the authors to continue up to the revolutions of 1848, which in this way
                    comes to serve as the vanishing point not only of <em>Young Germany</em> but the entirety
                    of <em>Main Currents</em>. In addition, the work contains a series of perspectival
                    chapters on among other things the philosophy of the period (G.W.F. Hegel,
                    Ludwig Feuerbach) and its most prominent female figures (Bettina von Arnhim,
                    Rahel Varnhagen, Charlotte Stieglitz), none of which is necessary for the volume
                    to cohere. Ultimately he includes as well the ubiquitous Goethe, who serves
                    Brandes as a continual point of connection and comparison to the majority of the
                    main figures of Young Germany and alongside Heine is the single most important
                    person in the volume.</p>
                <p>The main problem for Brandes was however that neither the authors of Young
                    Germany nor the political literature of the period up to 1848 is from the
                    artistic point of view particularly interesting. And even though Brandes is
                    undoubtedly correct in his assertion that Heine’s declining popularity after the
                    unification of Germany in 1871 was predominately due to political concerns, the
                    same does not apply to the rest of the Young Germany authors, none of which
                    figure prominently in German literary history, not excepting the prominent
                    accounts in Brandes’ own time. And he was not successful in finding a satisfying
                    solution to this problem, even though numerous possibilities were available. The
                    most natural solution would have been to offer Biedermeier literature as a
                    contrast to the political literature. But Brandes lays this to rest with a short
                    and idiosyncratic chapter on “Neutral Literature,” which is limited to the
                    authors in which the Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm IV was interested and with
                    whom he associated during his rule (Alexander von Humboldt, Ludwig Tieck,
                    Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué, Friedrich Rückert, Hermann von Pückler-Muskau, and
                    Ferdinand Freiligrath). He does not, however, seem to be aware of the most
                    important German language poets of the period, the Biedermeier figures Eduard
                    Mörike and Annette von Droste-Hülshoff, and two of the periods great dramatists,
                    Friedrich Hebbel and Franz Grillparzer, are mentioned only in passing.</p>
                <p>Even stranger still is that Brandes fails to pluck two particularly low hanging
                    fruits who were additionally closely associated with Young Germany – Georg
                    Büchner and Christian Dietrich Grabbe. The canonization of Büchner – along with
                    Heine the only one of the period’s political poets who is still read outside
                    German Studies – first begins to gather steam in the course of the 20th century,
                    but his name was known in the relevant literary circles long before then. This
                    was due in large part to Karl Gutzkow, who saw him as a political ally and among
                    other things published his revolutionary drama <em>Dantons Tod</em> in his
                    journal <em>Phönix</em> already in 1835, albeit in a more palatable version for
                    fear of the censors (Borgards 2009:318-19). That Büchner is already included as
                    an independent entry in the 1838 <em>Conversations-Lexikon der Gegenwart</em>
                    can thus be attributed to the legwork of Gutzkow in the preceeding years. That
                    Brandes was aware of him is almost undeniable, presuming he had in fact read
                        <em>Dantons Tod</em> (Knudsen 1994:380). Why he does not mention him remains
                    thus a bit of a mystery. Even in Johannes Prölß’s more orthodox contemporary
                    account of the movement,<em>Das junge Deutschland</em>, Büchner is discussed in
                    detail in numerous places (Prölß 1892:34, 585-7). Compared to Büchner, Grabbe is
                    a significantly more peripheral figure, yet it is in the least conspicuous that
                    Brandes also fails to mention one of the period’s great renewers of the
                    historical drama.</p>
                <p>That the discussion of Heine consumes nearly a quarter of <em>Young Germany</em>
                    thus has its reasons. With respect to quality, one can do no better than Heine,
                    particularly if Büchner, Grabbe and the Biedermeier poets are passed over.
                    Brandes himself addresses this problem in the prelude to his commentary on
                    Heine: “this literary group includes no poetic spirit of the very first order
                    and only a single one of a quite elevated rank: Heine. It has not left us with
                    much in the way of the positive, as it functions mostly through negativity,
                    through its capacity to release tension and to clear the air. It is strong in
                    its skepticism and in its hatred of servitude, and in its individualism”
                    (Brandes 1890a:51). But Heine’s central placement in <em>Young Germany</em> also
                    has an autobiographical component, for few poets have played such an important
                    role for the young Brandes. From his first acquaintance with
                        <em>Reisebilder</em> (1826-1830)as a fourteen-year-old in 1856 until he
                    began his <em>Main Currents</em> lectures at the University of Copenhagen, Heine
                    functioned again and again as Brandes’ literary guide and companion (Dahl
                    1985:92-3). It was Heine who introduced him to Hegelianism, and who just as
                    importantly acquainted him with the Hellenistic cult of beauty as an opposing
                    pole to the asceticism of Christianity. Through Hippolyte Taine, who considered
                    Heine to be among the greatest of poets, his enthusiasm was later strengthened
                    (Dahl 1985:94). In May of 1871, during his grand tour of Europe, he wrote home
                    to his parents from Napoli: “I came home from the theater and read through the
                    night a part of Heine’s ’Reisebilder’in French. Décidement, Heine is one of the
                    greatest writers the world has produced. The older one gets the more one admires
                    him as a writer. As I have said and thought for more than two years, he is the
                    only one of Germany’s authors who will endure after Goethe. He is the only one
                    of all of them who in certain respects has approached him. I want to reread him
                    methodically” (Brandes 1978:285-6). The thorough treatment of Heine in <em>Young
                        Germany</em> may thus be understood as the fulfillment of a promise to
                    reread Heine “properly”.</p>
                <div>
                    <h2>b. ’An Arbeit klebt Blut’. <em>Young Germany</em> in the Melting Pot</h2>
                    <p>Work on <em>Young Germany</em> stretched over the majority of a decade, with
                        long interruptions along the way. Already in 1882, when the fifth volume on
                        French Romanticism was completed with “passionate fervor,” Brandes
                        resolutely embarked on “the reading of the innumerable books” that had to be
                        studied before the concluding volume could be written (Brandes 1908:46). At
                        this point he had been living in Berlin for more than five years, and thus
                        he found himself not only temporally but also geographically closer to the
                        sources than he had been in producing the previous volumes. How much of this
                        material he had already digested before he began his preliminary studies for
                        the sixth volume is evident from the notes and travel letters from Berlin
                        which were later collected in <em>Berlin as the German Capital</em> (1885).
                        When Karl Gutzkow died in 1878, for example, Brandes used the occasion to
                        draw a portrait of the author who “felt himself alienated from the era of
                        Bismarck, unappreciated and forgotten” (Brandes 1885:249-50). And in an 1881
                        note on “The Movement Against the Jews in Germany,” Brandes provides
                        perspective by pointing to Börne and Heine, whose critique of Prussia and
                        “bloody satirical verses about Frederick the Great,” according to Brandes,
                        had fueled the fires of anti-Semitism (Brandes 1885:372-4). Still other
                        notes contain more or less detailed remarks on Feuerbach (p. 108), Auerbach
                        (p. 131-2, 262), Gottfried Keller (p. 258-60), Rahel Varnhagen (p. 289-90)
                        and many of the other personalities who appear in <em>Young
                        Germany</em>.</p>
                    <p>Beyond functioning as a kind of unintentional preliminary to preliminary
                        study, the Berlin years undeniably provided a more objective and, so to
                        speak, disillusioned view of the immense distance between the consciousness
                        of the 1848 revolutions and the new German Reich. In the same note
                        memorialized Gutzkow, we thus find a fierce critique of the liberal
                        bourgeoisie, which according to Brandes not only have forgotten everything
                        about their own part in the 1848 revolutions, but moreover no longer even
                        understand it. In contemporary literature, Brandes asserts, a 48er appears
                        as either a naïve idealist “or as a giddy rebel, a traitor against
                        fatherland and king.” And for the few remaining from that era, matters are
                        not more favorable: if they are not in exile, they have “either denied their
                        past or remain silent or have gone back to the feckless opposition of old”
                        (Brandes 1885:253).</p>
                    <p>That Brandes judges the liberals so severely is naturally also a reflection
                        of how high he has set the ideals now being betrayed – and perhaps also
                        indirectly a kind of admission that he had been rather naïve to see in
                        contemporary liberals the inheritors of the generation of 1848. His verdict
                        on the occasion of the thirty years anniversary of the revolution –
                        delivered in March 1878, a few months after his arrival in Berlin – attests
                        to this: “What a vigorous and enthusiastic generation it was, how not vainly
                        it risked blood and life for its hopes, its delusions, its designs. The
                        newly created German Reich owes everything it has in freethinking and faith
                        in ideas to it” (Brandes 1885:107). Only half a year later Brandes no longer
                        maintained any delusions that the German Reich was in any manner indebted to
                        the freethinking of the 48ers. It was now on the contrary clear to him that
                        modern Germany was patterned on Prussian militarism, and that the lack of
                        freedom in Bismarck’s military state was a reflection of “the German
                        people’s political immaturity” (Brandes 1885:168).</p>
                    <p>Back in Copenhagen Brandes continued work on <em>Young Germany</em>, and as
                        usual this took place in close engagement with the capital’s literary minded
                        citizenry. Hardly had he returned home from Berlin before
                            <em>Dags-Avisen</em> noted that “yesterday evening Dr. Georg Brandes
                        gave his first public lectures on ‘Young Germany’” before an enthusiastic
                        audience “of five hundred” (<em>Dags-Avisen</em> Feb 27, 1883). A few days
                        later this success was repeated with an equally large turnout, again
                        remarked upon by <em>Dags-Avisen</em> (Mar 2, 1883). The next lectures
                        followed in April, and the quick tempo was continued through the year with
                        addresses in October and December. Thereafter he apparently ran out of
                        steam, occupying himself with other more pressing projects. As can be
                        gathered from his library records, which function like a barometer of his
                        shifting interests, in 1884 he was particularly occupied with Holberg, while
                        his borrowings in 1885 were dominated by literature on Poland (Nolin
                        1965:116). In 1886 he borrowed a series of titles by Schlegel, Novalis,
                        Brentano, Hölderlin, and Chamisso for use in revising the German edition of
                        volume two of <em>Main Currents</em>, <em>Die romantische Schule in
                            Deutschland</em> (Nolin 1965:116-17). Only in 1887 was study for
                            <em>Young Germany</em> resumed, and this time it continued consistently
                        until the completion of the manuscript, with parallel lectures on Heine and
                        his contemporaries from the beginning of November through mid-December of
                        1887. A longer preliminary study on Börne and Goethe was published in the
                        journal <em>Tilskueren</em> ( I, 1884: 1-19), a shorter piece on Heine and
                        Rembrandt in <em>Jule-Kalender</em> (III, 1887:21-6), and still another on
                        Heine in Peter Nansens journal <em>Af Dagens Krønike</em> (I, 1889:50-63),
                        for which Brandes served as collaborator during a brief interlude. </p>
                    <p>In October of 1890, after ten years of labor, he was at long last at the end
                        of the road. Just how unbearable the last few months in particular had been
                        is clearly evident in his memoirs: “I was immeasurably burned out and
                        exhausted with the last part of <em>Main Gurrents</em>. I had dragged it
                        along with me since the beginning of 1883, gasping, cursing it, suffering
                        through the execution of an old plan devised by the person I had been in
                        1871. I recalled the words: <em>An Arbeit klebt Blut</em> (work costs
                        blood). I had as mentioned allowed eleven of its sheets to be printed. Now
                        it was impossible for me to remain occupied with it. I felt like a clipped
                        wild goose” (Brandes 1908:273). Thus all the greater was his relief at
                        having crossed the finish line, completing not only this volume but the
                        entire work. His joy at seeing the last printed sheet of <em>Young
                            Germany</em> laid out before him resulted in a poetic look back at the
                        entire work in the form of a distich for each of the six volumes: “I / A war
                        of all wars it was, meant to arouse, to call to arms –/ It awakened hatred,
                        that became my fate. // II / A time for spears – and while all around me
                        they rained/ to the wall my old specter was nailed. / / III / A time for
                        swords – I did not feel myself hard pressed, / I lived young and strong and
                        despised and suffered and longed. / / IV / In faith and blood red zeal it
                        was written. / Shelley! Its spirit belongs to you. You I have lived. / / V /
                        See how fate turns! Hear its clear tones / A time of triumph! a long, rich,
                        melodious fanfare. / / Out of steady defiance and bitter life experience /
                        the final volume of the work is a revelation” (Brandes 1908:284).</p>

                    <h2>c. Later Revisions to the Text</h2>
                    <p>Brandes continued to make more or less sweeping changes to the individual
                        parts of <em>Main Currents</em> long after 1890. Already in 1877 the second,
                        completely rewritten edition of <em>Emigrant Literature</em> had come out,
                        which was followed in 1891 by a rewritten second edition of <em>The Romantic
                            School in Germany</em>. Immediately after the completion of <em>Young
                            Germany</em> it was time for a re-inspection of volume five, after which
                        “a fundamental reworking of the third part” (Brandes 1908:352) was expected,
                        and further a re-visitation of volume four, which was to be “revised” and
                        furnished with “individual additions” and so on. It is, explains Brandes,
                        like the “fortifications surrounding a city. As soon as the work is
                        completed, it must be taken up again and spread outward” (Ibid).</p>
                    <p>In light of the considerable extent of this mania for revision, it is
                        striking how few changes were made to later editions of volume six, and this
                        despite the fact that its first edition is more than double the length of
                        the first edition of volume one. There are hardly any changes in the second
                        edition of volume six in 1898, in the third they are limited to seven in
                        total, and in the following editions there are none at all. Because we are
                        aware of just how difficult the last volume was for Brandes, it is
                        reasonable to presume that the explanation for this is found in his lack of
                        desire to engage further with the material. That this played a role cannot
                        be denied. But presumably more important is that <em>Young Germany</em> as
                        the final volume to be written was significantly closer in form to that for
                        which the author had initially aimed in the first volume. Characteristically
                        enough, the changes to the third edition do not at all seem to be segments
                        of a larger reappraisal. For the most part they consist of the additions he
                        made to his separate monograph on Heine from 1897, on the occasion of the
                        centennial of the poet’s birth.. Compared to the substantial reworking of
                        the other volumes, this relative lack of revision could indicate that there
                        were no weighty political or aesthetic concerns behind the changes to
                            <em>Young Germany</em>.</p>
                    <p>The most substantial additions to the Heine material include a brief
                        digression on the affection of German composers for him as well as a fuller
                        portrait of the woman with whom Heine lived during his final years (Brandes
                        1900:372-3, 500-1). The most interesting addition is however a new summary
                        and evaluation of the poet, which after a lyrical ode to the cosmopolitan
                        Heine uniting “Germanic emotional romanticism with French esprit and Jewish
                        inwardness” delivers a kick in the teeth to both the German and French
                        negligence of Heine: “the new German Reich has refused to raise the monument
                        to Heinrich Heine his admirers have sought and which he himself could well
                        do without . . . Even in the little provincial city in which he was born, no
                        statue of him has dared to be erected. And opposite the attitude of the
                        German Reich, the Frenchmen of our time have not at all had the thought or
                        the courage to raise a monument to him in the Paris he loved so dearly and
                        in which he lived the second half of his life” (Brandes 1900:503-4). If
                        German narrow-mindedness and chauvinism on the one side and French cowardice
                        on the other has meant that Heine has not been honored for his services to
                        German or to his second fatherland of France, he is on the other hand more
                        popular outside of Germany today than any other German language author,
                        indeed even “Byron himself has hardly impacted the nineteenth century as
                        profoundly as him” (Brandes 1900:504). Given the central place occupied by
                        Byron in the overall architecture of <em>Main Currents</em>, this must be
                        said to be a noteworthy addition. As if to emphasize this point Brandes
                        concludes the new section by reeling off a list of Heine-inspired poets in
                        other parts of Europe, especially in the Nordic countries.</p>
                    <p>Finally, Brandes has made a small but not uninteresting change to the final
                        lines of the third edition, which in the first edition is directed at the
                        voices who over the years have criticized him for being too selective in his
                        choices and compared him to Procrustes. “Herein lies the answer,” says
                        Brandes with a certain pride in 1890, “namely that the true Procrustes,” who
                        had selected and grouped, “is nothing other than the power we are otherwise
                        in the habit of calling art” (Brandes 1890a:572-3). Polemical to the last,
                        sharply and tersely formulated and as such wholly commensurate with the
                        original sting of the work, and yet upon closer reflection perhaps after all
                        not an entirely worthy conclusion to ten years of labor. At any rate both
                        the polemical tone and the reference to Procrustes were removed from the
                        third edition.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>a. Between "Hero-Worship" and Emancipatory Struggle. <em>Main Current's</em>
                Tensions</h2>
            <p><em>Main Currents</em> is in all respects a work that is marked by its long period of
                genesis, and it could hardly be otherwise, Procrustes or not. On the one hand
                Brandes naturally did not remain the hothead he had been when as
                twenty-nine-year-old he had so forcefully introduced his plan for the work, and on
                the other the world was not the same in 1890 as it had been in 1871. There was
                obviously no one more aware of this than Brandes himself, who not only rewrote and
                reworked the early volumes beyond recognition, but further at various opportunities
                let it be clearly known how his aesthetic and political views had changed in the
                intervening years. Not everyone understood or accepted this, which irritated
                Brandes, who often felt that his opponents lumped the older <em>hommes de
                    lettres</em> in with the young radical when they criticized points of view that
                did not seem to him to accord with his actual position. In a characteristic passage
                from his memoirs, Brandes explains how his radicalism over time slowly came to find
                a natural counterweight in “a strong historical sense of the connection between the
                times and a consciousness of the impossibility of working from scratch. From the end
                of the 1870s onward, my writings and opinions came more and more to be defined by a
                certain equilibrium of rationality” (Brandes 1908:384). But this flew right over the
                heads of his opponents, who continued to portray him as a “blind, fanatical
                partisan” (Ibid).</p>
            <p>Sympathetic readers, then, had a more acute understanding of the development of and
                the internal tensions within the work. Brandes refers to a letter he received after
                    <em>Young Germany</em> had been published, in which the anonymous correspondent
                expresses his indignation at the role Goethe is assigned in the final volume: “thus,
                the letter bitterly laments, the whole spiritual revolution runs its course in the
                deification of Goethe!” (Ibid). Brandes categorically denies that his enthusiasm for
                Goethe is of a more recent vintage and points to his unrestrained praise in
                    <em>Goethe and Denmark</em> (1881). Yet since Brandes’ citation of the letter
                draws attention to the correspondent’s acumen in contrast to the lack thereof in his
                other opponents, and since it otherwise does not refute that the critic’s interest
                in Goethe steadily increased, this is also a kind of confession.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile Brandes had provided the clearest description of his understanding of the
                development of <em>Main Currents</em> already long before the completion of the
                final volume and in a different context. In a letter to his German publisher that he
                had published in <em>Politiken</em> in July 1887, he briefly described the
                development the second volume had undergone between the first edition in 1873 and
                the second in 1887. Although this account only concerns <em>The Romantic School in
                    Germany</em>, at the very least it is just as relevant to <em>Main Currents</em>
                as a complete composition and work. Brandes begins by stating that the first edition
                of <em>The Romantic School in Germany</em> was a “polemical exercise” that “attacked
                the dead German Romantics in order to locate behind them the living Danish
                Romantics.” Next he asserts that his present foundational aesthetic understanding is
                quite different from what it was in 1871. Whereas then he judged individual works
                according to the “religious and political attitudes” of their authors, he now, in
                1887, understands the art of poetry as the mirroring of “the whole and full life of
                a people and age.” Finally there is the question of style and method: “when I began
                work on <em>Main Currents</em> in 1871,” Brandes explains, “I was still not
                metaphysically minded in my intellectual orientation. I overlooked the
                personalities; they were for me only the organs for expressing ideas . . . The
                individual personalities were held aloft by the currents, split apart by them; they
                were mouthpieces for the ideas. Their personalities were not of interest to the
                author.” In the first edition of the second volume the biographical portraits are
                included as brief and incomplete supplements following after the review of the
                individual works, as a kind of “necessary evil.” Only much later, after he no longer
                presumed there to be to “an abstract world spirit” that had produced the works, did
                he begin to immerse himself in “the historical personalities, demonstrating <em>how
                    their production emerged out of their lives</em>.” In summary, the 1873 and 1887
                editions of <em>The Romantic School in Germany</em> are significantly distinguished
                from one another in at least three respects: “while the original task of the work
                was to agitate, in the second edition it became purely scientific; it was thus
                conceived as national and Danish and then became universal. In the beginning my
                understanding of poetry and art was conditioned by tendentiousness; it is now
                otherwise. Ultimately my understanding of the relation between ideas and
                personalities was turned on its head, resulting in a correspondingly different
                conception of the composition of the work” (Brandes 1887).</p>
            <p>Now in fairness it should be noted that Brandes’ account is in fact a brief in a
                pending German court case. Because Denmark was not a signatory to the Berne
                Convention on literary copyright, and thus Brandes could not claim copyright abroad,
                his German publisher, after the publication of the second edition of <em>The
                    Romantic School in Germany</em>, stood accused for technical and juridical
                reasons of having unlawfully republished a partially existing work (Bjerring-Hansen
                2016:127-34). In other words, Brandes had an obvious interest in getting the first
                and second editions to be viewed as two different books. That said, it is still
                difficult to disagree with the characterization that precisely summarizes the most
                important differences between the two editions, and in this context more importantly
                points at a more general tendency across the entire work. The latter point is most
                easily illustrated by comparing the volumes furthest apart from one another in time,
                that is the first editions of <em>Emigrant Literature</em> and <em>Young
                    Germany</em>. While the former – as Brandes points out – emphasizes currents and
                ideas and is strong in its faith in enlightenment and progress in history (“Faith in
                the right of free inquiry and the final triumph of free thinking”) [Brandes 1872:7],
                the latter is significantly more concerned in the biographical material of “the
                great personalities” and correspondingly less occupied with the “emancipatory
                struggle of humanity” (Brandes 1890a:38), which characteristically is wholly
                eclipsed when he turns his gaze on the present age and the contemporary generation
                (“what we call progress is a sickly snail”) [Brandes 1890a:536]. But also within the
                individual sections of <em>Main Currents</em>, this tension is repeatedly found in
                greater and lesser degrees. Even in the original introduction to <em>Emigrant
                    Literature</em>, by far and away the most agitational and programmatic passages
                in the entire work, it is far from the case that everything is dominated by currents
                and ideas. Already here we can without great difficulty locate traces that
                anticipate or in any case hint at the “hero worship” (Brandes 1908:151) of the later
                authorship, such as for example when Brandes – in a formulation that could be
                inspired by John Stuart Mill’s <em>On Liberty</em> (see for example Mill 2003: 76-7,
                128-38) – points to the conflict between “the personalities” and to the tyranny of
                public opinion.</p>

            <h2>b. "The Great Personality". Goethe as Measuring Stick</h2>
            <p><em>Young Germany</em> contains many of the same tensions and ambivalences as the
                other volumes, but the manner in which they are managed is to a certain extent
                distinguished from the rest of the work. This is due first and foremost to the
                nature of the material, which as mentioned no longer emitted the same transfiguring
                glow it once had for the young Brandes, and neither was it commensurable with his
                later understanding of literary art. What had seemed to him to be a definitive
                conclusion to the work, as long as he still thought in terms of abstract philosophy
                of history, was less so after he had moved on from the Hegelian world spirit in
                favor of an experiential and biographical aesthetics, according to which art was
                conceived as “the expression of mental perturbations” with “the aim of calling forth
                mental perturbations” (Brandes 1890a:50). Young Germany as a political movement was
                perhaps a necessary enough current within “the great rhythmic ebb and flow of
                history” (Brandes 1890a:571), yet parceled out into individual artistic biographies,
                the group was inconsequential and uninteresting from the literary perspective and
                could not form the foundation of the final volume of <em>Main Currents</em>. Equally
                as important, it was too artistically insignificant to maintain the author’s
                interest.</p>
            <p>As indicated, Brandes attempted to resolve the problem by providing much more space
                for Heine, by lengthening the period under study, and by incorporating a series of
                figures whose alleged connection to Young Germany perhaps does not always seem
                convincing. Among these figures the most important is without a doubt Goethe, whose
                place in German literary history of the first half of the nineteenth century surely
                enough is incontestable. Yet he plays such a prominent role in the end of volume six
                that we can well understand the aforementioned correspondent’s astonishment: how in
                the world can Brandes assign to Goethe – the <em>geheimrat</em> who not only found
                himself on the wrong side of the barricades in the “emancipatory struggle of
                humanity” but also was not particularly interested in politics – such a place of
                honor in a narrative account of the movements and currents that came to a head in
                the 1848 revolutions? The answer is of course already provided by the critic’s shift
                in interest from currents toward great individuals, and as is well known, none of
                the figures of Young Germany were greater than the universal spirit that was
                Goethe.</p>
            <p>The most remarkable aspect of Goethe’s role in the sixth volume of <em>Main
                    Currents</em> is however not that he is placed at center stage every time
                Brandes sees a chance to do so. On the contrary, it is that throughout the immense
                amount of material treated in <em>Young Germany</em>, he functions as a kind of
                measuring stick for Brandes’ evaluation of the other authors and their placement
                within the volume; indeed, in some passages he almost seems to be the main objective
                of the narrative. This is perhaps most apparent in the long chapters on the three
                female figures, Rahel Varnhagen, Bettina von Arnim, and Charlotte Stieglitz, who are
                evaluated according to their views of Goethe. Of Varnhagen Brandes notes that “her
                critical literary significance” is due to the fact “it was her who first in Berlin
                sensed and expressed the worth of Goethe” (Brandes 1890a:396). And her inclusion in
                the narrative is justified by reference to Goethe’s significance: “through studying
                the most remarkable female figures of the time, we discover that between 1810 and
                1835, the most deeply penetrating event, the subtlest and deepest secret of the
                time, was that the worldview of Goethe, point by point, had displaced the Church and
                had conquered all the great instincts and authentic movements of the era” (Brandes
                1890a:384). In short, the three women have earned a place in the narrative because
                they have distinguished themselves by being especially sensitive seismographs,
                measuring the depths and the impact of Goetheism. Here it is almost as if Goethe has
                become the overriding concern, and that anything that can contribute to a clearer
                illustration of the status of this universal spirit within German intellectual life
                is justified out of hand.</p>
            <p>Less extensive on the other hand is the employment of Goethe in the discussion of the
                relation between art and politics, which runs like an undercurrent through <em>Young
                    Germany</em> and is among the clearest indications of how far Brandes has come
                since he began the work. First on the witness stand is Börne, and Brandes
                immediately confronts him by pointing to his uncompromising attitude toward Goethe:
                “perhaps nothing has more damaged Börne’s present reputation than his vehement
                denunciation of Goethe” (Brandes 1890a:54). Brandes goes to great lengths to
                understand the origins of this uncompromising hatred. A considerable measure of
                explanation is found in their biographies: both Goethe and Börne are from Frankfort,
                yet they might as well have come from different worlds. Goethe was born into the
                upper bourgeoisie, Börne grew up in the city’s Jewish quarter. Whereas Goethe came
                into the world with proverbial silver spoon in mouth, Börne as a Jew was a pariah
                without civil rights, subject to derision and confined to the inhumane ghetto of
                cramped, dark alleyways he dare not leave during the daytime. Brandes concludes that
                “it is clear that such conditions must have exerted an influence on an
                impressionable young mind” (Brandes 1890a:58). Wisely enough, Brandes is hesitant to
                draw overly broad conclusions from these conditions; his point is narrower, that
                Börne’s political views are intimately bound up with these childhood experiences,
                which at once laid the ground for his sense of justice and provided particularly
                fertile ground for his contempt of Goethe, that servant of the princes. And even
                though Brandes does not agree with Börne’s sense that Goethe’s work as a minister of
                state should be understood as political betrayal, he is faithful in reproducing this
                critique and must concede that Börne “has pointed out weak points in Goethe’s
                greatness and the limits of his being,” even if much of this solicitude immediately
                withers on the vine, when shortly thereafter he adds that “certain merits of Goethe
                could only be purchased in exchange for these lackings, and that in order not to
                splinter his many-sided genius he had been compelled to set firm limits for himself”
                (Brandes 1890a:105).</p>
            <p>Whatever the degree of understanding and insight Brandes brings to his treatment of
                Börne, we are however at no point in doubt about the outcome of this initial
                boasting match. In comparison to the ocean that is Goethe, Börne is and remains a
                pond, and even when he is at his strongest, he is at once too uncompromising, indeed
                almost Manichean in his vision of right and wrong, and too hot-tempered and naïve.
                In this respect his political analysis of the French July Revolution of 1830 is
                significant, for in Brandes’ view it had seemed hopelessly naive, and by the measure
                of “the contrast between that which was expected and that which happened, it’s
                impact was conspicuously comical” (Brandes 1890a:129). Börne’s letters from Paris
                bear witness to his honor and passion – and especially to his ravings. But the
                problem is first and foremost of an aesthetic nature. Positively formulated: “it can
                hardly surprise us, that he in whose spiritual makeup a sense of justice had
                developed so sharply and so finely that it formally served as a substitute for an
                actual aesthetic sensibility, must see such as lacking in Goethe, whose desire for
                justice was relatively undeveloped” (Brandes 1890a:129). Negatively formulated:
                “Börne did not possess an artistic sensibility in the strong sense of the word . . .
                that domain of Bildung, which considers art as art, was closed to him” (Brandes
                1890a:91-2) This can of course be well understood as a kind of explanation of the
                relation between art and politics: in Börne’s eyes, an artistic sensibility is
                uninteresting or even a (moral) impediment for true political engagement; literature
                and politics belong to two different spheres <em>and never the twain shall
                meet</em>. Yet this solution is hardly satisfying – especially for Brandes, who long
                before had outgrown such stereotypical binaries. Fortunately there is much more meat
                on Heine’s bones, the next witness to take the stand, and here Goethe truly comes
                into his own.</p>

            <h2>c. Aristocratic Radicalism. The Image of Heine in <em>Young Germany</em></h2>
            <p>Heine’s privileged position in <em>Young Germany</em> can as already mentioned be
                explained both biographically and literary historically. That Brandes makes him the
                star witness in his discussion between the relationship between literature and
                politics is however first and foremost due to other circumstances. Like the majority
                of the authors of his generation, Heine had a strained relationship to Goethe, whose
                being and work consumed so much that it could be difficult for younger poets to find
                a place at the table. Some reacted with an almost instinctual rejection, such as
                Börne, who did not conceal the fact that his political critique of the servant of
                the princes had deep roots: “As long as I have been able to feel, I have hated
                Goethe, as long as I have been able to think, I have known why” (Börne 1964b:71)
                [Seit ich fühle, habe ich Goethe gehaßt, seit ich denke, weiß ich warum]. Heine’s
                critique of Goethe is more ambivalent, but also much more principled. In contrast to
                Börne and others, Heine has much good to say about Goethe, both as poet and as
                critic of the reactionary and catholicizing tendencies of German Late Romanticism
                (Häntzschel 2001:63-7). Yet Goethe’s virtues at the same time point to his problems.
                Rightly enough, Goethe drove the brothers Schlegel out of the temple, and for this
                he deserves gratitude, but in so doing he also established himself as the sole
                overlord of German literature, and for Heine that is a problem. Correspondingly his
                immortal works “adorn our fatherland like pleasing statues adorn a garden, but they
                are statues. One can fall in love with them, but they are infertile” (<em>Die
                    Romantische Schule</em>, 1836; Heine 1979, 8:155) [Sie zieren unser theures
                Vaterland, wie schöne Statuen einen Garten zieren, aber es sind Statuen. Man kann
                sich darin verlieben, aber sie sind unfruchtbar]. Ultimately Heine acknowledges that
                while Goethe’s lack of interest in politics can possibly be justified by the nature
                of the age in which lived, it is no longer appropriate to the era and thus morally
                irresponsible. Literature should – and on this point he is in agreement with Börne –
                seek to make a political impact, and the poet ought to be conscious of his social
                responsibility.</p>
            <p>The reason that Brandes makes Heine the test case for his discussion of the
                relationship of literature to politics is not just that he is the only poet of the
                age who in an artistic sense can measure up to Goethe, but also that in his
                ambivalence he is closer to Brandes’ own position than the other Young Germany
                authors. And just as importantly, Heine’s ambivalence is by no means limited to
                Goethe, it is in fact a part of his constitution. For Brandes this is clearly
                evident in Heine’s political views, which at first glance come across as less than
                thought out or as without principals. On the one hand he represents “an outburst of
                the most extreme radicalism” that emerges from “the most strident revolutionary
                attitude” (Brandes 1890a:160), while on the other Heine reassures us again and again
                that he is no Jacobin, indeed even that he does not at all see himself as a
                republican. How to explain this extraordinary duality? Previously, notes Brandes, it
                has either not been explained at all or has been seen as evidence of his
                characterlessness. But Heine, asserts Brandes, was far from characterless, for on
                the contrary he was “from to first to last a faithful soul to his principles”
                (Ibid). According to Brandes the explanation is this that Heine was at the same time
                “a profound lover of freedom and a marked aristocrat,” at once a fiery opponent of
                every form of the denial freedom and a great admirer of “human greatness.” In other
                words, “there was not a drop of conservative blood in his Heine’s soul. His blood
                was revolutionary. Yet neither was there in his soul a drop of democratic blood. His
                blood was aristocratic, he would see genius acknowledged as leader and lord”
                (Brandes 1890a:165).</p>
            <p>Brandes would hardly have formulated it as such in the 1870s, and even less with so
                much sympathy. It is conspicuous to say the least that Brandes repeatedly employs
                the word “aristocrat” as an ostensibly positive designation for a certain spiritual
                disposition, coupling it with the concepts of “radicalism” and “revolutionary.” This
                tendency becomes still clearer in the following pages, in which Brandes’
                characterization of Heine’s position threatens to detach itself from its object,
                becoming the point of departure for a more general critique of culture. Among other
                things Heine does not believe that “the philistine ideals of average Bildung” can
                lead to freedom, and he therefore rejects all forms of mediocrity, “including the
                liberal and republican forms, as the enemy of the great personality and of freedom”
                (Brandes 1890a:163-4). For Heine feared nothing other than “a life without beauty
                and especially a life without greatness, with equality of mediocrity as a religion,
                with hatred of genius and of the seekers and of those who openly reject the belief
                that Nazarene asceticism is the only actual form of morality. What he equally
                rejected was the society he knew, governed by a clergy devoid of spirit and an
                aristocracy devoid of refinement, and thus the society he had foreseen, consisting
                of emancipated slave souls who had only revolted against the obsequiousness that was
                their nature, in order to give reign to the enviousness that remains at the core of
                all their decency” (Brandes 1890a:165).</p>
            <p>As has been indicated, it is possible to locate tendencies pointing in this direction
                already in <em>Emigrant Literature</em>, the Mill-inspired remark on the tension
                between the great personality and the tyranny of public opinion serving as an
                example. What clearly distinguishes the later formulation from similar sentiments
                expressed in the first volume is that the emancipatory program of enlightenment of
                1871 has faded entirely into the background in favor of an unconcealed fascination
                with the great personality. Whereas freedom in <em>Emigrant Literature</em> was
                first and foremost tied to liberal ideas and civil rights, there is now more obscure
                talk of “the greater freedom” that is plainly threatened by the lesser liberal
                freedom. Taken as a more general determination of the relationship between political
                and “intellectual” freedom, Brandes openly seems to prefer the latter at the expense
                of the former, in so far as it can be measured in the degree of freedom for the
                individual: the authentic, true freedom is aristocratic freedom, which must
                necessarily be reserved for the few. In the course of the civilizing process the
                average person has however raised himself up over his natural instincts
                (“obsequiousness”) and through resentment and envy of the great personalities
                imposed a political-liberal understanding of freedom, which views the greater
                freedom as illegitimate and propagates the equality of all people.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, passages such as this, right down to the level of the wording, bear the
                mark of the fact that the work on Heine occurred at the same time that Brandes was
                reading and beginning to correspond with Nietzsche (Brandes 1966:439-79). What
                particularly drew Brandes to Nietzsche was precisely the idea that the welfare of
                the majority – the utilitarian credo of “the greatest happiness for the greatest
                number” – could not be the purpose of history, which on the contrary could only
                consist of bringing forth “individual great men” (Brandes 1889:574). Not only had
                such ideas strengthened Brandes in the reflections he himself had worked out on this
                question, they also – as not the least is evident in the introductory chapter on
                Heine in <em>Young Germany</em> – provided him with a conceptual unity and a
                speculative historical-philosophical framework that went far beyond the well-known
                Hegelian construct. “Slave morality,” ressentiment as the driving force of history,
                Caesarism, the cultivated ruling caste, the “cultural philistine,” and the last man
                – all this and more Brandes found in Nietzsche, and it was put to use in the
                characterization of Heine, who in the effective merging of radicalism and
                aristocracy is presented as the forerunner of Nietzsche’s aristocratic
                radicalism.</p>
            <p>This is not to say that there is no evidence in support of Brandes’ reading of Heine,
                and even less that it is the views of Nietzsche or for that matter Brandes that
                function as the point of reference in this account of Heine’s political views. Yet
                if we look at some of the passages in Heine that presumably form the basis for
                Brandes’ paraphrase, it nevertheless becomes clear that Heine’s undeniable
                distinction between “intellect” and politics is of a quite different nature than
                that presented by Brandes. Among other places this illustrated by the foreword to
                the French edition of Lutetia from 1855, a collection of articles and reportage
                Heine write for the <em>Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung</em> Here he explains among
                other things that when he in these articles “in the most anguished and concerned
                tone” foresaw a golden future for the socialists or – “to call the horror by its
                proper name” (Heine 1988,8:166) [pour nommer le monstre par son vrai nom, les
                communists] – the communists, he was in no manner playing to the gallery. A longer
                citation is required to understand Heine’s argumentation: “in reality I look only
                with fear and horror at the time when these obscure iconoclasts will come to power:
                with their bare fists they will smash all the marble images of my beloved world of
                art, they destroy all the fantastical curiosities the poet admires so dearly; they
                fell my laurel groves and make them into potato fields . . . the roses, the useless
                nightingale couple they do no better; the nightingales, those useless singers, are
                driven away, and woe! my <em>Buch der Lieder</em> will be used by the merchant as a
                cornet to be filled with coffee or snuff for the old ladies of the future. – Woe!
                All this I foresee, and I am seized with an unspeakable sorrow at the thought of the
                defeat with which communism threatens my poems and the entire old world order along
                with them – And still I frankly confess this thought . . . a supernatural power over
                my mind against which I cannot defend myself . . . a dreadful syllogism plagues me,
                and I cannot deny its premise: ‘that all human beings have the right to eat,’ such
                that I must also accept all its consequences . . . and in the end I am seized a
                desperate magnanimity and cry out . . . blessed be the grocer who one day makes my
                poems into cornets and fills them with coffee and snuff for the poor old grandmas,
                who in the unjust world of today must do without such refreshments – <em>fiat
                    justitia, pereat mundus</em>! [Let justice be done, though the world will
                perish] (Heine 1988:167) [[En effet, ce n'est qu'avec horreur et effroi que je pense
                à l'époque où ces sombres iconoclastes parviendront à la domination: de leurs mains
                calleuses ils briseront sans merci toutes les statues de marbre si chères á mon
                coeur; ils fracasseront toutes ces babioles et fanfreluches fantastiques de l'art,
                qu'aimait tant le poëte; ils détruiront mes bois de lauriers et y planteront des
                pommes de terre; [...] les roses, ces oisives fiancées des rossignols, auront le

                ou du tabac à priser pour les vieilles femmes de l'avenir. Hélas! je prévois tout
                cela, et je suis saisi d'une indicible tristesse en pensant à la ruine dont menace
                mes vers, qui périront avec tout l'ancien. Et pourtant, je l'avoue avec franchise,
                ce même communisme, exerce sur mon âme un charme dont je ne puis me défendre; [...]
                Un terrible syllogisme me tient ensorcelé, et si je ne puis réfuter cette prémisse:

                toutes ses conséquences [...] et à la fin un désespoir généreux s'empare de mon
                coeur et je m'écrie: [...] Et béni soit l'épicier qui un jour confectionnera avec
                mes poésies des cornets où il versera du café et du tabac pour les pauvres 18 bonnes
                vieilles qui, dans notre monde actuel de l'injustice, ont peut-être dû se passer
                d'un pareil agrément – <em>fiat justitia, pereat mundus</em>!"]</p>
            <p>As always with Heine, it is easy to overlook the balance in the subtle tripwires of
                the irony, yet the point of view is without a doubt sincerely meant. Presented with
                the choice between art for the privileged few and welfare for the many one must be
                incredibly hard-hearted to feel the smallest measure of moral compulsion to choose
                the former. The content of the discord expressed by Heine here thus may be likened
                to the contradiction Brandes poses between the liberal-political and aristocratic
                conceptions of freedom, yet the particular weight placed on each side is an entirely
                different matter. Heine’s discussion of the problem transposes classical theodicy
                from theology to art: how can art be justified in a world in which hunger and need
                are the norm for the majority of people? His answer is precisely that it cannot, if
                a moral measuring stick is employed. Nietzsche’s answer to the same question is as
                is well-known” “only as an aesthetic phenomenon is existence and the world eternally
                justified (Nietzsche 1972:148) [dass nur al sein aesthetisches Phänomen das Dasein
                und die Welt gerechfertigt erscheint]. Whereas Heine allows himself to be swayed by
                the “slave army of the starving,” Nietzsche views its existence as perhaps tragic,
                although just as much an inescapable condition of existence, on which art alone can
                impart meaning.</p>
            <p>Brandes’ own leanings on this issue at this time is clear, for in his reckoning there
                are few traces of Heine’s scruples. The social question is more or less written out
                of the authorship and replaced with a Nietzschean philosophy of art, contemptuous of
                the base, ressentiment-fueled slave morality that stands in the way of great art and
                its deliverers. The Danish philosopher Harald Høffding, interestingly enough,
                reached a similar conclusion, when in 1889 he registered a protest against Brandes’
                portrait of Nietzsche in the famous essay on <em>Aristocratic Radicalism</em>.
                Høffding argued that Brandes’ presentation of the philosopher was rather too
                sympathetic, and that the critic’s “purely aesthetic tendency” led to “an
                overestimation of the great men” at the expense of the democratic welfare principal,
                which “prohibits the forgetting of the suffering of the many in favor of the
                enjoyment of the few” (Høffding 1889:864).</p>
            <p>Close examination of the central commentaries on Börne and Heine in <em>Young
                    Germany</em> reveals that the tendency is thus a clear upgrading of the
                apolitical “spirit” and the great personalities at the expense of the political
                engagement that otherwise must be said to be characteristic of the movement. When
                Brandes weighs Börne and finds him wanting, the measuring stick is the “artistic
                sensibility,” for which Börne had no greater respect than he did for Goethe as an
                authority. Heine, in contrast, quite graciously escapes being judged against “the
                great style of the past,” even though he hardly warrants comparison to Goethe in all
                respects: “in the comparison we frequently see him come up short, though not all too
                rarely rising up to an almost equivalent status. It is honor enough for him that it
                is possible and occasionally necessary to compare him to Goethe” (Brandes
                1890a:237). With respect to Heine in and of himself, it is in the meantime
                conspicuous how little his political engagement figures in Brandes’ evaluation of
                the authorship. Now and then it almost seems as if he is more concerned with
                defending the antidemocratic and intellectual aristocratic version of Heine than
                presenting him as a part of the Young Germany movement.</p>
            <p>Yet what blinds him in one eye sharpens the other. While his contemporaries found it
                difficult to see in Heine other than his critique of Prussia and his ironic and
                risqué poetry, Brandes exhibits a penetrating gaze for other sides of the authorship
                that not infrequently point to literary historical connections that previously had
                been neglected. This is perhaps best expressed in the brilliant excursus on the
                image of Napoleon in German literature, in which Brandes, precisely because of his
                strong focus on “the great personality in general,” is able to show that Heine’s
                admiration for Napoleon is far from being the “isolated event in the German
                literature of the century” his contemporaries had made it into, but on the contrary
                was part of a long tradition stretching from the Weimar Classicist author Christoph
                Martin Wieland through Goethe, Schiller, Hegel, and the Dane Jens Baggesen.</p>
            <p>Chapters like this one, which both break with customary understandings of and clichés
                about Heine and place him in a novel literary historical context, demonstrate what
                the unbiased comparatist can accomplish, when he was at his best.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>a. Danish and Nordic Reception</h2>
                <p>“The Danish edition fell to the earth like a stain. Throughout the year hardly a
                    paper mentioned it” (Brandes 1908:285). The disappointment is still palpable
                    when Brandes mentions the paltry discussion provoked by <em>Young Germany</em>
                    in his memoirs, and the author was not alone in resenting the dearth of reviews.
                    When Brandes’ faithful squire Sophus Schandorph discussed the volume in June
                    1891 in the journal <em>Tilskueren</em>, he began by lamenting the newspapers’
                    neglect of Brandes: “rarely do we see Dr. Brandes’ great books reviewed. If his
                    many enemies had been able to do him harm, they would hardly have denied
                    themselves the joy in doing so, and if his friends had been able to say
                    something of significance on the occasion of his masterwork, they would surely
                    also have done so (Schandorph 1891:420). The explanation for the fact that
                    neither friend nor enemy had taken up the pen, according to Schandorph, must be
                    that he is too much to handle for them. Friends remained silent out of
                    self-consciousness and awe, enemies because they could not find anything to
                    criticize. Brandes “towers so far above everyone here in this country” that only
                    the “poor devils” who basely occupied themselves with fact checking or pettily
                    latched onto the fact that “Brandes has not used quotation marks to a
                    significant degree” dared to write about his masterwork (Ibid).</p>
                <p>Schandorph’s explanation must naturally be taken with a grain of salt, for in his
                    own words he is “an affectionate admirer and faithful friend of the author”
                    (Ibid), as is attested to excess in the twenty-five pages of his uncritical and
                    admiring summary of <em>Young Germany</em>. On the other hand it illustrates
                    quite clearly how polarized the reception of Brandes was, and why critics of a
                    bourgeois persuasion in some instances would rather refrain from saying
                    something about Brandes in general other than either reviewing his books
                    favorably or with nuance. In spite of everything it demanded courage to break
                    with consensus in the ideological conflict between Brandes’ allies and
                    opponents. A prominent example of one who lacked such courage was Fr. Winkel
                    Horn, reviewer at <em>Berlingske Tidende</em>, who at the request of Schandorph
                    wrote to Brandes, indicating that while he admired his greatness, circumstances
                    prevented him from expressing it publicly (Knudsen 1994:388). This is doubtless
                    also the reason why a part of the contemporary criticism comes across as
                    polarized and stereotypical. One was either on team Brandes and followed him
                    through thick and thin like his friends Schandorph and Oscar Levertin, each of
                    whom shared virtually all of Brandes’ political views and aesthetic
                    idiosyncrasies, or, on the opposing side, categorically dismissed the work for
                    political, religious or other reasons. An example of the latter is the review in
                    the Swedish newspaper <em>Post- och Inrikes Tidningar</em>; <em>Young
                        Germany</em> only seems to strengthen the deeply hostile reviewer’s sense
                    that Brandes agitates for a through and through negative “work of destruction
                    directed at the family, religion and thus the entirety of the orderly life of
                    the state.”</p>
                <p>More interesting are the reviews that at least attempt to take the critical task
                    seriously. This is partially the case in the review published in the Norwegian
                    paper <em>Morgenbladet</em>, whose anonymous author bravely tries to find a
                    balance between criticism and praise, and who is alone among Scandinavian
                    reviewers in recognizing that Nietzsche can play a role in the “characterization
                    of Heine that is in many respects highly interesting . . . it is as if Brandes
                    here tests out the correctness of the Nietzschean theory of the overman.” A tad
                    more critical is the acronym H-n L in his review in Swedish
                    <em>Aftonbladet</em>, which begins with an acute, yet not hostile
                    characterization of Brandes, who is said to be just as all-encompassing in his
                    presentation of the material as he is one-sided in his evaluation and judgement
                    of it. This is followed be a severe critique of Brandes’ treatment of especially
                    Heine and Börne, while other (and more peripheral) sections of the volume are
                    deemed successful. This har undoubtedly been painful for Brandes to read.
                    Finally, there are discussions that first and foremost serve to use the
                    publication as an occasion to cast a glance back over the entirety of Main
                    Currents and to incorporate the final volume into the whole composition. This is
                    the case with Johannes Jørgensen’s commentary on the front page of
                        <em>Kjøbenhavns Børs-Tidende</em>, which prefaces its discussion of
                        <em>Young Germany</em> with a lengthy chronological review of the first five
                    volumes. The tone is strikingly respectful, yet not actually evaluative. It is
                    moreover conspicuous that the political-ideological tendentiousness of <em>Main
                        Currents</em> is not so much as mentioned, and that it is actually not
                    certain whether it is Brandes or Jørgensen himself who has been bewitched by
                    “the wondrous fairytale night of German Romanticism.”</p>
                <p>If there was not much encouragement in the reviews of the daily papers, Brandes
                    could find compensation in the private letters he received. Already in December
                    of 1890, Jonas Lie wrote from Paris: “for more than a month now, I have had for
                    my refreshment your latest splendid work, <em>Young Germany</em>, – it has been my only
                    reading material while I, finished with <em>my</em> book, exhausted, have waged
                    my hopeless struggle to sweep away all the various projects I have promised to
                    complete” (Brandes 1939:448). Lie remembers to emphasize Heine and Börne,
                    thanking the author for “this superb crowning touch on a grandly and gloriously
                    executed work of intellect.” No less enthusiastic was the reaction from
                    Alexander Kielland in Norway, who bemoans that he has only now (August 1891)
                    read the book, yet on the other hand can play a trump card: “it is with sorrow
                    that one closes such a book, that it did not last longer, – that one does not
                    always have such a work before himself. I do not think you have ever written
                    anything better . . .” (Brandes 1939:365). He also emphasizes the portrait of
                    Heine: “what you write about Heine in your book is manna for my soul . . you
                    manage to say about Heine what should be said by someone who has correctly
                    understood and evaluated him” (Brandes 1939:366). As his response to Kielland
                    divulges, these words were cold comfort to Brandes: “many thanks to you for your
                    heartening words on my old book, which otherwise has not been blessed with a
                    strong reception and has sold perhaps five hundred copies, about which I am
                    hardly giddy” (Brandes 1939:367).</p>

                <h2>b. Reception in Germany</h2>
                <p>While the majority of the Scandinavian critics often directly acknowledged that
                    they did not know much about the authors of Young Germany and thus concentrated
                    on the sections of the volume about which they knew something beforehand (Heine,
                    Goethe), and otherwise had to trust in Brandes’ review of the material, the
                    German criticism unsurprisingly is distinguished by a greater knowledge of the
                    both the period and the common literary historical treatments of it. In the
                    longer reviews of the volume critics often reference other narrative accounts,
                    just as they comment on Brandes’ weighing of the material and his grasp of it.
                    Minority views and idiosyncrasies are not at all a rarity in the German
                    criticism, but rarely do they revolve around Brandes’ person or
                    political-ideological questions. What actually plays a significant role is
                    Brandes’ relation to contemporary positivistic literary historical writing. A
                    majority of the reviewers discuss the remarkable fact that Brandes seems to have
                    a much wider appeal than contemporary German literary historical writing, and
                    most explain this by noting that he is a literary critic and aestheticist rather
                    than a literary historian and philologist. Some see this as a problem and
                    criticize the looser form and “salon style” (S. Lublinski), the missing
                    references and the careless citation practice, which in certain instances are
                    accompanied by more or less well-founded accusations of plagiarism (A. Gerhard).
                    Others see the fact that Brandes writes in a manner accessible to
                    non-specialists as itself a great service: “it feels like a refreshing bath when
                    one comes from the swamp official literary history” [Sie wirkt wie ein
                    erfrischendes Bad, wenn man aus den Sümpfen der offiziellen Literaturhistore
                    herkommt], writes Franz Mehring in <em>Die neue Zeit</em>, while Moritz Necker
                    asserts in <em>Neue Freie Presse</em> that Brandes is “the only literary critic
                    who enjoys a measure of authority and popularity among the more educated German
                    public” [der einzige literarische Kritiker ist, der sich bei dem großeren
                    Publicum der Gebildeten Deutschland seiner gewissen Autorität und Beliebtheit
                    erfreut].</p>
                <p>Interestingly enough, we sense behind such evaluations the contours of a conflict
                    over values that was marked in German intellectual circles from the beginning of
                    the 1890s all the way through to the interwar years. The conflict was fueled by
                    the challenge of <em>lebensphilosophie</em> to the established scientific
                    culture, which in the wake of Nietzsche’s critique of historicism was charged
                    with being unproductive and barren, lost in irrelevant questions of details, and
                    against its intentions leading to the collapse of values in favor of creating
                    healthy human beings and contributing to a genuine form of education. Brandes
                    was naturally familiar with this discussion from both Nietzsche and his vulgar
                    epigone Julius Langbehn, whose immensely influential <em>Rembrandt als
                        Erzieher</em> (1890), published anonymously under the name of “a German,”
                    had been reviewed by Brandes in the first volume of <em>Freie Bühne</em>
                    (Brandes 1890b) – and astoundingly favorably at that, in light of is national
                    chauvinistic tendencies and its anti-academic radicalism (“the professor is the
                    German national disease”) (Langbehn 1890:94) [Der Professor ist die Deutsche
                    Nationalkrankheit]. Yet with respect to the critique of institutions and of
                    science formulated by <em>lebensphilosophie</em>, Brandes did not have a dog in
                    the fight. As in the Scandinavian reception, he functioned more as a catalyst in
                    an already ongoing <em>Weltanschauung</em> debate, if indeed the content of such
                    in Germany was something else and further less tied to his own person.</p>
                <p>Despite these differences between the Scandinavian and German receptions of
                        <em>Young Germany</em>, interest was however concentrated chiefly on Börne
                    and Heine. For Ludwig Geiger, who reviewed the final volume of <em>Main
                        Currents</em> over many pages in the weekly <em>Die Nation</em>, the
                    portrait of Heine is especially successful. According to the reviewer, Brandes
                    with great virtuosity succeeds in saying something new about an authorship
                    believed to have been exhaustively described. He is however less enthusiastic
                    for the rest of the book. Some of this can surely be explained or excused by the
                    lack of homogeneity and the thrown together nature of the material, yet Brandes
                    has clearly also had problems in illuminating and arranging it, says Geiger. On
                    the other hand he does not see it as a problem that the other Young Germany
                    authors (Gutzkow, Laube, Mundt, Wienbarg) are treated relatively quickly: “the
                    works of these men . . . are entirely passé for us, and even a master like
                    Brandes cannot manage to bring these colorless figures to life” (Geiger
                    1890-1:633) [Die Werke jener Männer . . . sind für uns völlig abgethan und
                    selbst ein Meister wie Brandes vermag aus diesen Schemen kein Leben zu
                    erwecken]. For Geiger the problem is rather in the exclusions (for example,
                    Grillparzer) and moreover the more or less peripheral material included (for
                    example the chapter on neutral literature). That the review is so positive is
                    therefore due wholly to the chapters on Heine and Börne, which – as Geiger point
                    out – take up half the book. In line with Geiger, yet still more effusive, is
                    Wilhelm Bölsche, who in his review, published in the same volume of <em>Freie
                        Bühne</em> as Brandes’ aforementioned review of <em>Rembrandt als
                        Erzieher</em>, likewise asserts that “this is a <em>book about Heine</em>”
                    (Bölsche 1890:1179) [das ist eine <em>Buch über Heine</em>], and for the same
                    reason does not find it necessary to comment on the other sections. Bölsche
                    begins with general observations on the status of Heine in Imperial Germany,
                    declaring his agreement with Brandes’ explanation of the contemporary
                    marginalization of Heine and expressing only words of praise for his
                    rehabilitation, which is described as a salutatory act of the politics of memory
                    in an age incapable of erecting a monument to the poet in the city of his birth.
                    Interestingly enough, Bölsche further identifies Brandes’ analysis of Heine’s
                    aristocratic radicalism as particularly successful – “the real key” to unlocking
                    the political Heine – and points out that Nietzsche presumably has been a
                    determining factor in this interpretation (Bölsche 1890:1180).</p>
                <p>In the German criticism Brandes could not entirely escape being reminded of his
                    Scandinavian detractors and enemies. Among the reviewers of <em>Young
                        Germany</em> we thus also encounter Laura Marholm, Brandes’ earlier
                    translator and confidant who had married Ola Hansson and now from the artist
                    colony of Friedrichshagen outside Berlin took part in her husband’s effort to
                    contend with Brandes as the foremost mediator of Scandinavian literature in
                    Germany. Marholm begins her text – more essay than review – with a longer
                    recollection of her childhood reading of Gutzkow’s novels that leads into an
                    interesting diagnosis of the present era (the “age of nervousness”), before at
                    last discussing two new books about Young Germany, one of which is Brandes’. And
                    as expected she has little favorable to say about the author or the actual book,
                    which is viciously characterized as a book for Danes and other foreigners who
                    have no knowledge of German literature and culture, written by a “the demagogue
                    among the literary historians” (Marholm 1893:205) [der Demagog unter den
                    Literaturhistorikern], who perhaps once had firsthand knowledge of the material,
                    but after moving back to Denmark no longer has his finger on the pulse.
                    Thereafter is passed the merciless verdict: “Perhaps an acute and profound
                    psychological divination like that known to us from Frenchman such as Taine and
                    Bourget could have remedied these necessary deficiencies, but Brandes proceeds
                    all too anecdotally all too superficially” (Marholm 1893:207) [Ueber diese
                    nothgedrungenen Mängel hätteeine sehr feine und tiefe psychologische Divination
                    hinweghelfen können, wie die Franzosen, wie Taine und Bourget sie haben, aber
                    auf diesem Gebiet arbeitet Brandes allzusehr anekdotisch und auf der
                    Oberfläche]. As if to add insult to injury there follows an especially laudatory
                    discussion of Johannes Prölß’s <em>Young Germany</em> from 1892, which according
                    to Marholm distinguishes itself by being everything Brandes’ book is not: “this
                    is not a book that is a reflection of its author, but a book that wholly strives
                    to make its contents comprehensible . . . It is a very German book in technique
                    and presentation, and thereby it stands in the greatest imaginable contrast to
                    Brandes’ French schooling” (Marholm 1893:207) [Es ist kein Buch, das seinen
                    Verfasser spiegelt, sondern ein Buch, das ganz von dem Bestreben ausgeht, seinen
                    Inhalt durchsichtig zu ansehen . . . Es ist ein sehr deutsches Buch in Technik
                    und Darstellung, und daruch steht es im starken Gegensatz zu Brandes’
                    französicher Schulung]. Incidentally the laurel-wreathed Prölß was naturally
                    aware of Brandes’ narrative, which is quite briefly discussed in the
                    introduction to his book, but does not seem to have played any role in his own
                    presentation.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>c. The Afterlife of <em>Young Germany</em></h2>
                <p>Not much indicates that later literary historians should have been more
                    influenced by Brandes’ presentation of Young Germany than that of Prölß. Many
                    explanations can be provided for this, but presumably most important is the
                    already noted circumstance that literary criticism and, according to its own
                    understanding, strictly scientific literary history, did not have much to do
                    with each other in Germany at this time, and that Brandes was always placed
                    within the former group. Even though Brandes and Wilhelm Scherer, professor at
                    the University of Berlin and possibly the highest profile positivistic literary
                    historian of the era, held each other in high esteem, shared a passionate
                    interest in Goethe and further associated with one another while Brandes lived
                    in Berlin, they were far apart in their activities as representatives of on the
                    one hand philologically- and positivistically-oriented literary history and on
                    the other aesthetic literary criticism – even if the distance between them was
                    understand to be much shorter in Danish rather than German eyes. On this point
                    Prölß is aligned with Scherer, when despite complementing Brandes on his
                    “brilliantly written character analyses” [geistvoll geschriebene
                    Charakteranalysen] he makes short work of Brandes’ book, dismissing it as
                    insufficiently based in source material (lacking in “scrupulous knowledge of the
                    sources and the records”) [die genaue Kenntnis der Quellen und Akten] and
                    moreover as subordinated to a political-ideological tendentiousness [“the
                    aggregate purpose of the whole”] (Prölß 1892:4-5) [Totalzweck des Ganzen]. Thus
                    Brandes was so to speak set aside and no further discussion was required.</p>
                <p>Nonetheless it is also necessary here to distinguish between volume six as a
                    unified historiographic presentation of Young Germany and its individual
                    sections, especially the chapters on Heine. While Brandes’ literary
                    historiographic scheme does not seem to have made an impact on literary history,
                    his portrait of Heine has fared better in more recent scholarship on the German
                    reception of the poet. This is due on the one hand to his more nuanced
                    presentation of the conflict between Börne and Heine as well as his defense of
                    Heine in that conflict, which is described as “unusual” and “diverging from
                    German criticism” (Hohendahl 2008:139-40) [ungewöhnlich . . . von der deutschen
                    Kritik abweichend], and on the other for his refusal to take part in the almost
                    unanimous branding of Heine as a “traitor” after 1848, instead insisting that
                    Heine was no less patriotic than his enemies. It is not surprising that Brandes,
                    who himself was often attacked for being unpatriotic, had a sharp eye for
                    it.</p>
                <p>Finally, the same author points out that Brandes’ portrait of Heine by all
                    accounts resonated immensely with Heinrich Mann, who in reference to <em>Young
                    Germany</em> in 1892 noted that Heine’s modernity first and foremost consisted of his
                    “psychological complexity” (Hohendahl 2008:203) [psychologische Komplexität]. As
                    an admirer of the French Enlightenment tradition and republicanism, neither was
                    it probably difficult for him to affirm Brandes’ presentation of the world
                    citizen Heine, his critique of German Romanticism, his anticlericalism and his
                    proud individualism – all of which were later incorporated into Heinrich Mann’s
                    own portrait of Heine in <em>Geist und Tat</em> (1910). Because he does not actually
                    refer to Brandes in this work, it remains difficult to determine how much
                    Heinrich Mann is in debt to Brandes’ understanding of Heine. On the other hand
                    there is no doubt that Heine came to play an important role in the determination
                    of the aesthetic and political views of both Heinrich and Thomas Mann, just as
                    he became a central historical and political point of contention in the famous
                    fratricidal conflict between German culture and French civilization that
                    manifested itself in the First World War, and which found concentrated
                    expression in the question of the character of Heine’s patriotism and modernity.
                    But that is another story, in which Brandes is only indirectly involved.</p>

                <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
                <p>The task of giving a connected account of the German Romantic School is, for a
                    Dane, an arduous and disheartening one. In the first place, the subject is
                    overwhelmingly vast; in the second, it has been treated again and again by
                    German writers; and, lastly, these writers, in their division of labour, have
                    entered so learnedly into every detail, that it is impossible for a foreigner,
                    one, moreover, to whom the sources are not always accessible, to compete with
                    them in exhaustive knowledge. From their childhood they have been familiar with
                    a literature with which he first makes acquaintance at an age when assimilation,
                    in any quantity, has become a much more difficult process. What the foreigner
                    must rely on is, partly the decision with which he takes up and maintains his
                    personal standpoint, partly the possibility that he may display qualities which
                    are not characteristic of the native author. Such a quality in the case in point
                    is the artistic faculty, the faculty, I mean, of representation, of
                    externalisation. The German nature is so intense and profound that this faculty
                    is comparatively rare. The foreigner has, moreover, this advantage over the
                    native, that it is easier for him to detect the mark of race--that in the German
                    author which stamps him as a German. The German critic is too apt to consider
                    "German" synonymous with "human being," for the reason that the human beings he
                    deals with are almost always Germans. The foreigner is struck by characteristics
                    which are overlooked by the native, sometimes because he is so accustomed to
                    them, more frequently because he himself possesses them.</p>
                <p>There are many works to be criticised and classified, many personalities to
                    describe. My aim will be to present these personalities and works in as firm and
                    sharp outline as possible, and, without giving undue attention to detail, to
                    throw light upon the whole in such a manner that its principal features will
                    stand out and arrest the eye. I shall endeavour, on the one hand, to treat the
                    history of literature as humanly as possible, to go as deep down as I can, to
                    seize upon the remotest, innermost psychological movements which prepared for
                    and produced the various literary phenomena; and on the other hand, I shall try
                    to present the result in as plastic and tangible a form as possible. If I can
                    succeed in giving shape, clear and accurate, to the hidden feeling, the idea,
                    which everywhere underlies the literary phenomenon, my task will be
                    accomplished. By preference, I shall always, when possible, embody the abstract
                    in the personal.</p>
                <p>First and foremost, therefore, I everywhere trace the connection between
                    literature and life. This is at once proved by the fact that, whereas earlier
                    Danish literary controversies (that between Heiberg and Hauch, for example, or
                    even the famous one between Baggesen and Oehlenschläger) were kept entirely
                    within the domain of literature and dealt exclusively with literary principles,
                    the controversy aroused by the first volume of this work has entailed, quite as
                    much from the nature of the work as from the irrationality of its opponents, the
                    discussion of a multitude of moral, social, and religious questions. The Danish
                    reaction, feeling itself to be akin to the one I am about to depict and unmask,
                    has attempted to suppress the movement which it recognised to be antagonistic to
                    itself--but so far with little prospect of success. A French proverb says: _Nul
                    prince n'a tué son successeur._</p>
                <p>When, however, the connection between literature and life is thus emphasised, the
                    delineations and interpretations of men and their books by no means produce what
                    we may call drawing-room history of literature. I go down to the foundations of
                    real life, and show how the emotions which find their expression in literature
                    arise in the human heart. And this same human heart is no still pool, no idyllic
                    mountain lake. It is an ocean, with submarine vegetation and terrible
                    inhabitants. Drawing-room history of literature, like drawing-room poetry, sees
                    in human life a drawing-room, a decorated ball-room--the furniture and the
                    people alike polished, the brilliant illumination excluding all possibility of
                    dark corners. Let those who choose to do so look at things thus; it is not my
                    point of view. Just as the botanist must handle nettles as well as roses, so the
                    student of literature must accustom himself to look, with the unflinching gaze
                    of the naturalist or the physician, upon all the forms taken by human nature, in
                    their diversity and their inward affinity. It makes the plant neither more nor
                    less interesting that it smells sweet or stings; but the dispassionate interest
                    of the botanist is often accompanied by the purely human pleasure in the beauty
                    of the flower.</p>
                <p>As I follow the more important literary movements from country to country,
                    studying their psychology, I attempt to condense the fluid material by showing
                    how, from time to time, it crystallises into one or other definite and
                    intelligible type. The attempt is attended with extraordinary difficulty in this
                    particular period of German literature, from the fact that the chief
                    characteristic of the period is an absence of distinctly typical forms. This
                    literature is not plastic; it is musical. French Romanticism produces clearly
                    defined figures; the ideal of German Romanticism is not a figure, but a melody,
                    not definite form, but infinite aspiration. Is it obliged to name the object of
                    its longing? It designates it by such terms as "ein geheimes Wort," "eine blaue
                    Blume," "der Zauber der Waldeinsamkeit" (a mystic word--a blue flower--the magic
                    of the lonely woods). These expressions are, however, definitions of moods, and
                    each mood has a corresponding psychological condition, my task is to trace back
                    each mood, emotion, or longing to the group of psychological conditions to which
                    it belongs. This group in combination constitutes a soul; and such a soul, with
                    strongly marked individuality, represents in literature the many who were unable
                    to depict their own character, but who recognised it when thus placed before
                    them. I may possibly succeed in proving that the type does not escape us because
                    the author may have chosen to paint landscape after landscape in place of
                    delineating characteristic personalities, or because he confounds literature
                    with music to the extent of at last entitling his poems simply _Allegro_ or
                    _Rondo_; but that, on the contrary, the distinctly peculiar qualities of these
                    landscapes and the character of this word-music are symptomatic of a
                    psychological condition which may be determined with considerable accuracy.</p>
                <p>In the general introduction to this work I have sketched the plan which I have
                    proposed to myself. It is my intention to describe the first great literary
                    movement of the century, the germinating and growing reaction, first elucidating
                    its nature, then following it to its climax. Afterwards I shall show how this
                    reaction was met by a breeze of liberalism blowing from the eighteenth century,
                    which swells into a gale and sweeps away all opposition. Not that the liberal
                    views of the nineteenth century are ever identical with those of the eighteenth,
                    or that its literary forms or scientific ideas ever bear the eighteenth century
                    stamp. Neither Voltaire, nor Rousseau, nor Diderot, neither Lessing nor
                    Schiller, neither Hume nor Godwin, rise from the dead; but they are one and all
                    avenged upon their enemies.</p>
                <p>Regarded as a whole, German Romanticism is reaction. Nevertheless, as an
                    intellectual, poetico-philosophical reaction, it contains many germs of new
                    development, unmistakable productions of that spirit of progress which, by
                    remoulding the old, creates the new, and by altering boundaries gains
                    territory.</p>
                <p>The older Romanticists begin, without exception, as the apostles of
                    "enlightenment." They introduce a new tone into German poetry, give their works
                    a new colour, and, in addition to this, revive both the spirit and the substance
                    of the old fairy-tale, Volkslied, and legend. They exercise at first a
                    fertilising influence upon German science; research in the domains of history,
                    ethnography, and jurisprudence, the study of German antiquity, Indian and
                    Greek-Latin philology, and the systems and dreams of the _Naturphilosophie_ all
                    receive their first impulse from Romanticism. They widened the emotional range
                    of German poetry, though the emotions to which they gave expression were more
                    frequently morbid than healthy. As critics, they originally, and with success,
                    aimed at enlarging the spiritual horizon. In their social capacity they vowed
                    undying hatred to all dead conventionality in the relations between the sexes.
                    The best among them in their youth laboured ardently for the intensification of
                    that spiritual life which is based upon a belief in the supernatural. In
                    politics, when not indifferent, they generally began as very theoretical
                    republicans; who, however, in spite of their cosmopolitanism, strove to elevate
                    and strengthen German patriotism.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, their pursuit of all these worthy aims ended in comparative
                    failure. Of all that the German Romanticists produced, little will endure--some
                    masterly translations by A. W. Schlegel, a few of Tieck's productions, a handful
                    of Hardenberg's and another of Eichendorff's lyrics, some of Friedrich
                    Schlegel's essays, a few of Arnim's and Brentano's smaller works, a select
                    number of Hoffmann's tales, and some very remarkable dramas and tales from the
                    pen of that eccentric but real genius, Heinrich von Kleist. The rest of the
                    life-work of the Romanticists has disappeared from the memory of the present
                    generation. Looking back on it from this distance, most of their endeavour seems
                    to have ended in smoke. In the matter of language, with their intangible
                    imagery, their misuse of words in expressing the strange, weird, and mysterious,
                    their archaisms, and their determination to be unintelligible to the ordinary
                    reader, they rather diminished than enriched the poetic vocabulary, rather
                    corrupted than improved literary style. In the domain of poetry, Romanticism
                    ended in hysterical piety and vapouring. In the social domain it occupied itself
                    with only one question, that of the relations between the sexes; and its ideas
                    on this subject were, for the most part, so abnormal and morbidly unhealthy,
                    that most of its passionate blows were dealt in the air. In dealing them, it was
                    not humanity at large that the Romanticists had in view, but a few favoured,
                    aristocratic, artistic natures. In religious matters, these men, whose moral and
                    poetical theories were at first so revolutionary, bowed their necks to the yoke
                    the moment they saw it. And in politics it was they who directed the proceedings
                    of the Congress of Vienna and prepared its manifestoes, abolishing liberty of
                    thought in the interval between a religious festival in St. Stephen's and an
                    oyster supper with Fanny Elsler.</p>
                <p>I shall touch but seldom and briefly upon Danish literature, only now and again
                    piercing in the canvas of the panorama I am unrolling a hole through which the
                    situation in Denmark may be seen. Not that I forget or lose sight of Danish
                    literature. On the contrary, it is ever present with me. Whilst trying to
                    present to my readers the inner history of a foreign literature, I am all the
                    time making indirect contributions to the history of our own. I am painting the
                    background which is required to throw its characteristics into relief. I am
                    working at the foundation upon which, according to my conviction, the history of
                    modern Danish literature rests. My method may be indirect, but it is the more
                    thorough for that. I should like, however, in a few words, to indicate the
                    general conclusion to which a comparison between Danish and foreign literature
                    at this period has led me.</p>
                <p>The relative positions of Germany and Denmark may be defined as follows: German
                    literature is at this period comparatively original in its aims and its
                    productions; Danish literature either continues the working out of a peculiarly
                    Scandinavian vein, or builds upon German foundations. The Danish authors have,
                    as a rule, read and assimilated the German; the German authors have neither read
                    nor been in any way influenced by the Danes. Steffens, through whom we receive
                    the impetus from Germany, is the devoted disciple of Schelling. Witness the
                    following passage from one of his letters to that philosopher: "I am your pupil,
                    absolutely and entirely your pupil. All that I produce was originally yours.
                    This is no passing feeling; it is my firm conviction that such is the case, and
                    I do not think the less of myself for it. Therefore, when once I have produced a
                    really great work which I should gladly call mine, I shall, as soon as it has
                    been recognised, publicly, enthusiastically, proclaim you to be my teacher, and
                    hand over to you my laurel wreath."[1]</p>
                <p>In German literature there is more life, in the corresponding Danish literature
                    more art. It is Germany which produces, which unearths, the material. That
                    literature of which Romanticism is the first development, lives and moves and
                    revels in intense emotions, struggles with problems, creates forms which it
                    dashes to pieces again. Danish literature takes German material and ideas,
                    instinct with life, and often succeeds in moulding them more artistically,
                    giving them clearer expression than their German producers do. (Note, for
                    example, the case of Tieck and Heiberg.) The Danes apply and remodel, or they
                    embody kindred ideas in more favourable and more plastic material, such, or
                    instance, as that provided by the Scandinavian mythology and legends.</p>
                <p>The result, as I have elsewhere shown, is that Romanticism acquired more lucidity
                    and clearer contours on Danish soil. It became less a thing of the night; it
                    ventured, veiled, into the light of the sun. It felt that it had come to a
                    sedate, sober-minded people, a people who were not yet quite sure that moonlight
                    was not unnatural and sentimental. It came up from the deep mine shafts from
                    which Novalis had been the first to conjure it, and, with Oehlenschläger's
                    Vaulundur, hammered on the mountain-side till the mountain burst open and laid
                    all its treasures bare to the light of day. It felt that it had come to another,
                    a more serene and idyllic clime; it shook off all its weirdness; its thick,
                    shapeless mists condensed into slender river nymphs; it forgot the Harz and the
                    Blocksberg, and took up its abode one beautiful Midsummer Eve in the Deer Park
                    near Copenhagen.[2]</p>
                <p>_Aladdin_ is a finer and more intelligible literary work than Tieck's _Kaiser
                    Oktavianus_, but Oehlenschläger could not deny that _Aladdin_ would never have
                    been written if _Oktavianus_ had not been in existence. Heiberg's _Julespög og
                    Nytaarslöjer_ is to the full as witty as Tieck's Aristophanic satires, but the
                    whole idea--the play within the play, the literary satire, and the blending of
                    the sentimental with the ironical--is borrowed from Tieck, and, what is worse,
                    is only comprehensible from Tieck's standpoint. In short, there is in
                    Oehlenschläger, Hauch, and Heiberg more form than in Novalis, Tieck, and Fr.
                    Schlegel, but less substance--that is to say, less direct connection with real
                    life. German literature has too often formed the connecting link. We Danes have
                    too often refused to occupy ourselves, in literature, with the great problems of
                    life, have simply dismissed them when we could not succeed in giving them
                    correct literary form.</p>
                <p>Looked at from the psychological point of view, the position may be described as
                    follows. The Danish Romantic authors have, generally speaking, been the
                    superiors of the Germans as regards art, their inferiors as regards intellect.
                    As a rule, every production of the German author, however small, though it be
                    formless, weak, nay, actually a failure, yet expresses a whole philosophy of
                    life, and that no fanciful philosophy, but one evolved and matured by personal
                    experience, and stamped with the whole astonishingly many-sided culture which
                    distinguishes the educated German. A poem by Novalis, a tale by Tieck or
                    Hoffmann, or a play by Kleist, contains a poetico-philosophical theory of life;
                    and it is the theory not only of a poet, but of a man. A tragedy by
                    Oehlenschläger again, or a fairy tale by Andersen, or a vaudeville by Hostrup,
                    will almost invariably be distinguished by such distinctly poetical qualities as
                    fancy, feeling, whimsicality, gaiety, youthful freshness and aplomb, but the
                    philosophy is too often as primitive as a child's. Heiberg is almost the only
                    writer in whose works there is any sign of a philosophy based upon science, and
                    acquiring ever more profundity from the experiences of life. Of real development
                    there are often only faint traces. The youthful works of such authors as
                    Oehlenschläger, Winther, and Andersen are as perfect as those of their maturity.
                    Sometimes, as in the case of Oehlenschläger, advancing years produce in the
                    talent a suspicion of corpulence, of unctuousness. Sometimes, as in the case of
                    Paludan-Müller, the ideal grows more and more attenuated. When a change does
                    take place, it rarely signifies that the author has gradually evolved for
                    himself a new philosophy of life; no--after treading the narrow path of poetry
                    for a time, he strikes into one of the two great highroads, either the road of
                    middle-class respectability or the road of orthodox piety. The dressing-gown or
                    the cassock--one or other of these garments almost inevitably supersedes the
                    Spanish cloak of poetic youth.</p>
                <p>It may, then, generally speaking, be asserted that, in those cases where it is
                    possible to compare the German Romanticists with the Danish, the former have the
                    more original philosophy of life, and are greater as personalities, whatever
                    they may be as poets.</p>
                <p>Let us look at the subject from a third point of view. To the Danish authors, as
                    a body, may be attributed the merit of avoiding the fantastic, tasteless
                    extravagances of which the Germans are frequently guilty. The Danes stop in
                    time; they avoid paradox or do not carry it to its logical conclusion; they have
                    the steadiness due to naturally well-balanced minds and naturally phlegmatic
                    dispositions; they are hardly ever indecent, audacious, blasphemous,
                    revolutionary, wildly fantastic, utterly sentimental, utterly unreal, or utterly
                    sensual; they seldom run amuck, they never tilt at the clouds, and they never
                    fall into a well. This is what makes them so popular with their own countrymen.
                    Unerring taste and elegance, such as distinguish Heiberg's poetry and Gade's
                    music, vigorous, healthy originality, such as characterises Oehlenschläger's and
                    Hartmann's best works, will always be prized by Danes as the expression of noble
                    and self-controlled art. What a contrast is presented by the overstrained,
                    extravagant personalities peopling the Romantic hospital of Germany! A
                    phthisical Moravian Brother with the consumptive's sensuality and the
                    consumptive's mystic yearnings--Novalis. A satirical hypochondriac, subject to
                    hallucinations and with morbid leanings to Catholicism--Tieck. A genius,
                    impotent to produce, but with the propensity of genius to revolt and the
                    imperative craving of impotence to subject itself to outward
                    authority--Friedrich Schlegel. A dissipated fantast with the half-insane
                    imagination of the drunkard--Hoffmann. A foolish mystic like Werner, and a
                    genius like the suicide Kleist. Think of Hoffmann, and his pupil, Hans Andersen,
                    and observe how sane, but also how sober and subdued, Andersen appears compared
                    with his first master.</p>
                <p>It is, then, certain that there is more of the quality of harmony among the
                    Danes. And it is easy to understand that those who regard harmony, even when
                    meagre, as the highest quality of art, will inevitably rank the Danish
                    literature of the first decades of this century above the German. It has,
                    however, to a great extent attained to this harmony by means of caution, by lack
                    of artistic courage. The Danish poets never fell, because they never mounted to
                    a height from which there was any danger of falling. They left it to others to
                    ascend Mont Blanc. They escaped breaking their necks, but they never gathered
                    the Alpine flowers which only bloom on the giddy heights or on the brink of
                    precipices. The quality in literature which, it seems to me, we Danes have never
                    sufficiently prized, is boldness, that quality in the author which incites him,
                    regardless of consequences, to give expression to his artistic ideal. The daring
                    development of what is typical in his literary tendency, often constitutes the
                    beauty of his work; or, to put it more plainly, when a literary tendency like
                    Romanticism develops in the direction of pure fancy, that author seems to me the
                    most interesting, who rises to the most daring heights of fantastic
                    extravagance--as, for instance, Hoffmann. The more madly fantastic he is, the
                    finer he is, just as the poplar is finer the taller it is, and the beech finer
                    the more stately and wide-spreading it is. The fineness lies in the daring and
                    vigour with which that which is typical is expressed. He who discovers a new
                    country may, in the course of his explorations, be stranded on a reef. It is an
                    easy matter to avoid the reef and leave the country undiscovered. The Danish
                    Romanticists are never insane like Hoffmann, but neither are they ever dæmonic
                    like him. They lose in thrilling, overpowering life and energy what they gain in
                    lucidity and readableness. They appeal to a greater number and a more varied
                    class of readers, but they do not enthral them. The more vigorous originality
                    alarms the many, but fascinates the few. In Danish Romanticism there is none of
                    Friedrich Schlegel's audacious immorality, but neither is there anything like
                    that spirit of opposition which in him amounts to genius; his ardour melts, and
                    his daring moulds into new and strange shapes, much that we accept as
                    unalterable. Nor do the Danes become Catholic mystics. Protestant orthodoxy in
                    its most petrified form flourishes with us: so do supernaturalism and pietism;
                    and in Grundtvigianism we slide down the inclined plane which leads to
                    Catholicism; but in this matter, as in every other, we never take the final
                    step; we shrink back from the last consequences. The result is that the Danish
                    reaction is far more insidious and covert than the German. Veiling itself as
                    vice does, it clings to the altars of the Church, which have always been a
                    sanctuary for criminals of every species. It is never possible to lay hold of
                    it, to convince it then and there that its principles logically lead to
                    intolerance, inquisition, and despotism. Kierkegaard, for example, is in
                    religion orthodox, in politics a believer in absolutism, towards the close of
                    his career a fanatic. Yet--and this is a genuinely Romantic trait--he all his
                    life long avoids drawing any practical conclusions from his doctrines; one only
                    catches an occasional glimpse of such a feeling as admiration for the
                    Inquisition, or hatred of natural science.</p>
                <p>Let us take, by way of contrast, another supporter of orthodoxy and absolutism,
                    Joseph de Maistre, as high-minded and sincere a believer as Kierkegaard, and
                    equally philanthropic. De Maistre pursues all his theories to their clear
                    conclusions, shirking nothing which must be regarded as a direct consequence of
                    his beliefs. Like Kierkegaard, he is a man of brilliant parts and solid culture,
                    but whereas Kierkegaard, when it comes to practical applications, is as afraid
                    of "public scandal" as any old maid, De Maistre boldly accepts all necessary
                    consequences. The famous passage in praise of the executioner in the sixth
                    conversation of the _Soirées de Saint-Petersbourg_, leaves nothing to be desired
                    in the matter of plain speaking. The executioner is a "sublime being," "the
                    corner-stone of society;" along with him "all social order disappears."
                    According to De Maistre's theory, two powers are required to quell the
                    rebellious spirits--the spirit of unbelief and the spirit of disobedience--let
                    loose by the French Revolution, and these two are the Pope and the executioner.
                    The Pope and the executioner are the two main props of society; the one crushes
                    the revolutionary thought with his bull, the other cuts off the revolutionary
                    head with his axe. It is a pleasure to read such argument. Here we have vigour
                    and determination, effectual expression of a clear thought, energetic and
                    undisguised reaction. And De Maistre is the same in everything. He is not, like
                    Danish reactionaries who call themselves Liberals, reactionary in social matters
                    and religion, and liberal or half-liberal in politics. He loathes political
                    liberty; he jeers (in his letters) at the emancipation of women; in a special
                    essay he deliberately and warmly defends the Spanish Inquisition; and in all
                    trueheartedness and manly seriousness he desires the reinstitution of the
                    _auto-da-fé_, and is not ashamed to say it, seeing that he thinks it. Look well
                    at such a man as this--gifted and eminent, great as a statesman, great as an
                    author, who sacrifices his whole fortune sooner than make the least concession
                    to the Revolution, which he abhors, or to Napoleon, whom he detests; who frankly
                    adores the executioner as the indispensable upholder of order; who gives the
                    gallows the most important place in his statute-book, and counsels the Church to
                    have recourse to the axe and the faggot--there is a figure worthy of note; a
                    proud, bold countenance, which expresses an unmistakable mental bent, and which
                    one does not forget. This is a type one takes pleasure in, as the naturalist
                    takes pleasure in a fine specimen of a species of which he has hitherto only met
                    with imperfect and unsatisfactory examples. Looking at the matter from a
                    practical point of view, it may be considered fortunate that such personalities
                    are not to be found in Danish literature, but their absence gives a less plastic
                    character to its history.</p>
                <p>It is all very well to say that we Danes only assimilated the good and healthy
                    elements of German Romanticism. When we see how the German Romanticists end, we
                    comprehend that from the very beginning there was concealed in Romanticism a
                    reactionary principle which prescribed the course--the curve--of their
                    careers.</p>
                <p>Friedrich Schlegel, the author of _Lucinde_, the free-thinking admirer of Fichte,
                    who, in his _Versuch über den Begriff des Republikanismus_ (Essay on the Idea of
                    Republicanism), called the democratic republic, with female suffrage, the only
                    reasonable form of government, is converted to Catholicism, becomes a mystic and
                    a faithful servant of the Church, and in his later writings endeavours to
                    promote the cause of reactionary absolutism. Novalis and Schleiermacher, who in
                    their early writings display a mixture of pantheism and pietism, of Spinoza and
                    Zinzendorf, steadily drift away from Spinoza and approach orthodoxy. In his
                    later life Schleiermacher recants those _Letters on Lucinde_ which he had
                    written in a spirit of the purest youthful enthusiasm. Novalis, who in his
                    youthful letters declares himself "prepared for any sort of enlightenment," and
                    hopes that he may live to see "a new massacre of St. Bartholemew, a wholesale
                    destruction of despotisms and prisons," who desires a republic, and who, at the
                    time when Fichte is prosecuted for atheism, remarks, "Brave Fichte is really
                    fighting for us all,"--this same Novalis ends by looking on the king in the
                    light of an earthly Providence, condemning Protestantism as revolutionary,
                    defending the temporal power of the Pope, and extolling the spirit of Jesuitism.
                    Fouqué, the knight without fear and without reproach, becomes in the end a
                    pietist Don Quixote, whose great desire is a return to the conditions of
                    feudalism. Clemens Brentano, in his youth the most mettlesome of poets, who both
                    in life and literature made war upon every species of convention, becomes the
                    credulous secretary of a nun, a hysterical visionary; does nothing for the space
                    of five years but fill volume after volume with the sayings of Anna Katharina
                    Emmerich. Zacharias Werner is a variant of the same Romantic type. He starts in
                    his career as a friend of "enlightenment"; but soon a process of moral
                    dissolution begins; he first extols Luther, then turns Roman Catholic and
                    recants his eulogy; in the end he becomes a priest, and as such displays, both
                    in his life and in his sentimentally gross writings and sermons, a combination
                    of coarse sensuality and priestly unction.</p>
                <p>And Steffens--he who stormed the heaven of German Romanticism, carried the sacred
                    fire to Denmark, and set men's minds in such violent uproar that he was
                    compelled to leave his country--what of him? what was he? An upright, weak
                    character, with a brain charged with confused enthusiasms; all feeling and
                    imitative fancy; no lucidity of thought or pregnant concision of style. It is
                    literally impossible to read the so-called scientific writings of his later
                    period; one runs the risk of being drowned in watery sentimentality or smothered
                    by ennui. "When," says Julian Schmidt, "he expounded the _Naturphilosophie_ in
                    his broken German from the professorial chair, his mathematical calculations
                    came out wrong and his experiments failed, but his audience was carried away by
                    his earnestness, his almost religious solemnity, his naïve, child-like
                    enthusiasm." Naïveté was a quality that the Northerner of those days seldom
                    lacked. In his best days, Steffens, captivated by the theories of the
                    _Naturphilosophie_, took an innocent pleasure in tracing the attributes of the
                    human mind in minerals, in humanising geology and botany. But the Revolution of
                    July turned his head. Inflamed by pietism, that elderly lady who for the last
                    thirteen years had been the object of his affections, and for whose sake he had
                    already more than once entered the lists, he closed his literary career with a
                    series of feeble attacks upon the young writers of post-revolutionary
                    Germany.</p>
                <p>In this he was only following in the footsteps of his master, Schelling.
                    Schelling, who, in marked contrast to Fichte with his clear doctrine of the Ego,
                    dwells upon the mysterious nature of the mind, and bases not only philosophy,
                    but also art and religion, upon the perception of genius, the so-called
                    "intellectual intuition," displays both in his doctrine and in his want of
                    method the arbitrariness, the lawlessness, which is the kernel of Romanticism.
                    As early as 1802, in his _Bruno_, he used the significant expression and future
                    catchword, "Christian philosophy," though he still maintained that, in genuine
                    religious value, the Bible is not to be compared with the sacred books of
                    India--a theory which even Görres champions in the early stage of his literary
                    career. Having, like Novalis, at Tieck's instigation, made a close study of
                    Jakob Böhme and the other mystics, Schelling began to philosophise mystically on
                    the subject of "Nature in God," an expression appropriated by Martensen in his
                    _Spekulative Dogmatik_. But when, shortly afterwards, a patent of nobility was
                    conferred on him (as professor at the University of Munich), and he was made
                    President of the Academy of Science in Catholic and clerical Bavaria, the famous
                    "Philosophy of Revelation" (Offenbarungsphilosophie) commenced to germinate in
                    his mind. Soon the transformation was complete; the fiery enthusiast had become
                    a courtier, the prophet a charlatan. With his mysteries, his announcements of a
                    marvellous science, "which had hitherto been considered impossible," his refusal
                    to print his wisdom, to do anything but communicate it verbally, and even then
                    not in its entirety, he qualified himself for being called, after Hegel's death,
                    to Berlin, to lend a helping hand to State religion in the "Christian-Germanic"
                    police-governed Prussia of the day, and to teach a State philosophy, for which,
                    as he himself said, the only suitable name is Christology. Here it was that the
                    young generation, the Hegelians of the Left, fell upon him and tore his mystic
                    cobweb into a thousand pieces.</p>
                <p>Yet Schelling is the least irrational of the Romantic philosophers. He is
                    vehemently accused of heresy by Franz Baader, the reincarnated Jakob Böhme, the
                    object of Kierkegaard's admiration, who reproaches him with setting the Trinity
                    upon a logical balance-pole, and, still worse, with daring to deny the existence
                    of a personal devil. The utterances of the others are in keeping with this.
                    Schubert writes _The Symbolism of Dreams_--was not the dream the ideal of
                    Romanticism?--occupies himself in all seriousness with interpreting them, happy
                    in his persuasion that clairvoyance and visions are the highest sources of
                    knowledge. The vision-seer of Prevorst, whom Strauss, characteristically enough,
                    begins his public career by exposing, plays an important part in those days.
                    Then there is Görres, who at the time of the great Revolution was "inspired to
                    triumphal song by the fall of Rome and the dissolution of the Holy Roman
                    Empire," and who afterwards took an active and honourable part in rousing German
                    patriotic spirit during the struggle against Napoleon; this same Görres becomes
                    the author of _Christian Mysticism_ (a book which Kierkegaard read with shudders
                    of awe), revels in the blood of martyrs, gloats over the agonies and ecstasies
                    of the saints, enumerates the different aureoles, nail-prints, and wounds in the
                    side by which they are distinguished, and prostrates himself in the dust, he,
                    the old Jacobin, before the one true Catholic Church, chanting the praises of
                    the Holy Alliance. To these add the politicians: Adam Müller, who, as Gotschall
                    has aptly said, pursues in politics the quest of Novalis's "blue flower," who
                    would fain fuse State, Science, Church, and Stage into one marvellous unit;
                    Haller, who concealed his conversion to Catholicism in order to retain his
                    appointments, and who, in his _Restauration der Staatswissenschaften_ (Revival
                    of the Science of Statesmanship), bases this science upon theocracy; Leo
                    (scathingly criticised by Ruge), who, in the same spirit, inveighs against the
                    humanity of the age and its reluctance to shed the blood of Radicals; and Stahl,
                    who, in his _Philosophy of Law_, compares marriage to the relation between
                    Christ and the Church, the family to the Trinity, and the earthly right of
                    succession to man's right to the heavenly inheritance. Taking all this together,
                    one feels as if Romanticism ended in a sort of witches' Sabbath, in which the
                    philosophers play the part of the old crones, amidst the thunders of the
                    obscurantists, the insane yells of the mystics, and the shouts of the
                    politicians for temporal and ecclesiastical despotism, while theology and
                    theosophy fall upon the sciences and suffocate them with their caresses.</p>

                <p>THE PIONEERS OF ROMANTICISM</p>
                <p>Any one who makes acquaintance with the Germany of to-day, either by travelling
                    in the country or by reading about it, and then compares it with the Germany of
                    the beginning of the century, is astounded by the contrast. What a distance
                    between then and now! Who would believe that this Realistic Germany had ever
                    been a Romantic Germany!</p>
                <p>Public utterances, private conversation, the very physiognomy of the towns, bear
                    in our days a distinct stamp of realism. Walk along any street in Berlin, and
                    you meet men in uniform, officers and privates, erect, decorated. The literature
                    in the windows of the bookshops has for the most part a practical tendency. Even
                    the furniture and ornaments are influenced by the new spirit. One cannot imagine
                    anything more prosaic and warlike than the shop of a Berlin dealer in fancy
                    articles. On the clocks, where of old a knight in armour knelt and kissed his
                    lady's finger-tips, Uhlans and Cuirassiers now stand in full uniform. Conical
                    bullets hang as trinkets from watch-chains, and piled muskets form candelabra.
                    The metal in fashion is iron. The word in fashion is also iron. The present
                    occupation of this nation of philosophers and poets is assuredly not
                    poetry-writing and philosophising. Even highly cultured Germans know little
                    about philosophy now-a-days--not one German student in twenty has read a word of
                    Hegel; interest in poetry, as such, is practically dead; political and social
                    questions rouse a hundred times more attention than problems of culture or
                    psychical conundrums.</p>
                <p>And this is the people which once was lost in Romantic reveries and speculations,
                    and saw its prototype in Hamlet! Hamlet and Bismarck! Bismarck and Romanticism!
                    Unquestionably the great German statesman succeeded in carrying all Germany with
                    him chiefly because he offered to his country in his own person the very
                    qualities of which it had so long felt the want. Through him politics have been
                    substituted for æsthetics. Germany has been united; the military monarchy has
                    swallowed up the small States, and with them all their feudal idylls; Prussia
                    has become the Piedmont of Germany, and has impressed its orderly and practical
                    spirit upon the new empire; and simultaneously with this, natural science has
                    supplanted or metamorphosed philosophy, and the idea of nationality has
                    superseded or modified the "humanity" ideal. The War of Liberation of 1813 was
                    pre-eminently a result of enthusiasm; the victories of 1870 were pre-eminently a
                    result of the most careful calculation.</p>
                <p>The idea which is the guiding star of the new Germany is the idea of organising
                    itself as a whole. It pervades both life and literature. The expression "In
                    Reih' und Glied"--In Ordered Ranks--(the title of a novel by Spielhagen) might
                    be the universal watchword. The national aim is to gather together that which
                    has been scattered, to diffuse the culture which has been the possession of too
                    few, to found a great state, a great society; and it is required of the
                    individual that he shall sacrifice his individuality for the sake of adding to
                    the power of the whole, of the mass. The power of the mass! This idea may be
                    traced in all the most remarkable phenomena of the age. Belief in it underlies
                    the calculations of Bismarck, the agitation of Lassalle, the tactics of Moltke,
                    and the music of Wagner. A desire to educate the people and unite them in a
                    common aim is the mainspring of the literary activity of the prose authors of
                    the period. A common feature of all the works which most clearly reflect the
                    times is that they keep to the subject, to the matter in hand. The influence of
                    the great idea, "the power of the mass," makes itself felt here too. In the new
                    literature the relation of the individual to the State, the sacrifice of
                    personal volition and originality entailed by the yoking of the Ego to the State
                    chariot, presents itself in marked contrast to the Romanticist worship of the
                    talented individual with all his peculiarities, and the Romanticist indifference
                    to everything historical and political. Romantic literature was always
                    pre-eminently drawing-room literature, the ideal of Romanticism being
                    intellectual society and æsthetic tea-parties (_vide_ the conversations in
                    Tieck's _Fantasus_).</p>
                <p>How different everything was in those old days! In both life and literature the
                    detached Ego, in its homeless independence, is omnipresent. The guiding star
                    here is, indeed, nought else but the free, unhistorical Ego. The country is
                    divided into a multitude of small States, ruled by three hundred sovereigns and
                    fifteen hundred semi-sovereigns. In these States the so-called "enlightened"
                    despotism of the eighteenth century prevails, with its narrow, petrified social
                    conditions and relations. The nobleman is lord and master of his serfs, the
                    father, lord and master of his family--everywhere stern justice, but no equity.
                    There are in reality no great tasks for the individual, hence there is no room
                    for genius. The theatre is the only place where those who are not of princely
                    birth can gain any experience of all the manifold phases of human life, hence
                    the stage mania of literature. Lacking any social field in which to work, all
                    activity necessarily takes the form either of war with reality or flight from
                    it. Flight is prepared for by the influence of the rediscovered antique and of
                    Winckelmann's writings; war, by the influence of the sentimentally melancholy
                    English writers (Young, Sterne) and of Rousseau, reverenced as the apostle of
                    nature, who, as Schiller expressed it, "would fain out of Christians make
                    men."</p>
                <p>Our first proceeding must be to trace the rising of this star, the genesis of
                    this free, Romantic Ego, to whom, be it remembered, all the greatest intellects
                    of Germany stood sponsor.</p>
                <p>It was Lessing who laid the foundations of the intellectual life of modern
                    Germany. Clear of thought, strong of will, indefatigably active, he was a
                    reformer in every matter in which he interested himself. With perfect
                    consciousness of what he was doing, he enlightened and educated the German mind.
                    He was the embodiment of manly independence and vigorous, tireless militancy.
                    His personal ideal, as it is revealed in his life and writings, was proud
                    independence in combination with a wise love of his fellow-men, which overcame
                    all differences of creed. Hence, solitary as he stood in his own day, his Ego
                    became a source of light. He was the "Prometheus of German prose." His great
                    achievement was that of freeing German culture for all time from the swaddling
                    bands of theology, as Luther had freed it from those of Catholicism. His life
                    and his criticism were action, and to him the essence of poetry too was action.
                    All his characters are instinct with dramatic passion. In opposition to the
                    theological doctrine of punishment and reward, he maintained that to do right
                    for the sake of doing right is the highest morality. And for him the history of
                    the world became the history of the education of the human race. To a certain
                    extent the word "education" is employed by him merely as a concession to his
                    readers, who, he knew, could not conceive of any development without a divine
                    educator; but, all the same, the idea of natural development is not an idea with
                    which he was familiar. To him, history is the record of "enlightenment." The Ego
                    to him is not nature, but pure mind.</p>
                <p>In reality, all that was best in Lessing was entirely unsympathetic to the new
                    group of Romanticists; they had less in common with him than with any other of
                    the great German authors, Schiller not excepted. Nevertheless, it was natural
                    enough that they should refuse to acknowledge any connection between Lessing and
                    those of his disciples (men such as Nicolai, Engel, Garve, and Schütz), who
                    were, from the "enlightenment" standpoint, their bitter enemies and ruthless
                    persecutors. This was done by Friedrich Schlegel in an essay in which, while
                    praising the power and the width of Lessing's grasp, he lays chief stress upon
                    everything in him that is irregular, boldly revolutionary, unsystematic, and
                    paradoxical, dwells on his bellicose wit, and draws attention to everything that
                    can be construed into cynicism. The Romanticists could not possibly claim a
                    champion of reason, pure and simple, as their forerunner, hence they attempted
                    to characterise the nutritive element in Lessing's works as mere seasoning, as
                    the salt which preserves from corruption.</p>
                <p>They owed far more to Herder. They evidence their descent from him both by their
                    continuation of the _Sturm und Drang_ period and by their capacity of
                    understanding and reproducing the poetry of all countries. In Herder the new
                    century germinated, as in Lessing the old had come to its close. Herder sets
                    genesis and growth above thought and action. To him the true man is not only a
                    thinking and moral being, but a portion of nature. He loves and sets most store
                    by the original; he prefers intuition to reason, and would overcome
                    narrow-mindedness, not by reason, but by originality. The man of intuitions is
                    to him the most human. His own genius was the genius of receptivity. He expanded
                    his Ego until it comprehended every kind of originality, but it was by virtue of
                    feeling that he comprehended, that he absorbed into his soul a wealth of life,
                    human and national.</p>
                <p>From Herder the Romanticists derive that which is most valuable in their literary
                    criticism--the universal receptivity which finds expression in the impulse to
                    translate and explain; from him they derive the first stimulus to a scientific
                    study of both European and Asiatic languages; from him comes their love for what
                    is national in both their own and foreign literature, their love of Spanish
                    romance and of Shakespeare's plays. Herder grasped things in their entirety as
                    did Goethe after him. His profound comprehension of national peculiarities
                    becomes in Goethe the genius's intuition of the typical in nature, and is
                    exalted by Schelling under the name of "intellectual intuition." The objection
                    of the Romanticists to the idea of aim or purpose may be traced back to Herder.
                    His theory of history excluded the idea of purpose: what happens has a cause and
                    is subject to laws, but cannot be explained by anything which has not yet
                    happened, i.e. by a purpose. The Romanticists transferred this theory into the
                    personal, the psychical domain. To them purposelessness is another name for
                    Romantic genius; the man of genius lives without a definite purpose;
                    purposelessness is idleness, and idleness is the mark and privilege of the
                    elect. In this caricature of a philosophy there is not much resemblance to
                    Herder's. But he is the originator of a new conception of genius, of the belief,
                    namely, that genius is intuitive, that it consists in a certain power of
                    perceiving and apprehending without any resort to abstract ideas. It is this
                    conception which, with the Romanticists, becomes scorn of experimental methods
                    in science, and approbation of extraordinary vagaries in art.</p>
                <p>Goethe was the fulfilment of all that Herder had promised. To him man was not
                    merely theoretically the last link in nature's chain; the men in his works were
                    themselves natures; and in his scientific research he discerned with the eye of
                    genius the universal laws of evolution. His own Ego was a microcosm, and
                    produced the effect of such on the most discerning of his younger
                    contemporaries. "Goethe and life are one," says Rahel. So profound was his
                    insight into nature, so entirely was he a living protest against every
                    supernatural belief, that he did what in him lay to deprive genius of its
                    character of apparent incomprehensibility and contrariety to reason, by
                    explaining (in his autobiography, _Wahrheit und Dichtung_) his own genius, the
                    most profound and universal of the age, as a natural product developed by
                    circumstances--thereby creating the type of literary criticism to which the
                    Romanticists were strongly opposed.</p>
                <p>From Goethe the young generation derived their theory of the rights and the
                    importance of the great, free personality. He had always lived his own life, and
                    had always lived it fully and freely. Without making any attack whatever on the
                    existing conditions of society, he had remoulded, according to his own
                    requirements, the social relations in which he found himself placed. He becomes
                    the soul of the youthful and joyous court of Weimar, with the audacity of youth
                    and genius drawing every one with him into a whirl of gaiety--fêtes, picnics,
                    skating expeditions, masquerades--animated by a wild joy in nature, which is now
                    "lightened," now "darkened" by love affairs of a more or less dubious character.
                    Jean Paul writes to a friend that he can only describe the morals of Weimar to
                    him by word of mouth. When we hear that even skating was a scandal to the worthy
                    Philistines of that town, we are not surprised by old Wieland's ill-natured
                    remark, that the circle in question appeared to him to be aiming at "brutalising
                    animal nature." Thus it was that the sweet, refined coquette, Frau von Stein,
                    became Goethe's muse for ten whole years, the original of Leonore and Iphigenia;
                    and later he created a still greater scandal by taking into his house Christiane
                    Vulpius (the young girl whose presence had become a necessity to him, and who,
                    in spite of her faults, never embittered his life by making any demands upon
                    him), and living with her for eighteen years before obtaining the sanction of
                    the Church to their union.</p>
                <p>Goethe's as well as Schiller's youthful works had been inspired by what the
                    Germans call the "Freigeisterei" of passion, its demand for freedom, its
                    instinct of revolt. Both breathe one and the same spirit, the spirit of
                    defiance. Goethe's _Die Geschwister_ treats of the passion of brother for
                    sister. The conclusion of _Stella_, in its original form, is a justification of
                    bigamy; and Jean Paul, too, in his _Siebenkäs_, treats of bigamy as a thing
                    perfectly permissible in the case of a genius to whom the first tie has become
                    burdensome. _Götz_ represents the tragic fate of the man of genius who rises in
                    revolt against a lukewarm and corrupt age. Schiller's _Die Räuber_, with its
                    device _In Tyrannos_, and its motto from Hippocrates, "That which medicine
                    cannot cure iron cures, and that which iron cannot cure fire cures," is a
                    declaration of war against society. Karl Moor is the noble-hearted idealist, who
                    in "the castrated century" is inevitably doomed to perish as a criminal.
                    Schiller's robbers are not highwaymen, but revolutionaries. They do not plunder,
                    but punish. They have separated themselves from society to revenge themselves
                    upon it for the wrongs it has done them. Schiller's defiance is still more
                    personally expressed in those poems of his first period which were written under
                    the influence of his relations with Frau von Kalb, poems re-written and entirely
                    altered in the later editions. In the one which ultimately received the title
                    _Der Kampf_, but which was originally called _Freigeisterei der Leidenschaft_,
                    he writes:--</p>
                <p> "Woher dies Zittern, dies unnennbare Entsetzen, Wenn mich dein liebevoller Arm
                    umschlang? Weil Dich ein Eid, den auch nur Wallungen verletzen, In fremde
                    Fesseln zwang?</p>
                <p> "Weil ein Gebrauch, den die Gesetze heilig prägen, Des Zufalls schwere Missethat
                    geweiht? Nein--unerschrocken trotz ich einem Bund entgegen, Den die erröthende
                    Natur bereut.</p>
                <p> "O zittre nicht--Du hast als Sünderin geschworen, Ein Meineid ist der Reue
                    fromme Pflicht, Das Herz war mein, das Du vor dem Altar verloren, Mit
                    Menschenfreuden spielt der Himmel nicht."[1]</p>
                <p>Comical as this naïve sophistry sounds, and unreliable as is the assurance that
                    Heaven will not permit itself now and again to play with human happiness, the
                    spirit of the verses is unmistakable; and, as Hettner aptly observes, Don Carlos
                    uses almost the same words: "The rights of my love are older than the ceremonies
                    at the altar."</p>
                <p>The model for Schiller's young Queen Elizabeth was Charlotte von Kalb. This lady,
                    the passion of the poet's youth, had been unwillingly forced into matrimony by
                    her parents. She and Schiller met in 1784, and in 1788 they were still
                    meditating a permanent union of their destinies. Soon after Schiller left her,
                    she became Jean Paul's mistress. (Caroline Schlegel jestingly calls her
                    Jeannette Pauline.) Jean Paul characterises her thus: "She has two great
                    possessions: great eyes (I never saw their like) and a great soul." He himself
                    confesses that it is she whom he has described in one of his principal works as
                    the Titaness, Linda. In _Titan_ (118 Zykel) we are told of Linda that she must
                    be tenderly treated, not only on account of her delicacy, but also in the matter
                    of her aversion to matrimony, which is extreme. She cannot even accompany a
                    friend to the altar, which she calls the scaffold of woman's liberty, the
                    funeral pyre of the noblest, freest love. To take, she says, the best possible
                    view of it, the heroic epic of love is there transformed into the pastoral of
                    marriage. Her sensible friend vainly insists that her aversion to marriage can
                    have no other ground than her hatred of priests; that wedlock only signifies
                    everlasting love, and all true love regards itself as everlasting; that there
                    are as many unhappy free-love connections as marriages, if not more, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Frau von Kalb herself writes to Jean Paul: "Why all this talk about seduction?
                    Spare the poor creatures, I beg of you, and alarm their hearts and consciences
                    no more. Nature is petrified enough already. I shall never change my opinion on
                    this subject; I do not understand this virtue, and cannot call any one blessed
                    for its sake. Religion here upon earth is nothing else than the development and
                    maintenance of the powers and capacities with which our natures have been
                    endowed. Man should not submit to compulsion, but neither should he acquiesce in
                    wrongful renunciation. Let the bold, powerful, mature human nature, which knows
                    and uses its strength, have its way. But in our generation human nature is weak
                    and contemptible. Our laws are the outcome of wretchedness and dire necessity,
                    seldom of wisdom. Love needs no laws."</p>
                <p>A vigorous mind speaks to us in this letter. The leap from this to the idea of
                    _Lucinde_ is not a long one, but the fall to the very vulgar elaboration of
                    _Lucinde_ is great. We do not, however, rightly understand these outbursts until
                    we understand the social conditions which produced them, and realise that they
                    are not isolated and accidental tirades, but are conditioned by the position in
                    which the majority of poetic natures stood to society at that time.</p>
                <p>Weimar was then the headquarters and gathering-place of Germany's classical
                    authors. It is not difficult to understand how they came to gather in this
                    little capital of a little dukedom. Of Germany's two great monarchs, Joseph the
                    Second was too much occupied with his efforts at reform, too eager for the
                    spread of "enlightenment," to have any attention to spare for German poetry; and
                    the Voltairean Frederick of Prussia was too French in his tastes and
                    intellectual tendencies to take any interest in German poets. It was at the
                    small courts that they were welcomed. Schiller lived at Mannheim, Jean Paul at
                    Gotha, Goethe at Weimar. Poetry had had no stronghold in Germany for many a long
                    year, but now Weimar became one. Thither Goethe summoned Herder; Wieland had
                    been there since 1772. Schiller received an appointment in the adjacent Jena.
                    Weimar was, then, the place where passion, as poetical, compared with the
                    prosaic conventions of society, was worshipped most recklessly and with least
                    prejudice, in practice as well as theory. "Ah! here we have women!" cries Jean
                    Paul when he comes to Weimar. "Everything is revolutionarily daring here; that a
                    woman is married signifies nothing." Wieland "revives himself" by taking his
                    former mistress, Sophie von la Roche, into his house, and Schiller invites Frau
                    von Kalb to accompany him to Paris.</p>
                <p>We thus understand how it was that Jean Paul, when in Weimar, and under the
                    influence of Frau von Kalb's personality, exclaimed: "This much is certain; the
                    heart of the world is beating with a more spiritual and greater revolution than
                    the political, and one quite as destructive."</p>
                <p>What revolution? The emancipation of feeling from the conventions of society; the
                    heart's audacious assumption of its right to regard its own code of laws as the
                    new moral code, to re-cast morals in the interests of morality, and occasionally
                    in the interests of inclination. The Weimar circle had no desire, no thought for
                    anything beyond this, had neither practical nor social reforms in view. It is a
                    genuinely German trait that outwardly they made deep obeisance to the laws which
                    they privately evaded. In conversation, Goethe, in his riper years, invariably
                    maintained that the existing conventions regulating the relations of the sexes
                    were absolutely necessary in the interests of civilisation; and in their books
                    authors gave expression to revolutionary sentiments which were more or less
                    their own, only to recant at the end of the book. The hero either confesses his
                    error, or commits suicide, or is punished for his defiance of society, or
                    renounces society altogether (Karl Moor, Werther, Tasso, Linda). It is exactly
                    the proceeding of the heretical authors of the Middle Ages, who concluded their
                    books with a notice that everything in them must of course be interpreted in
                    harmony with the doctrines and decrees of Holy Mother Church.</p>
                <p>Into this Weimar circle of gifted women Madame de Staël, "the whirlwind in
                    petticoats," as she has been called, is introduced when she comes to Germany. In
                    the midst of them she produces the effect of some strange wild bird. What a
                    contrast between her aims and their predilections I With them everything is
                    personal, with her by this time everything is social. She has appeared before
                    the public; she is striking doughty blows in the cause of social reform. For
                    such deeds even the most advanced of these German women of the "enlightenment"
                    period are of much too mild a strain. Her aim is to revolutionise life
                    politically, theirs to make it poetical. The idea of flinging the gauntlet to a
                    Napoleon would never have entered the mind of any one of them. What a use to
                    make of a lady's glove, a pledge of love! It is not the rights of humanity, but
                    the rights of the heart which they understand; their strife is not against the
                    wrongs of life but against its prose. The relation of the gifted individual to
                    society does not here, as in France, take the form of a conflict between the
                    said individual's rebellious assertion of his liberty and the traditional
                    compulsion of society, but of a conflict between the poetry of the desires of
                    the individual and the prose of political and social conventions. Hence the
                    perpetual glorification in Romantic literature of capacity and strength of
                    desire, of wish; a subject to which Friedrich Schlegel in particular perpetually
                    recurs. It is in reality the one outwardly directed power that men
                    possess--impotence itself conceived as a power.</p>
                <p>We find the same admiration of wish in Kierkegaard's _Enten-Eller_ (Either-Or).
                    "The reason why Aladdin is so refreshing is that we feel the childlike audacity
                    of genius in its wildly fantastic wishes. How many are there in our day who dare
                    really wish?" &amp;c. The childlike, for ever the childlike! But who can wonder
                    that _wish_, the mother of religions, the outward expression of inaction, became
                    the catchword of the Romanticists? _Wish_ is poetry; society as it exists,
                    prose. It is only when we judge them from this standpoint that we rightly
                    understand even the most serene, most chastened works of Germany's greatest
                    poets. Goethe's _Tasso_, with its conflict between the statesman and the poet
                    (i.e. between reality and poetry), its delineation of the contrast between these
                    two who complete each other, and are only unlike "because nature did not make
                    one man of them," is, in spite of its crystalline limpidity of style and its
                    keynote of resignation, a product of the self-same long fermentation which
                    provides the Romantic School with all its fermentative matter. The theme of
                    _Wilhelm Meister_ is in reality the same. It, too, represents the gradual, slow
                    reconciliation and fusion of the dreamed of ideal and the earthly reality. But
                    only the greatest minds rose to this height; the main body of writers of
                    considerable, but less lucid intellect never got beyond the inward discord. The
                    more poetry became conscious of itself as a power, the more the poet realised
                    his dignity, and literature became a little world in itself with its own special
                    technical interests, the more distinctly did the conflict with reality assume
                    the subordinate form of a conflict with philistinism (see, for instance,
                    Eichendorff's _Krieg den Philistern_). Poetry no longer champions the eternal
                    rights of liberty against the tyranny of outward circumstances; it champions
                    itself as poetry against the prose of life. This is the Teutonic, the
                    German-Scandinavian, that is to say, the narrow literary conception of the
                    service that poetry is capable of rendering to the cause of liberty.</p>
                <p>"We must remember," says Kierkegaard (_Begrebet Ironi_, p. 322), "that Tieck and
                    the entire Romantic School entered, or believed they entered, into relations
                    with a period in which men were, so to speak, petrified, in final, unalterable
                    social conditions. Everything was perfected and completed, in a sort of divine
                    Chinese perfection, which left no reasonable longing unsatisfied, no reasonable
                    wish unfulfilled. The glorious principles and maxims of 'use and wont' were the
                    objects of a pious worship; everything, including the absolute itself, was
                    absolute; men refrained from polygamy; they wore peaked hats; nothing was
                    without its significance. Each man felt, with the precise degree of dignity that
                    corresponded to his position, what he effected, the exact importance to himself
                    and to the whole, of his unwearied endeavour. There was no frivolous
                    indifference to punctuality in those days; all ungodliness of that kind tried to
                    insinuate itself in vain. Everything pursued its tranquil, ordered course; even
                    the suitor went soberly about his business; he knew that he was going on a
                    lawful errand, was taking a most serious step. Everything went by clockwork. Men
                    waxed enthusiastic over the beauties of nature on Midsummer Day; were
                    overwhelmed by the thought of their sins on the great fast-days; fell in love
                    when they were twenty, went to bed at ten o'clock. They married and devoted
                    themselves to domestic and civic duties; they brought up families; in the prime
                    of their manhood notice was taken in high places of their honourable and
                    successful efforts; they lived on terms of intimacy with the pastor, under whose
                    eye they did the many generous deeds which they knew he would recount in a voice
                    trembling with emotion when the day came for him to preach their funeral sermon.
                    They were friends in the genuine sense of the word, _ein wirklicher Freund, wie
                    man wirklicher Kanzleirat war_."</p>
                <p>I fail to see anything typical in this description. Except that we wear round
                    hats instead of peaked ones, every word of it might apply to the present day;
                    there is nothing especially indicative of one period more than another. No; the
                    distinctive feature of the period in question is the gifted writer's, the
                    Romanticist's, conception of philistinism. In my criticism of Johan Ludvig
                    Heiberg's first Romantic attempts, I wrote: "They (the Romanticists) looked upon
                    it from the philosophical point of view as finality, from the intellectual, as
                    narrow-mindedness; not, like us, from the moral point of view, as
                    contemptibility. With it they contrasted their own infinite longing.... They
                    confronted its prose with their own youthful poetry; we confront its
                    contemptibility with our virile will" (_Samlede Skrifter_, i. p. 467). As a
                    general rule, then, they, with their thoughts and longings, fled society and
                    reality, though now and again, as already indicated, they attempted, if not
                    precisely to realise their ideas in life, at least to sketch a possible solution
                    of the problem how to transform reality in its entirety into poetry.</p>
                <p>Not that they show a spark of the indignation or the initiative which we find in
                    the French Romantic author (George Sand, for instance); they merely amuse
                    themselves with elaborating revolutionary, or at least startling fancies.</p>
                <p>That which Goethe had attained to, namely, the power of moulding his surroundings
                    to suit his own personal requirements, was to the young generation the point of
                    departure. In this particular they from their youth saw the world from Goethe's
                    point of view; they made the measure of freedom which he had won for himself and
                    the conditions which had been necessary for the full development of his gifts
                    and powers, the average, or more correctly the minimum, requirement of every man
                    with talent, no matter how little. They transformed the requirements of his
                    nature into a universal rule, ignored the self-denial he had laboriously
                    practised and the sacrifices he had made, and not only proclaimed the
                    unconditional rights of passion, but, with tiresome levity and pedantic
                    lewdness, preached the emancipation of the senses. And another influence, very
                    different from that of Goethe's powerful self-assertion, also made itself felt,
                    namely, the influence of Berlin. To Goethe's free, unrestrained humanity there
                    was added in Berlin an ample alloy of the scoffing, anti-Christian spirit which
                    had emanated from the court of Frederick the Great, and the licence which had
                    prevailed at that of his successor.</p>
                <p>But both Goethe and Schiller paved the way for Romanticism not only positively,
                    by their proclamation of the rights of passion, but also negatively, by the
                    conscious attitude of opposition to their own age which they assumed in their
                    later years. In another form, the Romanticist's aversion to reality is already
                    to be found in them. I adduce two famous instances of the astonishing lack of
                    interest shown by Goethe, the greatest creative mind of the day, in political
                    realities; they prove at the same time how keen was his interest in science.
                    Writing of the campaign against France during the French Revolution, a campaign
                    in which he took part, he mentions that he spent most of his time in observing
                    "various phenomena of colour and of personal courage." And after the battle of
                    Jena Knebel writes: "Goethe has been busy with optics the whole time. We study
                    osteology under his guidance, the times being well adapted to such study, as all
                    the fields are covered with preparations." The bodies of his fallen countrymen
                    did not inspire the poet with odes; he dissected them and studied their
                    bones.</p>
                <p>Such instances as these give us some impression of the attitude of aloofness
                    which Goethe as a poet maintained towards the events of his day. But we must not
                    overlook the fine side of his refusal to write patriotic war-songs during the
                    struggle with Napoleon. "Would it be like me to sit in my room and write
                    war-songs? In the night bivouacs, when we could hear the horses of the enemy's
                    outposts neighing, then I might possibly have done it. But it was not my life,
                    that, and not my affair; it was Theodor Körner's. Therefore his war-songs become
                    him well. I have not a warlike nature nor warlike tastes, and war-songs would
                    have been a mask very unbecoming to me. I have never been artificial in my
                    poetry." Goethe, like his disciple Heiberg, was in this case led to refrain by
                    the strong feeling that he only cared to write of what he had himself
                    experienced; but he also tells us that he regarded themes of a historical nature
                    as "the most dangerous and most thankless."</p>
                <p>His ideal, and that of the whole period, is humanity pure and simple--a man's
                    private life is everything. The tremendous conflicts of the eighteenth century
                    and the "enlightenment" period are all, in consonance with the human idealism of
                    the day, contained in the life story, the development story, of the individual.
                    But the cult of humanity does not only imply lack of interest in history, but
                    also a general lack of interest in the subject for its own sake. In one of his
                    letters to Goethe, Schiller writes that two things are to be demanded of the
                    poet and of the artist--in the first place, that he shall rise above reality,
                    and in the second, that he shall keep within the bounds of the material, the
                    natural. He explains his meaning thus: The artist who lives amidst unpropitious,
                    formless surroundings, and consequently ignores these surroundings in his art,
                    runs the risk of altogether losing touch with the tangible, of becoming
                    abstract, or, if his mind is not of a robust type, fantastic; if, on the other
                    hand, he keeps to the world of reality, he is apt to be too real, and, if he has
                    little imagination, to copy slavishly and vulgarly. These words indicate, as it
                    were, the watershed which divides the German literature of this period. On the
                    one side we have the unnational art-poetry of Goethe and Schiller, with its
                    continuation in the fantasies of the Romanticists, and on the other side the
                    merely sensational or entertaining literature of the hour
                    (Unterhaltungslitteratur), which is based on reality, but a philistine reality,
                    the literature of which Lafontaine's sentimental bourgeois romances, and the
                    popular, prosaic family dramas of Schröder, Iffland, and Kotzebue, are the best
                    known examples. It was a misfortune for German literature that such a division
                    came about. But, although the rupture of the better literature with reality
                    first showed itself in a startling form in the writings of the Romanticists, we
                    must not forget that the process had begun long before. Kotzebue had been the
                    antipodes of Schiller and Goethe before he stood in that position to the
                    Romanticists. Of this we get a vivid impression from the following
                    anecdote.[2]</p>
                <p>One day in the early spring of 1802, the little town of Weimar was in the
                    greatest excitement over an event which was the talk of high and low. It had
                    long been apparent that some special festivity was in preparation. It was known
                    that a very famous and highly respected man, President von Kotzebue, had applied
                    privately to the Burgomaster for the use of the newly decorated Town Hall. The
                    most distinguished ladies of the town had for a month past done nothing but
                    order and try on fancy dresses. Fräulein von Imhof had given fifty gold guldens
                    for hers. Astonished eyes had beheld a carver and gilder carrying a wonderful
                    helmet and banner across the street in broad daylight. What could such things be
                    required for? Were there to be theatricals at the Town Hall? It was known that
                    an enormous bell mould made of pasteboard had been ordered. For what was it to
                    be used? The secret soon came out. Some time before this, Kotzebue, famous
                    throughout Europe as the author of _Menschenhass und Reue_, had returned, laden
                    with Russian roubles and provided with a patent of nobility, to his native town,
                    to make a third in the Goethe and Schiller alliance. He had succeeded in gaining
                    admission to the court, and the next thing was to obtain admission to Goethe's
                    circle, which was also a court, and a very exclusive one. The private society of
                    intimates for whom Goethe wrote his immortal convivial songs
                    (Gesellschaftslieder) met once a week at his house. Kotzebue had himself
                    proposed for election by some of the lady members, but Goethe added an amendment
                    to the rules of the society which excluded the would-be intruder, and prevented
                    his even appearing occasionally as a guest. Kotzebue determined to revenge
                    himself by paying homage to Schiller in a manner which he hoped would thoroughly
                    annoy Goethe. The latter had just suppressed some thrusts at the brothers
                    Schlegel in Kotzebue's play, _Die Kleinstädter_, which was one of the pieces in
                    the repertory of the Weimar theatre; so, to damage the theatre, Kotzebue
                    determined to give a grand performance in honour of Schiller at the Town Hall.
                    Scenes from all his plays were to be acted, and finally _The Bell_ was to be
                    recited to an accompaniment of tableaux vivants. At the close of the poem,
                    Kotzebue, dressed as the master-bellfounder, was to shatter the pasteboard mould
                    with a blow of his hammer, and there was to be disclosed, not a bell, but a bust
                    of Schiller. The Kotzebue party, however, had reckoned without their host, that
                    is to say, without Goethe. In all Weimar there was only one bust of Schiller,
                    that which stood in the library. When, on the last day, a messenger was sent to
                    borrow it, the unexpected answer was given, that never in the memory of man had
                    a plaster cast lent for a fête been returned in the condition in which it had
                    been sent, and that the loan must therefore be unwillingly refused. And one can
                    imagine the astonishment and rage of the allies when they heard that the
                    carpenters, arriving at the Town Hall with their boards, laths, and poles, had
                    found the doors locked and had received an intimation from the Burgomaster and
                    Council that, as the hall had been newly painted and decorated, they could not
                    permit it to be used for such a "riotous" entertainment.</p>
                <p>This is only a small piece of provincial town scandal. But what is really
                    remarkable, what constitutes the kernel of the story, is the fact that the whole
                    company of distinguished ladies who had hitherto upheld the fame of Goethe
                    (Countess Henriette von Egloffstein; the beautiful lady of honour and poetess
                    Amalie von Imhof, at a later period the object of Gentz's adoration, whose fifty
                    gold guldens had been wasted, &amp;c., &amp;c.) took offence, and deserted his
                    camp for that of Kotzebue. Even the Countess Einsiedel, whom Goethe had always
                    specially distinguished, went over to the enemy. This shows how little real hold
                    the higher culture had as yet taken even on the highest intellectual and social
                    circles, and how powerful the man of letters still was who concerned himself
                    with real life and sought his subjects in his surroundings.</p>
                <p>There had, most undoubtedly, been a time when Goethe and Schiller themselves were
                    realists. To both, in their first stage of restless ferment, reality had been a
                    necessity. Both had given free play to nature and feeling in their early
                    productions, Goethe in _Götz_ and _Werther_, Schiller in _Die Räuber_. But after
                    _Götz_ had set the fashion of romances of chivalry and highway robbery,
                    _Werther_ of suicide, both in real life and in fiction, and _Die Räuber_ of such
                    productions as _Abällino, der grosse Bandit_, the great writers, finding the
                    reading world unable to discriminate between originals and imitations, withdrew
                    from the arena. Their interest in the subject was lost in their interest in the
                    form. The study of the antique led them to lay ever-increasing weight upon
                    artistic perfection. It was not their lot to find a public which understood
                    them, much less a people that could present them with subjects, make demands of
                    them--give them orders, so to speak. The German people were still too
                    undeveloped. When Goethe, at Weimar, was doing what he could to help Schiller,
                    he found that the latter, on account of his wild life at Mannheim, his notoriety
                    as a political refugee, and especially his pennilessness, was regarded as a
                    writer of most unfortunate antecedents. During the epigram war (Xenienkampf) of
                    1797, both Goethe and Schiller were uniformly treated as poets of doubtful
                    talent. One of the pamphlets against them is dedicated to "die zwei Sudelköche
                    in Weimar und Jena" (the bunglers of Weimar and Jena). It was Napoleon's
                    recognition of Goethe, his wish to see and converse with him, his exclamation:
                    "Voilà un homme!" which greatly helped to establish Goethe's reputation in
                    Germany. A Prussian staff-officer, who was quartered about this time in the
                    poet's house, had never heard his name. His publisher complained bitterly of the
                    small demand for the collected edition of his works; there was a much better
                    sale for those of his brother-in-law, Vulpius (author of _Rinaldo Rinaldini_).
                    _Tasso_ and _Iphigenia_ could not compete with works of such European fame as
                    Kotzebue's _Menschenhass und Reue_; Goethe himself tells us that they were only
                    performed in Weimar once every three or four years. Clearly enough it was the
                    stupidity of the public which turned the great poets from the popular path to
                    glory; but it is equally clear that the new classicism, which they so greatly
                    favoured, was an ever-increasing cause of their unpopularity. Only two of
                    Goethe's works were distinct successes, _Werther_ and _Hermann und
                    Dorothea_.</p>
                <p>What were the proceedings of the two great poets after they turned their backs
                    upon their surroundings? Goethe made the story of his own strenuous intellectual
                    development the subject of plastic poetic treatment. But finding it impossible,
                    so long as he absorbed himself in modern humanity, to attain to the beautiful
                    simplicity of the old Greeks, he began to purge his works of the personal; he
                    composed symbolical poems and allegories, wrote _Die Natürliche Tochter_, in
                    which the characters simply bear the names of their callings, King,
                    Ecclesiastic, &amp;c.; and the neo-classic studies, _Achilleis, Pandora,
                    Palæophron und Neoterpe, Epimenides_, and the _Second Part of Faust_. He began
                    to employ Greek mythology much as it had been employed in French classical
                    literature, namely, as a universally understood metaphorical language. He no
                    longer, as in the _First Part of Faust_, treated the individual as a type, but
                    produced types which were supposed to be individuals. His own _Iphigenia_ was
                    now too modern for him. Ever more marked became that addiction to allegory which
                    led Thorvaldsen too away from life in his art. In his art criticism Goethe
                    persistently maintained that it is not truth to nature, but truth to art which
                    is all-important; he preferred ideal mannerism (such as is to be found in his
                    own drawings preserved in his house in Frankfort) to ungainly but vigorous
                    naturalism. As theatrical director he acted on these same principles; grandeur
                    and dignity were everything to him. He upheld the conventional tragic style of
                    Calderon and Alfieri, Racine and Voltaire. His actors were trained, in the
                    manner of the ancients, to stand like living statues; they were forbidden to
                    turn profile or back to the audience, or to speak up the stage; in some plays,
                    in defiance of the customs of modern mimic art, they wore masks. In spite of
                    public opposition, he put A. W. Schlegel's _Ion_ on the stage--a professedly
                    original play, in reality an unnatural adaptation from Euripides, suggested by
                    _Iphigenia_. Nay, he actually insisted, merely for the sake of exercising the
                    actors in reciting verse, on producing Friedrich Schlegel's _Alarkos_, an
                    utterly worthless piece, which might have been written by a talentless
                    schoolboy, and was certain to be laughed off the stage.[3] To such an extent as
                    this did he gradually sacrifice everything to external artistic form.</p>
                <p>It is easy, then, to see how Goethe's one-sidedness prepared the way for that of
                    the Romanticists; it is not so easy to show that the same was the case with
                    Schiller. Schiller's dramas seem like prophecies of actual events. The French
                    Revolution ferments in _Die Räuber_ (the play which procured for "Monsieur
                    Gille" the title of honorary citizen of the French Republic), and, as Gottschall
                    observes, "the eighteenth Brumaire is anticipated in _Fiesko_, the eloquence of
                    the Girondists in _Posa_, the Cæsarian soldier-spirit in _Wallenstein_, and the
                    Wars of Liberation in _Die Jungfrau von Orleans_ and _Wilhelm Tell_." But in
                    reality it is only in his first dramas that Schiller allows himself to be
                    influenced, without second thought or ulterior purpose, by his theme. In all the
                    later plays the competent critic at once feels how largely the choice of subject
                    has been influenced by considerations of form. Henrik Ibsen once drew my
                    attention to this in speaking of _Die Jungfrau von Orleans_; he maintained that
                    there is no "experience" in that play, that it is not the result of powerful
                    personal impressions, but is a composition. And Hettner has shown this to be the
                    relation of the author to his work in all the later plays. From the year 1798
                    onwards, Schiller's admiration for Greek tragedy led him to be always on the
                    search for subjects in which the Greek idea of destiny prevailed. _Der Ring des
                    Polykrates, Der Taucher_, and _Wallenstein_ are dominated by the idea of
                    Nemesis. Maria Stuart is modelled upon the _Œdipus Rex_ of Sophocles, and this
                    particular historical episode is chosen with the object of having a theme in
                    which the tragic end, the appointed doom, is foreknown, so that the drama merely
                    gradually develops that which is inevitable from the beginning. The subject of
                    the _Jungfrau von Orleans_, in appearance so romantic, is chosen because
                    Schiller desired to deal with an episode in which, after the antique manner, a
                    direct divine message reached the human soul--in which there is a direct
                    material interposition of the divinity, and yet the human being who is the organ
                    of the divinity can be ruined, in genuine Greek fashion, by her human
                    weakness.</p>
                <p>It was only in keeping with his general unrealistic tendency that Schiller,
                    though he was not in the least musical, should extol the opera at the expense of
                    the drama, and maintain the antique chorus to be far more awe-inspiring than
                    modern tragic dialogue. In _Die Braut von Messina_ he himself produced a
                    "destiny" tragedy, which to all intents and purposes is a study in the manner of
                    Sophocles. Not even in _Wilhelm Tell_ is his point of view a modern one; on the
                    contrary, it is in every particular purely Hellenic. The subject is not
                    conceived dramatically, but epically. The individual is marked by no special
                    characteristic. It is merely an accident that raises Tell above the mass and
                    makes him the leader of the movement. He is, as Goethe says, a "sort of Demos."
                    Hence it is not the conflict between two great, irreconcilable historical ideas
                    that is presented in this play; the men of Rütli have no sentimental attachment
                    to liberty; it is neither the idea of liberty nor the idea of country that
                    produces the insurrection. Private ideas and private interests, encroachments on
                    family rights and rights of property, here provide the mainspring of action, or
                    rather of event, which in the other dramas is provided by personal or dynastic
                    ambition. It is explicitly signified to us that the peasants do not aim at
                    acquiring new liberties, but at maintaining old inherited customs. On this point
                    I may refer the reader to Lasalle, who develops the same view with his usual
                    ingenuity in the interesting preface to his drama, _Franz von Sickingen_.</p>
                <p>Thus, then, we see that even when Schiller, the most political and historical of
                    the German poets, appears to be most interested in history and politics, he is
                    dealing only to a limited extent with reality; and therefore it may be almost
                    considered proved, that distaste for historical and present reality--in other
                    words, subjectivism and idealism--were the characteristics of the whole
                    literature of that day.</p>
                <p>But the spirit of Herder, Goethe, and Schiller is only one of the motive powers
                    of Romanticism. The other is the philosophy of Fichte. It was the Fichtean
                    doctrine of the Ego which gave to the Romantic individuality its character and
                    force. The axioms: All that is, is for us; What is for us can only be through
                    us; Everything that is, both natural and supernatural, exists through the
                    _activity of the Ego_, received an entirely new interpretation when transferred
                    from the domain of metaphysics to that of psychology. All reality is contained
                    in the Ego itself, hence the absolute Ego demands that the non-Ego which it
                    posits shall be in harmony with it, and is itself simply the infinite striving
                    to pass beyond its own limits. It was this conclusion of the
                    _Wissenschaftslehre_ (Doctrine of Knowledge) which fired the young generation.
                    By the absolute Ego they understood, as Fichte himself in reality did, though in
                    a very different manner, not a divine being, but the thinking human being. And
                    this new and intoxicating idea of the absolute freedom and power and
                    self-sufficiency of the Ego, which, with the arbitrariness of an autocratic
                    monarch, obliges the whole world to shrink into nothing before itself, is
                    enthusiastically proclaimed by an absurdly arbitrary, ironical, and fantastic
                    set of young geniuses, half-geniuses, and quarter-geniuses. The _Sturm und
                    Drang_ period, when the liberty men gloried in was the liberty of
                    eighteenth--century "enlightenment," reappeared in a more refined and idealistic
                    form; and the liberty now gloried in was nineteenth-century lawlessness.</p>
                <p>Fichte's doctrine of a world-positing, world-creating Ego was at variance with
                    "sound human reason." This was one of its chief recommendations in the eyes of
                    the Romanticists. The _Wissenschaftslehre_ was scientific paradox, but to them
                    paradox was the fine flower of thought. Moreover, the fundamental idea of the
                    doctrine was as radical as it was paradoxical. It had been evolved under the
                    impression of the attempt made by the French Revolution to transform the whole
                    traditional social system into a rational system (Vernunftstaat). The autocracy
                    of the Ego was Fichte's conception of the order of the world, and therefore in
                    this doctrine of the Ego the Romanticists believed that they possessed the lever
                    with which they could lift the old world from its hinges.</p>
                <p>The Romantic worship of imagination had already begun with Fichte. He explained
                    the world as the result of an unconscious, yet to a thinker comprehensible, act
                    of the free, yet at the same time limited, Ego. This act, he maintains, emanates
                    from the creative imagination. By means of it the world which we apprehend with
                    the senses first becomes to us a real world. The whole activity of the human
                    mind, then, according to Fichte, springs from the creative imagination; it is
                    the instinct which he regards as the central force of the active Ego. The
                    analogy with the imaginative power which is so mighty in art is evident. But
                    what Fichte himself failed to perceive is, that imagination is by no means a
                    creative, but only a transforming, remodelling power, since what it acts upon is
                    only the form of the things conceived of, not their substance.</p>
                <p>Fichte says that he "does not require 'things,' and does not make use of them,
                    because they prevent his self-dependence, his independence of all that is
                    outside of himself." This saying is closely allied to Friedrich Schlegel's
                    observation, "that a really philosophic human being should be able to tune
                    himself at will in the philosophical or philological, the critical or poetical,
                    the historical or rhetorical, the ancient or modern key, as one tunes an
                    instrument, and this at any time and to any pitch."</p>
                <p>According to the Romantic doctrine, the artistic omnipotence of the Ego and the
                    arbitrariness of the poet can submit to no law. In this idea lies the germ of
                    the notorious Romantic irony in art, the treating of everything as both jest and
                    earnest, the eternal self-parody, the disturbing play with illusions alternately
                    summoned up and banished, which destroys all directness of effect in many of the
                    favourite works of the Romanticists.</p>
                <p>The Romanticist's theory of art and life thus owes its existence to a mingling of
                    poetry with philosophy, a coupling of the poet's dreams with the student's
                    theories; it is a production of purely intellectual powers, not of any relation
                    between these powers and real life. Hence the excessively intellectual character
                    of Romanticism. Hence all the selfduplication, all the raising to higher powers,
                    in this poetry about poetry and this philosophising on philosophy. Hence its
                    living and moving in a higher world, a different nature. This too is the
                    explanation of all the symbolism and allegory in these half-poetical,
                    half-philosophical works. A literature came into being which partook of the
                    character of a religion, and ultimately joined issue with religion, and which
                    owed its existence rather to a life of emotion than a life of intellectual
                    productiveness. Hence we understand how, as A. W. Schlegel himself says, "it was
                    often rather the ethereal melody of the feelings that was lightly suggested than
                    the feelings themselves that were expressed in all their strength and fulness."
                    It was not the thing itself that the author wished to communicate to the reader,
                    but a suggestion of the thing. It is not in bright sunlight, but in twilight or
                    mysterious quivering moonlight, on a far horizon or in dreams, that we behold
                    the figures of Romanticism. Hence too the Romantic dilution or diminution of the
                    terms expressing what is perceived by the senses (Blitzeln, Aeugeln,
                    Hinschatten), and also that interchange of the terms for the impressions of the
                    different senses, which makes the imagery confusedly vague. In _Zerbino_ Tieck
                    writes of flowers:</p>
                <p> "Die Farbe klingt; die Form ertönt, jedwede Hat nach der Form und Farbe Zung'
                    und Rede. * * * * * * * * * Sich Farbe, Duft, Gesang Geschwister nennen."[4]</p>
                <p>The essential element in this literature is no longer the passion of the _Sturm
                    und Drang_ period, but the free play of fancy, an activity of the imagination
                    which is neither restrained by the laws of reason nor by the relation of feeling
                    to reality. The higher, poetic sequences of ideas now introduced declare war
                    against the laws of thought, ridicule them as philistine. Their place is taken
                    by caprices, conceits, and vagaries. Fancy determines to dispense with reality,
                    but despised reality has its revenge in the unsubstantiality or anæmia of fancy;
                    fancy defies reason, but in this defiance there is an awkward contradiction; it
                    is conscious and premeditated--reason is to be expelled by reason. Seldom has
                    any poetic school worked under such a weight of perpetual consciousness of its
                    own character as did this. Conscious intention is the mark of its
                    productions.</p>
                <p>The intellectual inheritance to which the Romanticists succeeded was
                    overpoweringly great. The School came into existence when literature stood at
                    its zenith in Germany. This explains the early maturity of its members; their
                    way was made ready for them. They assimilated in their youth an enormous amount
                    of literary knowledge and of artistic technique, and thus started with an
                    intellectual capital such as no other young generation in Germany had ever
                    possessed. They clothed their first thoughts in the language of Goethe,
                    Schiller, and Shakespeare, and, beginning thus, proceeded to create what Goethe
                    called "the period of forced talents." For the study of real human character and
                    the execution of definite artistic ideas they substituted the high-handedness of
                    turbulent fancy. Common to all the very dissimilar endeavours and productions of
                    the Romanticists--to Wackenroder's _Klosterbruder_, with its spiritual
                    enthusiasm for art and ideal beauty, to _Lucinde_, with its sensual worship of
                    the flesh, to Tieck's melancholy romances and tales, in which capricious fate
                    makes sport of man, and to Tieck's dramas and Hoffmann's stories, in which all
                    form is lost and its place supplied by the caprices and arabesques of whimsical
                    fancy--common to them all, is that law-defying self-assertion or assertion of
                    the absolutism of the individual, which is a result of war with narrowing prose,
                    of the urgent demand for poetry and freedom.</p>
                <p>The absolute independence of the Ego isolates. Nevertheless these men soon
                    founded a school, and after its speedy disintegration several interesting groups
                    were formed. This is to be ascribed to their determination to make common cause
                    in procuring the victory, insuring the universal dominion, of the philosophy of
                    life which had been evolved by the great minds of Germany. They desired to
                    introduce this philosophy of the geniuses into life itself, to give it
                    expression in criticism, in poetry, in art theories, in religious exhortation,
                    in the solution of social, and even of political problems; and their first step
                    towards this was violent literary warfare. They were impelled partly by the
                    necessity felt by great and strong natures to impart one will and one mind to a
                    whole band of fellow-combatants, and partly by the inclination of men of talent,
                    whose talent is attacked and contested, to confront the overwhelming numbers of
                    their opponents with a small but superior force. In the case of the best men,
                    the formation of a school or a party was the result of exactly that lack of
                    state organisation which was the first condition of their isolating
                    independence. The consciousness of belonging to a people without unity as a
                    nation, and without collective strength, begot the endeavour to imbue the
                    leading spirits of the aristocracy of intellect with a new rallying
                    principle.</p>
                <p>[1] Whence this trembling, this nameless horror, when thy loving arms encircle
                    me? Is it because an oath, which, remember, even a thought is sufficient to

                <p>Because a ceremony, which the laws have decreed to be sacred, has hallowed an

                <p>HÖLDERLIN</p>
                <p>Outside the group which represents the transition from the Hellenism of Goethe
                    and Schiller to Romanticism stands a solitary figure, that of Hölderlin, one of
                    the noblest and most refined intellects of the day. Although their contemporary,
                    he was a pioneer of the German Romanticists, in much the same way as Andre
                    Chenier, another Hellenist, was a pioneer of French Romanticism. He was educated
                    with the future philosopher of the Romantic School, Schelling, and with Hegel,
                    the great thinker, who came after Romanticism, and he was the friend of both of
                    these, but had made acquaintance with none of the Romanticists proper when
                    insanity put an end to his intellectual activity.</p>
                <p>Hölderlin was born in 1770, and became insane in 1802. Hence, although he
                    survived himself forty years, his life as an author is very little longer than
                    Hardenberg's or Wackenroder's.</p>
                <p>That enmity to Hellenism, which to posterity appears one of the chief
                    characteristics of the Romantic movement, was not one of its original elements.
                    On the contrary, with the exception of Tieck, who certainly had no appreciation
                    of the Hellenic spirit, all the early Romanticists, but more especially the
                    Schlegel brothers, Schleiermacher, and Schelling, were enthusiastic admirers of
                    ancient Greece. It was their desire to enter into every feeling of humanity, and
                    it was among the Greeks that they at first found humanity in all its fulness.
                    They longed to break down the artificial social barriers of their time and
                    escape to nature, and at first they found nature among the Greeks alone. To them
                    the genuinely human was at the same time the genuinely Greek. Friedrich
                    Schlegel, for example, embarks on his career with the hope of being for
                    literature all that Winckelmann has been for art. In his essays "On Diotima" and
                    "On the Study of Greek Poetry," he proclaims the superiority of Greek culture
                    and Greek poetry to all other. There is an indication of the later Schlegel in
                    the attempt made to combat the false modesty of modern times, and to prove that
                    beauty is independent of moral laws, which in no way concern art. Characteristic
                    also is his demonstration of Aristotle's lack of appreciation of the Greek
                    _Naturpoesie_.</p>
                <p>A similar but more enduring enthusiasm for ancient Greece was the very essence of
                    Hölderlin's being; and this enthusiasm did not find its expression in studies
                    and essays, but took lyric form, in prose as well as verse. Even as dramatist
                    and novelist, Hölderlin was the gifted lyric poet, that and nothing else. Haym
                    has aptly observed of his romances: "Joy in the ideal, the collapse of the
                    ideal, and grief over that collapse, constitute the theme which the Letters of
                    Hyperion develop with a force which never weakens and a fervour which is always
                    alike intense.... It is the irretrievable that is the cause of his suffering."
                    And since the ideal was embodied for him in Greek life, such as he dreamed it to
                    have been, his whole literary production is one longing lament over lost Hellas.
                    Nothing could be less Greek or more Romantic than this longing; it is of exactly
                    the same exaggerated character as Schack Staffeldt's enthusiasm for ancient
                    Scandinavia and Wackenroder's devotion to German antiquity. Hölderlin's
                    landscapes are as un-Greek as his modern Greeks in _Hyperion_, who are noble
                    German enthusiasts, strongly influenced by Schiller. We cannot doubt that he was
                    aware of this himself. But the lot of the solitary chosen spirits in Germany
                    seemed to him a terrible one. Although he shows himself in his poems to be an
                    ardent patriot, and although he sings the charms of romantic Heidelberg in
                    antique strophes, yet Germany and Greece to him represent barbarism and culture.
                    Concerning his own position to the Greeks he writes to his brother: "In spite of
                    all my good-will, I too, in all that I do and think, merely stumble along in the
                    track of these unique beings; and am often the more awkward and foolish in deed
                    and word because, like the geese, I stand flat-footed in the water of modernity,
                    impotently endeavouring to wing my flight upward towards the Greek heaven." And
                    at the close of _Hyperion_ he says of the Germans: "They have been barbarians
                    from time immemorial, and industry, science, even religion itself, has only made
                    them still more barbarous, incapable of every divine feeling, too utterly
                    depraved to enjoy the happiness conferred by the Graces. With their
                    extravagances and their pettinesses, they are insupportable to every rightly
                    constituted mind, dead and discordant as the fragments of a broken vase." Of
                    German poets and artists he writes, that they present a distressing spectacle.
                    "They live in the world like strangers in their own house ... they grow up full
                    of love and life and hope, and twenty years later one sees them wandering about
                    like shadows, silent and cold."</p>
                <p>Therefore Hölderlin rejoices over the victories of the French, over the "gigantic
                    strides of the Republic," scoffs at all "the petty trickeries of political and
                    ecclesiastical Würtemberg and Germany and Europe," derides the "narrow-minded
                    domesticity" of the Germans, and bewails their lack of any feeling of common
                    honour and common property. "I cannot," he exclaims, "imagine a people more torn
                    asunder than are the Germans. You see artisans, but not men, philosophers, but
                    not men, priests, but not men, servants and masters, young and old, but not
                    men."</p>
                <p>The conception of the State which we find in _Hyperion_ is also quite in harmony
                    with the spirit of the age, and quite un-Hellenic. "The State dare not demand
                    what it cannot take by force. But what love and intellect give cannot be taken
                    by force. It must keep its hands off that, else we will take its laws and
                    pillory them! Good God! They who would make the State a school of morals do not
                    know what a crime they are committing. The State has always become a hell when
                    man has tried to make it his heaven."</p>
                <p>Utterly un-Greek, wholly Romantic, is the love which Hyperion cherishes for his
                    Diotima. It is the same deep and tragic feeling which bound Hölderlin, the poor
                    tutor, to the mother of his pupils, Frau Susette Gontard, and determined his
                    fate. No Greek ever spoke of the woman he loved with the religious adoration
                    which Hölderlin expresses for his "fair Grecian." "Dear friend, there is a being
                    upon this earth in whom my spirit can and will repose for untold centuries, and
                    then still feel how puerile, face to face with nature, all our thought and
                    understanding is." And exactly the same Romantic, Petrarchian note is struck by
                    Hyperion when he speaks of Diotima. Diotima is "the one thing desired by
                    Hyperion's soul, the perfection which we imagine to exist beyond the stars." She
                    is beauty itself, the incarnation of the ideal. Love is to him religion, and his
                    religion is love of beauty. Beauty is the highest, the absolute ideal; it
                    belongs, as a conception, to the world of reason, and as a symbol, to the world
                    of imagination. From his æsthetic point of view, Hölderlin does not perceive
                    that boundary line drawn by Kant between the domains of reason and imagination.
                    His theory, a species of poetic--philosophic ecstasy, having points in common
                    with both Schiller's Hellenism and Schelling's transcendental idealism, is
                    Romantic before the days of Romanticism.</p>
                <p>Germinating Romanticism is also to be traced in the gleam of Christian feeling
                    which tinges his half-modern pantheism. He had been originally destined for the
                    Church, and had suffered much from the severe discipline of the monastery where
                    he was educated. In spite, however, of the many evidences of a pious disposition
                    which we find in his letters, he was a pagan in his poems. He disliked priests,
                    and steadily withstood his family's desire that he should become one. In his
                    _Empedokles_ we come upon the following significant reply of the hero to the
                    priest Hermokrates:--</p>
                <p> "Du weisst es ja, ich hab es dir bedeutet, Ich kenne dich und deine schlimme
                    Zunft. Und lange Avar's ein Räthsel mir, wie euch In ihrem Runde duldet die
                    Natur. Ach, als ich noch ein Knabe war, da mied Euch Allverderber schon mein
                    frommes Herz, Das unbestechbar, innig liebend hing An Sonn' und Aether und den
                    Boten allen Der grossen ferngeahndeten Natur; Denn wohl hab ich's gefühlt in
                    meiner Furcht, Dass ihr des Herzens freie Götterliebe Bereden möchtet zu
                    gemeinem Dienst, Und dass ich's treiben sollte so, wie ihr. Hinweg! ich kann vor
                    mir den Mann nicht sehn, Der Göttliches wie ein Gewerbe treibt, Sein Angesicht
                    ist falsch und kalt und todt, Wie seine Götter sind."[1]</p>
                <p>There is not a trace in Hölderlin of the sanctimonious piety developed by the
                    other Romanticists, who, to begin with, were far more decided free-thinkers than
                    he. Yet his Hellenism is not pagan in the manner of Schiller's and Goethe's.
                    There is a fervency in it which is akin to Christian devotion; his poetic
                    prayers to the sun, the earth, and the air are those of a believer; and when, as
                    in _Empedokles_, he handles a purely pagan subject, the spirit of the treatment
                    is such that we feel (as we do in a later work, Kleist's _Amphitryon_) the
                    Christian legend behind the heathen. The position of Empedokles to the Pharisees
                    of his day and country is exactly that of Jesus to the Pharisees of Judea.
                    Empedokles, like Jesus, is the great prophet, and both his willing sacrificial
                    death and the worship of which he is the object awake feelings which remotely
                    resemble those of the devout Christian.</p>
                <p>In Hölderlin we find in outline, light and delicate as if traced by a spirit,
                    symbols and emotions which the Romantic School develops, exaggerates,
                    caricatures, or simply obliterates.</p>
                <p>[1]</p>
                <p> "'Tis nothing new; this I have told you oft; I know you well, you and your evil
                    kind. And long it was a mystery to me How Nature could endure you in her realm.
                    Corrupters of mankind! Even as a child, My guileless heart shrank from you with
                    distrust-- That honest, fervent heart, that loved the sun, The cool fresh air,
                    and all the messengers Of Nature, dimly discerned and great. For even then I
                    timidly perceived How ye would take our true love of the gods And make it serve
                    some baser, selfish end-- And that in this ye would that I should follow you.
                    Begone! I cannot look upon the man Who practises religion as a trade; His
                    countenance is false and cold and dead, As are his gods."</p>

                <head>III</head>
                <p>A. W. SCHLEGEL</p>
                <p>In 1797, August Wilhelm Schlegel, then aged thirty, published the first volume of
                    his translation of Shakespeare. Rough drafts of several of the plays in this
                    edition have been found, and these faded, dusty manuscripts not only enable us
                    to follow the persevering, talented translator in his self-imposed task, but,
                    when carefully read, give us direct insight into his and his wife's spiritual
                    life, and indeed into the intellectual life of the whole period.[1]</p>
                <p>Even apparently insignificant details are suggestive. The manuscripts are not
                    always in A. W. Schlegel's handwriting. He set to work upon _Romeo and Juliet_
                    in the winter of 1795-96; in 1796 he married Caroline Böhmer; and we have a
                    complete copy of the first rough draft of the play in Caroline's handwriting,
                    with corrections in Schlegel's. In September 1797, as her letters show, she
                    copied _As You Like It_ from an almost illegible manuscript. And she was more
                    than a mere copyist. She collaborated with Schlegel in his essay on _Romeo and
                    Juliet_, which ranks next to Goethe's disquisitions on _Hamlet in Wilhelm
                    Meister_ as the best Shakespeare criticism produced in Germany up to that time.
                    We recognise her now and again in some outburst of womanly feeling, or in a
                    greater freedom of style than we are accustomed to in Schlegel. She had a far
                    truer understanding than her contemporaries of the full significance of a work,
                    the aim of which was the incorporation of Shakespeare in his unalloyed entirety
                    into German literature. But her interest in the work and the labourer did not,
                    as the manuscripts show us, survive the first year of her married life. At first
                    it is her handwriting which predominates, and, though it is less frequently to
                    be seen alongside of her husband's in the manuscripts of those plays with which
                    he was occupied during the years 1797-98, her collaboration is still apparent.
                    We find the last traces of her pen in the manuscript of the _Merchant of
                    Venice_, which dates from the autumn of 1798. In October of that year, Schelling
                    joined the Romanticist circle in Jena. Thenceforward no more of Caroline's
                    handwriting is discoverable.</p>
                <p>Among the manuscripts in question, two give us a very distinct idea of the
                    progress of Schlegel's intellectual development. They are two different texts of
                    the _Midsummer Night's Dream_.</p>
                <p>Before A. W. Schlegel's time no one in Germany, or elsewhere, had attempted to
                    translate Shakespeare line for line. The two tame prose translations by Wieland
                    and Eschenburg were, in fact, all that existed. As a student in Göttingen,
                    Schlegel made the first attempt to reproduce in German verse parts of the
                    _Midsummer Night's Dream_. From childhood he had been "an indefatigable
                    verse-maker." His talent was obviously inherited. Half a century before he and
                    his brother made their appearance, two brothers Schlegel had made a name for
                    themselves in literature--Johann Elias, who lived for many years in Copenhagen,
                    was a friend of Holberg, and, in everything connected with the stage, a
                    forerunner of Lessing, and Johann Adolph, father of August Wilhelm and
                    Friedrich, who, without much originality, possessed decided linguistic and
                    plastic talent.</p>
                <p>As a young student, August Wilhelm, already distinguished by his
                    impressionableness as a stylist and opinionativeness as an author, ardently
                    desired to make the acquaintance of Bürger, who was leading a lonely and unhappy
                    life as professor at the University of Göttingen. Bürger's fame as a poet
                    procured him no consideration in a place where learning alone was valued; his
                    social position had, moreover, been injured by the discovery of his relations
                    with his wife's sister. With the feelings of an exile, he warmly welcomed the
                    distinguished and talented young disciple, whose taste was more correct and
                    whose stores of knowledge were better ordered than his own. At this time Bürger
                    was still considered to be Germany's best lyric poet and most accomplished
                    versifier. Schlegel placed himself under his tuition, and learned all his
                    linguistic and metrical devices, all the methods of producing artistic effects
                    by careful choice and arrangement of words and use of rhythm and metres. With
                    his natural gift of imitation, he appropriated as many of Bürger's
                    characteristics as were at all compatible with his entirely different
                    temperament. His poem _Ariadne_ might have been written by Bürger. Bürger had
                    been particularly successful in the sonnet, a form of poetry which had lately
                    come into vogue in Germany. So closely did the pupil follow in the footsteps of
                    his master, that when, many years later, a complete edition of Schlegel's works
                    was published, two of Bürger's sonnets were accidentally included among
                    them.</p>
                <p>The master did homage to his remarkably promising pupil in a fine sonnet,
                    beginning:--</p>
                <p> "Junger Aar, dein königlicher Flug Wird den Druck der Wolken überwinden, Wird
                    die Bahn zum Sonnentempel finden, Oder Phöbus' Wort in mir ist Lug,"[2]</p>
                <p>and ending with the charmingly modest lines:--</p>
                <p> "Dich zum Dienst des Sonnengotts zu krönen Hielt ich nicht den eignen Kranz zu
                    wert, Doch--dir ist ein besserer beschert."[3]</p>
                <p>Schlegel responded with a criticism of Bürger's frigidly grand _Das hohe Lied von
                    der Einzigen_, which he praises as a magnificent epic. In collaboration with
                    Bürger he now began a translation of the _Midsummer Night's Dream_, of which he
                    did the greater part, Bürger merely revising. He was still completely under his
                    master's influence; the manuscripts show that he always accepted Bürger's
                    corrections and deferred to his predilection for sonority and vigour. As a
                    translator, Bürger took no pains to reproduce Shakespeare's peculiarities as
                    closely as possible; he only manifested his own peculiarities, by making all the
                    coarse, wanton speeches, and the passages in which misguided passions run riot,
                    as prominent as possible; he emphasised and exaggerated everything that appealed
                    to his own liking for a coarse jest, and destroyed the magic of the light and
                    tender passages. In spite of his own great and natural love of refinement, young
                    Schlegel strove in this matter also to follow in his master's steps, with the
                    result that he was not infrequently coarse and awkward where he meant to be
                    natural and vigorous.</p>
                <p>A better guide would have been Herder, who, long before this, in the fragments of
                    Shakespeare plays in his _Stimmen der Völker_, had given an example of the right
                    method of translating from English into German. If Schlegel had taken lessons
                    from Herder in Shakespeare-translating, he would never have rendered five-footed
                    iambics by Alexandrines, nor changed the metre of the fairy-songs. No one had
                    realised the inadequacy of Wieland's translation more clearly than Herder. And
                    now the spirit in which the latter aimed at Germanising Shakespeare descended
                    upon Schlegel, who, in spite of the faults of his first attempts, soon surpassed
                    Herder himself.</p>
                <p>He was not long in shaking himself free from Bürger's influence. To Bürger the
                    highest function of art was to be national and popular. In 1791, Schlegel, now
                    no longer in Bürger's vicinity, but a tutor in Amsterdam, devoted much attention
                    to the works of Schiller. His poetical attempts were henceforth more in the
                    style of that master; he wrote a sympathetic criticism of _Die Künstler_; and he
                    was led to a higher conception of art by the perusal of Schiller's æsthetic
                    writings. His metrical style began to acquire greater dignity. But Schiller was
                    almost as incapable as Bürger of developing in Schlegel a true and full
                    understanding of Shakespeare--Schiller, who, in his translation of Macbeth, had
                    transformed the witches into Greek Furies, and changed the Porter's coarsely
                    jovial monologue into an edifying song. If Bürger's realism was one danger,
                    Schiller's pomposity was another.</p>
                <p>But at the same time that Schiller enlightened Schlegel as to the high
                    significance of art, the newly-published Collected Works of Goethe, whom he only
                    now began to appreciate, stimulated his natural inclination to study, interpret,
                    and make poetical translations. As already mentioned, this first edition of
                    Goethe's collected works met with but a poor reception. The chief reason of this
                    was that the public, understanding nothing of the poet's mental development, had
                    expected new works in the style of _Werther_ or _Götz_. But to Schlegel's
                    critical intellect, Goethe's wonderful many-sidedness was now revealed. He
                    understood and appreciated the artist's capacity of forgetting himself for the
                    moment, of surrendering himself entirely to the influence of his subject, which
                    in Goethe's case produced forms that were never arbitrarily chosen, but
                    invariably demanded by the theme. He understood that he himself, as a poetical
                    translator, must practise the same self-abnegation and develop a similar
                    capacity of intellectual re-creation. Two things were required of the
                    translator, a feminine susceptibility to the subtlest characteristics of the
                    foreign original, and masculine capacity to re-create with the impression of the
                    whole in his mind; and both of these requirements were to be found in Goethe;
                    for his nature was multiplicity, his name "Legion," his spirit Protean.</p>
                <p>There still remained the technical, linguistic difficulties to overcome; and in
                    this, above all, Goethe was an epoch-making model. He had remoulded the German
                    language. In passing through his hands it had gained so greatly in pliability
                    and compass, had acquired such wealth of expression both in the grand and the
                    graceful style, that it offered Schlegel exactly the well-tuned instrument of
                    which he stood in need. While under Bürger's influence he had looked upon
                    technical perfection as a purely external quality, which could be acquired by
                    indefatigable polishing; he now realised that perfect technique has an inward
                    origin, that it is in reality the unity of style which is conditioned by the
                    general cast of a mind. And he began to see that his life task was a double one,
                    namely, to reproduce the masterpieces of foreign races in the German language,
                    and to interpret critically for his countrymen the best literary productions
                    both of Germany and other lands.</p>
                <p>Now, too, Schlegel acquired a quite new understanding of Fichte, the friend and
                    brother-in-arms whom the Romanticists had so quickly won for their cause. He
                    realised that Fichte's doctrine of the Ego contained in extremely abstract terms
                    the idea of the unlimited capacity of the human mind to find itself in
                    everything and to find everything in itself. Round this powerful fundamental
                    thought of Fichte's, August Wilhelm's pliable mind twined itself.</p>
                <p>At this time he was much influenced by the correspondence which he kept up
                    regularly with his younger brother. Friedrich had been drawn by August Wilhelm
                    into the stream of the new literary movement, and his militant disposition made
                    him the most reckless champion of the new principles as soon as he felt assured
                    of their truth. The brothers had very different characters. The elder, in spite
                    of the audacity of his literary views, had the better regulated mind. He had
                    early developed a sense of form and of beauty. His chief gift was a capacity for
                    moulding language; and accuracy, dexterity, and the sense of proportion were
                    qualities he was born with. Except in cases of strong provocation, he showed
                    moderation in scientific and artistic controversy; he knew comparatively early
                    what he desired and what he was capable of; and his determination and
                    perseverance made him a successful pioneer of the ideas and principles of which
                    he had chosen to make himself the spokesman. He became the founder of the
                    Romantic School, an achievement for which he possessed every qualification--this
                    man whom his brother jestingly called "the divine schoolmaster" or "the
                    schoolmaster of the universe."</p>
                <p>Friedrich Schlegel was the more restless spirit, the genuine sect-founder. He
                    himself tells us, in one of his letters, that it was his life-long desire "not
                    only to preach and dispute like Luther, but also, like Mohammed, to subjugate
                    the spiritual realms of the earth with the flaming sword of the word." He did
                    not lack initiative, and abounded in plans so colossal that there was a jarring
                    disproportion between them and his ability to carry them out. Eternally
                    wavering, without tenacity or fundamental conviction, fragmentary in the
                    extreme, but rich in both suggestive and disconcerting ideas and in witty
                    conceits, he was constantly beset by the temptation to silence his opponents
                    with mysterious terminology, and constantly liable to relapse into platitudes
                    and meaningless verbiage. What Novalis once wrote to him was more correct than
                    any one suspected: "The King of Thule, dear Schlegel, was your progenitor; you
                    are related to ruin." As a critic, he was more impulsive and less impartial than
                    August Wilhelm; as a poet, he was only once or twice in his life genuinely
                    natural, and in his _Alarkos_ he plunged into an abyss of bathos into which his
                    brother, with his more correct taste, could never have fallen. The elder brother
                    had started the younger in his literary career; the younger now drove the elder
                    onward, and in the process put an end, by his unamiability, to the latter's
                    friendly relations with Schiller, and, ultimately, even to his valued and long
                    maintained friendship with Goethe.</p>
                <p>August Wilhelm now put his translation of Shakespeare aside for a time, and
                    turned his attention to the poets of the South. He experimented in all
                    directions, translated fragments of Homer, of the Greek elegiac, lyric,
                    dramatic, and idyllic poets, of almost all the Latin poets and many of the
                    Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese. At a later period he even translated Indian
                    poetry, his aim being to make the German language a Pantheon for the divine in
                    every tongue. He lingered longest over Dante, although he did not possess the
                    mastery of form required to render the _terza rima_; he rhymed only two lines of
                    each triplet, thus altering the character of the verse and doing away with the
                    intertwining of the stanzas.</p>
                <p>After this he turned to _Romeo and Juliet_ and _Hamlet_, sending fragments of his
                    translations to Friedrich, who showed them to Caroline. Her judgment was
                    favourable on the whole, but she found fault with the style as being rather
                    antiquated; this she ascribed to Wilhelm's having been lately employed in
                    translating Dante, his ear having thereby become accustomed to obsolete words
                    and expressions. The fact was, that shortly before this he had awakened to the
                    necessity of being on his guard against the elaborate polish which he had made
                    his aim after giving up Bürger's style; he now fell into the other extreme,
                    became archaic, rugged, and hard.</p>
                <p>In 1797 Schlegel sent the first samples of _Romeo and Juliet_ to Schiller. They
                    were printed in _Die Horen_; and in the same periodical there presently also
                    appeared his essay, _Etwas über William Shakespeare bei Gelegenheit Wilhelm
                    Meisters_. In _Wilhelm Meister_ Goethe had proclaimed the endeavour to
                    understand Shakespeare to be an important element in German culture. In its
                    conversations on _Hamlet_ he had refuted the foolish theory that the great
                    dramatist was an uncultivated natural genius, destitute of artistic
                    consciousness. Had such been the case, the exact reproduction of his style would
                    not have been a matter of vital importance in a German translation. But with so
                    great an artist as the Shakespeare presented to us in _Wilhelm Meister_, it was
                    plain that the harmony between subject and form must not be deranged. And yet
                    even Goethe himself had, without any feeling of unsuitability, given his
                    quotations from _Hamlet_ in the old prose translation; even he had not realised
                    how inseparably matter and manner are connected.</p>
                <p>Slowly and laboriously Schlegel progresses. His judgment is still so defective
                    that he fancies it impossible to dispense with Alexandrines; in _Romeo and
                    Juliet_, he retains the five-footed iambics only "as far as possible"; the scene
                    between Romeo and Friar Laurence he renders in Alexandrines, excusing himself
                    with the remark that this metre is less detrimental in speeches garnished with
                    maxims and descriptions than in the dialogue proper of the drama. The result is
                    the loss of Romeo's lyric fervour.</p>
                <p>He feels this himself, and with iron industry and determined enthusiasm sets to
                    work again, rejects the Alexandrines, and compels himself, in spite of the
                    verbosity of the German language, to say in ten or eleven syllables what he had
                    said before in twelve or thirteen. For long it appears to him an impossible task
                    to reproduce each line by one line. The translation swells in his hands as it
                    did in Bürger's. Fourteen English lines become nineteen or twenty German. It
                    seems to him that it is impossible to do with less; until at last he gains true
                    insight, and sees, from the very foundation, how Shakespeare raises the edifice
                    of his art. Now he renounces all amplitude and all redundancy that is not in
                    Shakespeare. Each line is rendered by a single line. He curses and bewails the
                    prolixity and inadequacy of German: his language has such different limits, such
                    different turns of expression from the English language; he cannot reproduce
                    Shakespeare's style; what he produces is a stammer, a stutter, without resonance
                    or fire--but he coerces himself, he coerces the language, and produces his
                    translation.</p>
                <p>There is no great exaggeration in Scherer's dictum: "Schlegel's Shakespeare takes
                    its place beside the works given to the world by Goethe and Schiller during the
                    period when they worked in fellowship; there is the inevitable distance between
                    reproductive and productive art, but there is the nearness of the perfect to the
                    perfect."</p>
                <p>Having acquired complete mastery of the style, Schlegel now began to reap the
                    fruits of his labour. He, the master, opened his hand, and between the years
                    1797 and 1801 let fall from it into the lap of the German people sixteen of
                    Shakespeare's dramas, which, in spite of occasional tameness or constraint of
                    style, might, in their new form, have been the work of a German poet of
                    Shakespeare's rank.</p>
                <p>Let us consider what this really means. It means not much less than that
                    Shakespeare, as well as Schiller and Goethe, saw the light in Germany in the
                    middle of last century. He was born in England in 1564; he was born again, in
                    his German translator, in 1767. _Romeo and Juliet_ was published in London in
                    1597; it reappeared in Berlin as a new work in 1797.</p>
                <p>When Shakespeare thus returned to life in Germany, he acted with full force upon
                    a public which was in several ways more capable of understanding him than his
                    original public, though it was spiritually less akin to him and though they were
                    not the battles of its day which he fought. He now began to feed the millions
                    who did not understand English with his spiritual bread. Not until now did
                    Central and Northern Europe discover him. Not until now did the whole
                    Germanic-Gothic world become his public.</p>
                <p>But we have also seen how much went to the production of an apparently
                    unpretending literary work of this high rank. In its rough drafts and
                    manuscripts we may read great part of the intellectual history of a whole
                    generation. Before it could come into existence nothing less was required than
                    that Lessing's criticism and Wieland's and Eschenburg's attempts should prepare
                    the soil, and that a genius like Herder should concentrate in himself all the
                    receptivity and ingenuity of surmise belonging to the German mind, and should,
                    with the imperiousness characteristic of him, oblige young Goethe to become his
                    disciple. But Goethe in his prose _Götz_ only imitated a prose Shakespeare.
                    There had to be born a man with the unique talent of A. W. Schlegel, and he,
                    with his hereditary linguistic and stylistic ability, had to be placed in a
                    position to acquire the greatest technical perfection of the period. Then he had
                    to free himself, by the influence of Schiller's noble conception of art, from
                    the tendency to coarseness which was the result of Bürger's influence, and at
                    the same time to steer clear of Schiller's tendency to pomposity and dislike of
                    wanton joviality, had to gain a complete understanding of Goethe, to enter into
                    possession, as it were, of the language which Goethe had developed, and to
                    attain to an even clearer conviction than his of the essentiality of the harmony
                    of subject and style in Shakespeare. It was necessary, too, that he should be
                    stimulated by the ardour of a kindred talent and assisted by the keen criticism
                    of a woman. Hundreds of sources had to flow into each other, hundreds of
                    circumstances to coincide, of people to make each other's acquaintance, of minds
                    to meet and fertilise each other, before this work, in its modest perfection,
                    could be given to the world; a small thing, the translation of a poet who had
                    been dead for two hundred years, it yet provided the most precious spiritual
                    nourishment for millions, and exercised a deep and lasting influence on German
                    poetry.</p>

                <p>TIECK AND JEAN PAUL</p>
                <p>An apprehensive disposition, predisposing to hallucinations, congenital
                    melancholy, at times verging on insanity, a clear, sober judgment, ever inclined
                    to uphold the claims of reason, and a very unusual capacity for living in and
                    producing emotional moods--such were the principal characteristics of Ludwig
                    Tieck. He was the most productive author of the Romantic School, and, after its
                    disruption, he wrote a long series of excellent novels, depicting past and
                    present more realistically than Romantic writers were in the habit of doing.</p>
                <p>The son of a ropemaker, he was born in Berlin in 1773. Even as a school-boy he
                    was profoundly influenced by classic writers like Goethe, Shakespeare, and
                    Holberg. He early succeeded in imitating both Shakespeare's elfin songs and
                    Ossian's melodious sadness; but during one period of his youth he weakly allowed
                    himself to be exploited by elder men of letters, at whose instigation he
                    produced quantities of carelessly written, unwholesome literature. Though the
                    spirit and tendency of his writings were prescribed for him, his characteristic
                    qualities are, nevertheless, discernible even in these valueless early works.
                    Under the direction of his teacher, Rambach, he wrote, or re-modelled in the
                    spirit of the "enlightenment" period, sentimental tales of noble brigands, and
                    invented gruesome episodes in the style of the death-scene of Franz Moor. But
                    now and again, in some ironical aside, we get a glimpse of his own more advanced
                    ideas.</p>
                <p>A little later we find the future Romanticist writing precocious stories for the
                    almanacs published by Nicolai, that old firebrand of the "enlightenment"
                    period--stories in which superstition is held up to ridicule, and in which we
                    only very occasionally come upon a touch of irony, such as the selection of a
                    particularly inane old man to express contempt for "the stupid Middle Ages" and
                    "Shakespeare's ghosts." No doubt Tieck wrote these compositions principally
                    because he had sold his pen; still they none the less betray the weariness of
                    the desponder, who is so exhausted by his long struggle with questions and
                    doubts of every kind, that he can, without any great reluctance, side with those
                    who depreciate genius and sing the praises of the sensible, bourgeois golden
                    mean. His unsettled mental condition is shown no less clearly in his
                    rationalistic tales than in the supernaturalism, the voluptuous cruelty, and the
                    cold cynicism of the novels and plays dating from the beginning of the Nineties,
                    in which he seems to give us more of himself.</p>
                <p>Tieck's first work of any importance is _William Lovell_. The first part of this
                    novel, which he wrote at the age of twenty, appeared in 1795. In it, when
                    treating of art, he already occasionally touched the strings upon which the
                    Romantic School subsequently played.</p>
                <p>William Lovell goes to Paris (which Tieck at that time had not seen), and is, of
                    course, disgusted with everything there. "The town is a hideous, irregular pile
                    of stones. One has the feeling of being in a great prison.... People chatter and
                    talk all day long without so much as once saying what they think.... I
                    occasionally went to the theatre, simply because time hung so heavily on my
                    hands. The tragedies consist of epigrams, without action or passion, and tirades
                    which produce much the same effect as the words issuing from the mouths of the
                    figures in old drawings.... The less natural an actor is, the more highly is he
                    esteemed. In the great, world-renowned Paris Opera--I fell asleep." Such are the
                    impressions made upon Lovell (an Englishman) by Paris at the time of the
                    Revolution. It is nothing but an expression of the prevalent German contempt for
                    the French character and French art, doubly unreasonable in this case because it
                    has simply been learned by rote out of books. In the Théâtre Français, however,
                    Lovell ejaculates: "O Sophocles! O divine Shakespeare!" and he
                    characteristically observes: "I hate the men who, with their little imitation
                    sun (namely, reason), light up all the pleasant twilight corners and chase away
                    the fascinating shadow phantoms which dwelt so securely under the leafy
                    canopies. There is, undoubtedly, a kind of daylight in our times, but the night
                    and morning light of romance were more beautiful than this grey light from a
                    cloudy sky."</p>
                <p>[Illustration: LUDWIG TIECK]</p>
                <p>With the exception of a few such touches, this work seems at the first glance to
                    be distinguished by none of the peculiarities one is accustomed to associate
                    with a Romantic production; but, as a matter of fact, there is no book which
                    reveals to us more distinctly the foundations on which the Romantic movement
                    rests. The main idea and the form of _William Lovell_ (it is written in letters)
                    were both borrowed from a French novel, _Le Paysan Perverti_, by the
                    materialistic writer, Rétif de la Bretonne. The fact that we are able to trace
                    the origin of a Romantic work directly to French materialism is not without
                    significance; it is in reality from this materialism that the Romanticists
                    derive their gloomy fatalism. _Lovell_ is an extremely tedious book to read
                    nowadays; the style is tiresomely diffuse, the characters are as if lost in
                    mist. Some of the subordinate figures, the devoted old man-servant, for
                    instance, are weak imitations of Richardson--there is not a trenchant trait nor
                    a dramatic situation in the whole book. Its merit, which is as German as are its
                    defects, lies in its psychology. The hero is a youth who is led, slowly and
                    surely, to do away, as far as he himself is concerned, with all authority, to
                    disregard every one of the traditional, accepted rules of life, until at last he
                    is leading the life, not only of a confirmed egotist, but of a criminal.</p>
                <p>It is a mistake to feel surprised that so young a man as Tieck could depict such
                    a being. Is it not precisely at this early age, when his spiritual eyesight does
                    not yet enable him to look abroad, that the youth is constantly occupied with
                    all the strange things he sees when he looks into his own heart? Is it not then
                    that he is impelled to unravel himself, to examine his own condition, to look at
                    himself perpetually in the mirror held out to him by his own consciousness? With
                    men of a certain disposition there is no more self-critical age than twenty or
                    thereabouts. There is still so much of life before one then, so much time to do
                    one's work in; one spends the days in learning to know the instrument upon which
                    one is to play for the rest of one's life, in tuning it, or finding out how it
                    is already tuned. The time is still distant when the mature man will seize upon
                    that instrument, which is himself, and use it--as a violin or as a
                    sledge-hammer, according to the requirements of the situation. And if
                    surrounding circumstances offer neither tasks nor sustenance, and the Ego is
                    obliged to go on living upon its own substance, the result will inevitably be
                    the exhaustion, the demolition of the personality.</p>
                <p>What is peculiarly characteristic of author, tendency, and period, is the
                    sentimental extravagance to which this introspection leads. In all seriousness
                    the individual dares to make his fortuitous Ego, which has disorganised
                    everything that established custom requires men to respect, the standard of
                    everything, the source of all laws. Here we have unmistakably a distortion of
                    Fichte's fundamental idea. Read the following verses from _Lovell_ and the
                    succeeding reflection:--</p>
                <p> "Willkommen, erhabenster Gedanke, Der hoch zum Gotte mich erhebt.</p>
                <p> Die Wesen sind, weil wir sie dachten, In trüber Ferne liegt die Welt, Es fällt
                    in ihre dunkeln Schachten Ein Schimmer, den wir mit uns brachten. Warum sie
                    nicht in wide Trümmer fällt? Wir sind das Schicksal, das sie aufrecht hält!</p>
                <p> Den bangen Ketten froh entronnen Geh' ich nun kühn durchs Leben him, Den harten
                    Pflichten abgewonnen, Von feigen Thoren nur ersonnen. Die Tugend ist nur, weil
                    ich selber bin, Ein Wiederschein in meinem innem Sinn.</p>
                <p> Was kümmern mich Gestalten, deren matten Lichtglanz ich selbst hervorgebracht?
                    Mag Tugend sich und Laster gatten! Sie sind nur Dunst und Nebelschatten, Das
                    Licht aus mir fällt in die finstre Nacht. Die Tugend ist nur, weil ich sie
                    gedacht."[1]</p>
                <p>"My outer self thus rules the material, my inner self the spiritual world.
                    Everything is subject to my will; I can call every phenomenon, every action what
                    I please; the animate and the inanimate world are in leading-strings which are
                    controlled by my mind; my whole life is only a dream, the many forms in which I
                    mould according to my will. I myself am the only law in all nature, and
                    everything obeys this law."</p>
                <p>When Friedrich Schlegel exclaims, "Fichte is not a sufficiently absolute idealist
                    ... I and Hardenberg (Novalis) are more what idealists ought to be," we remember
                    that ten years previously, and long before there was any talk of Romanticism and
                    Romanticists, Tieck had perceived what were to be the characteristics of the new
                    school, i.e. personal lawlessness, and the glorification of this lawlessness,
                    under the name of imagination, as the source of life and art. Lovell is an
                    extravagant personification of these characteristics. Kierkegaard's Johannes the
                    Seducer, the most perfect and the last example of the type in Danish literature,
                    always keeps within certain bounds; he evades ethical questions, looking upon
                    morality as a tiresome, troublesome power, and never attacking it directly; but
                    Lovell, the more many-sided, the more boldly planned, if less skilfully
                    worked-out character, recoils neither from treachery, nor bloodshed, nor poison.
                    He is one of this period's many variations of the Don Juan-Faust type, with a
                    touch of Schiller's Franz Moor. Satiety of self-contemplation has, in his case,
                    led to a boundless contempt for mankind, to a ruthless sweeping away of all
                    illusions; the one and only consolation being that thus hypocrisy is unveiled
                    and the ugly truth seen. There is a close analogy with much that the
                    Romanticists subsequently wrote in such an utterance as this: "Voluptuousness is
                    undoubtedly the great mystery of our being; even the purest and most fervent
                    love dives into this pool.... Only ruthlessness, only a clear perception of the
                    illusion can save us; Amalie is, therefore, nothing to me, now that I see that
                    poetry, art, and even love, are only draped and veiled sensuality.... Sensuality
                    is the driving-wheel of the whole machinery ... voluptuousness is the
                    inspiration of music, of painting, of all the arts; all human desires flutter
                    round this magnetic pole, like moths round a candle;... hence it is that
                    Boccaccio and Ariosto are the greatest poets, and that Titian and the wanton
                    Correggio stand high above Domenichino and pious Raphael. Even religious
                    devotion I consider to be only a diverted course of that sensual instinct which
                    is refracted in a thousand different colours." One would expect this Lovell, in
                    whose meditations sensuality plays so great a part, to be represented as a man
                    whose instincts lead him far astray. Not at all! He is as cold as ice, as cold
                    as Kierkegaard's shadow of a seducer, whom he in this particular anticipates. He
                    does not commit his excesses with his flesh and blood, but with his
                    fantastically excited brain. He is a purely intellectual being, a North German
                    of the purest water. And there is one particular in which he is, in
                    anticipation, astonishingly Romantic. When he has, so to speak, burned himself
                    out, when every spark of conviction is extinguished in his mind, and all his
                    feelings lie "slain and dead" around him, he seeks refuge in the supernatural
                    and places his trust in mystic revelations, of which an old impostor has held
                    out the prospect. This trait, which, significantly enough, is not to be found in
                    his French prototype, was necessary to complete the character.</p>
                <p>The personality here is so hollow, weighs so light in its own estimation, that
                    the impression it produces on itself is, that it is both real and unreal; it has
                    become unfamiliar to itself, and has as little confidence in itself as in any
                    exterior power. It stands outside its own experiences, and when it acts, feels
                    as if it were playing a part. Lovell tells us how he seduced a young girl, Emily
                    Burton: "I suddenly cast myself at her feet, and confessed that it was nothing
                    but my passionate love for her which had brought me to the castle; I declared
                    that this was to be my last attempt to learn if there were any human heart that
                    would still come to my aid and reconcile me to life and fate. She was beautiful,
                    and I acted my part with wonderful inspiration, exactly as if it were a
                    congenial rôle in a play; every word I said told; I spoke with fire and yet
                    without affectation." And later he remarks: "She has herself to reproach for any
                    temporary loss of home happiness; I am not to blame because, in accordance with
                    conventional ideas, she is at present disgraced in the eyes of many. I played
                    one part, she answered with another; we acted the play of a very stupid writer
                    with great seriousness, and now we regret having wasted our time." The whole was
                    nothing but a scene from a play.</p>
                <p>In this fictitious character there are already developed those qualities which we
                    find later in real characters, such as Friedrich Schlegel and Gentz; and in this
                    one man's habit of mind we have all that, which, transferred to art, became the
                    notorious irony of Romanticism. Here, in the character, is the undisguised
                    egotism which looks upon life as a rôle; there, in art, the misconception and
                    exaggeration of Schiller's idea that artistic activity is "a game," a play, i.e.
                    an activity without any outward aim--in short, the belief that true art is that
                    which perpetually shatters its own edifice, renders illusion impossible, and
                    ends, like Tieck's comedies, in self-parody. There is the very closest
                    resemblance between the manner in which the hero acts and the manner in which
                    the comedy is written. The irony is one and the same; it may all be traced back
                    to the same egotism and unreality.[2]</p>
                <p>In order really to understand the psychological condition depicted in Lovell, we
                    must not only see its ultimate consequences, but must also, as in the case of
                    René, see how it originates and what conditions it. It is conditioned by the
                    ferment of lawlessness distinctive of the period. Hence the most diverse
                    creative minds co-operate in the production of the type. As a Titan of satiety,
                    of _tædium vitæ_, Lovell is only one of a race of Titans.</p>
                <p>Two years before _Lovell_ was planned, Jean Paul, who was ten years older than
                    Tieck and four years younger than Schiller, began a description of this race in
                    his so-called "Faustiade," the novel _Titan_. Jean Paul is in many ways the
                    forerunner of Romanticism; in the Romantic School Hoffmann recalls him to us, as
                    Tieck recalls Goethe. He is a thorough Romanticist in the absolute arbitrariness
                    with which, as an artist, he sets to work. As Auerbach says, he has "in
                    readiness studies of men, moods, traits of character, psychological
                    complications, and miscellaneous imagery, which he introduces at random,
                    adjusting them to given characters or situations." He thrusts all kinds of
                    irrelevant matter into the elastic framework of his story. He is, further, a
                    Romanticist in his absorption in self--for it is himself, always himself, who
                    speaks by the mouth of his characters, whatever they may be; in the famous
                    humour which with him lords it over all else, respecting none of the conventions
                    of style; and, finally, in the fact that he is the antipodes of classical
                    culture. But, whatever he may have been in art, in life he was not the defender
                    of lawlessness, but the ardent champion of liberty, Fichte's equal in
                    enthusiastic persistence. He was neither the foe of enlightenment, nor of
                    reason, nor of the Reformation, nor of the Revolution; he was convinced of the
                    historical value and the full validity of the ideas which it is the glory of the
                    eighteenth century to have produced and championed. Therefore he uplifted a
                    warning voice against the futile, demoralising fantasticality of the
                    Romanticists.</p>
                <p>_Titan_ contains the most powerful of Jean Paul's ideal characters, Roquairol.
                    His strength did not lie in the delineation of ideal characters; he was first
                    and foremost the admirable, realistic idyll-writer.</p>
                <p>Roquairol is a prototype of the form in which the age moulded its passion and its
                    despair. He is burning, conscious desire, which develops into fantastic
                    eccentricity, because circumstances have no use for it, and because it does not
                    possess the power to take hold of reality, re-mould it and subject it to itself;
                    it becomes a disease, which strikes inwards and leads to morbid
                    self-contemplation and suicide. Roquairol describes himself in a letter
                    (_Titan_, iii. _Zykel_, 88)</p>
                <p>"Look at me when I take off my mask! My face twitches convulsively, like the face
                    of a man who has taken poison. I have indeed taken poison; I have swallowed the
                    great poison ball, the ball called Earth.... I am like a hollow tree, charred by
                    a _fantastic fire_. When the worms in the intestines of the Ego--anger, ecstasy,
                    love, and the like--begin to crawl about in me and devour each other, I look
                    down upon them from the height of my Ego, I cut them in pieces as if they were
                    polypi and fasten them into each other. Then I look on at myself looking on.
                    This repeats itself _ad infinitum_. What is the use of it all? Mine is not the
                    usual idealism, the idealism of faith; mine is _an idealism of the heart_,
                    peculiar to those who have often experienced all the emotions, on the stage, on
                    paper, or in real life. But of what good is it?... I often look upon the
                    mountains and the rivers and the ground round about me, and feel as if at any
                    moment they might dissolve and disappear, and I with them.... There is in man a
                    callous, bold spirit, which asserts its independence of everything, even of
                    virtue. Man chooses virtue if he will; he is its creator, not its creature. I
                    once experienced a storm at sea, when the raging, foaming waters lashed
                    themselves into great crested billows, while from a calm sky the sun serenely
                    looked on. So be it with you! The heart is the storm, the sky the Ego!... Do you
                    believe that the authors of tragedies and novels, or at any rate the geniuses
                    among them, who a thousand times over have aped everything human and divine, are
                    different from me? What really sustains them and the others is their hunger for
                    money and renown.... The apes are the geniuses amongst the beasts, and geniuses
                    are apes in their æsthetic mimicry, in heartlessness, malignity, sensuality,
                    and--gaiety."</p>
                <p>He relates how an inclination which was simply the result of ennui had led him to
                    seduce his friend's sister. "I lost nothing; in me there is no innocence. I
                    gained nothing, for I hate sensual pleasure. The broad black shadow which some
                    call remorse quickly blotted out the fleeting bright picture of the
                    magic-lantern; but is the black worse for the eyes than the bright?"</p>
                <p>He who reflects carefully upon even these short extracts from Jean Paul's huge
                    four-volume novel will see how here again a connecting line is drawn between
                    life and art. Without premeditation, but very significantly, Roquairol takes the
                    nature of the productive artist as an image of his own, and the expressions
                    "charred by fantastic fire" and "the idealism of the heart" are as accurate as
                    scientific definitions. There was no doubt in the author's mind as to what it
                    was he wished to delineate. Roquairol, after committing his last and most
                    abominable crime, namely, visiting Linda by night, disguised as his friend and
                    her lover, Albano, is made to die by his own hand on the stage. He is playing a
                    part which ends in suicide, and he shoots himself dead. He lives to the last
                    moment in a world of appearances and make-believe, confusing or blending the
                    real with the imaginary. And this determination to make reality fantastic or
                    poetical is the distinguishing feature of the succeeding generation, the task to
                    which it set itself, the problem which all its productions were attempts to
                    solve. To understand this is to understand and excuse the blunders it makes in
                    its schemes for the remoulding of reality, such a scheme, for instance, as we
                    find in Friedrich Schlegel's _Lucinde_.</p>
                <p>The great question of the relation of poetry to life, despair over the deep,
                    bitter discord between them, the unwearied struggle to bring about a
                    reconciliation--this is what lies at the foundation of the whole of German
                    literature from the _Sturm und Drang_ period to the death of Romanticism. In
                    order, therefore, to understand _Lucinde_, as well as _Lovell_, it is necessary
                    to look back. We understand both better by the help of Jean Paul's _Titan_.
                    Lovell's predecessor is the Titan Roquairol, Lucinde's the Titaness Linda.</p>

                    life, absolved from those irksome duties which were the invention of cowardly
                    fools. Virtue is, because I am; it is but the reflection of my inner self.--What
                    care I for forms which borrow their dim splendour from myself? Let virtue wed
                    with vice! They are but shadows in the mist. The light that illumines the dark
                    night comes from me. Virtue is, because I have thought it."</p>

                <p>SOCIAL ENDEAVOURS OF THE ROMANTICISTS: LUCINDE</p>
                <p>At the University of Jena, in June 1801, a young candidate for the degree of
                    doctor stood on the rostrum delivering his thesis. Everything possible was done
                    to put him out and annoy him; the unprecedented step was taken of providing
                    opponents. One of these, a somewhat inept young man, desiring to distinguish
                    himself, began: "_In tractatu tuo erotico Lucinda dixisti_," &amp;c., &amp;c. To
                    this the candidate shortly responded by calling his opponent a fool. A regular
                    uproar ensued, and one of the professors indignantly declared that it was thirty
                    years since the platform of the school of philosophy had been profaned by such
                    disgraceful behaviour. The candidate retorted that it was thirty years since any
                    one had been so disgracefully treated. This candidate was Friedrich Schlegel, in
                    those days so much dreaded on account of his terrible opinions that he was
                    sometimes refused permission to spend a night in a town. In a rescript from the
                    _Universitets-Kuratorium_ of the Electorate of Hanover to the Pro-Rector of
                    Göttingen, dated September 26, 1800, we read: "Should the Professor's brother,
                    Friedrich Schlegel, notorious for the immoral tendency of his writings, come to
                    Göttingen, purposing to stay there for any time, this is not to be permitted;
                    you will be so good as to intimate to him that he must leave the town."</p>
                <p>Somewhat harsh justice this--and all the to-do was on account of _Lucinde_!</p>
                <p>It is not the creative power displayed in it which makes _Lucinde_ one of the
                    most important works of the Romantic School, for, in spite of all the "fleshly"
                    talk in the book, there is no flesh and blood in it, no real body. Neither is it
                    depth of thought. There is more philosophy in the few paradoxical pages written
                    by Schopenhauer under the title _Metaphysik der Liebe_ than in pretentious
                    _Lucinde_ from beginning to end. It is not even a bacchantic joy in nature, in
                    life. If we compare it with Heine's _Ardinghello_, a book glowing with genuine
                    Southern joy of life, we see clearly how anæmic and theoretic _Lucinde_ is. It
                    is as a manifesto and programme that the book is valuable. Its main idea is to
                    proclaim the unity and harmony of life as revealed to us most clearly and most
                    comprehensibly in the passion of love, which gives a sensual expression to the
                    spiritual emotion, and spiritualises the sensual pleasure. What it aims at
                    depicting is the transformation of real life into poetry, into art, into
                    Schiller's "play" of powers, into a dreamy, imaginative existence, with every
                    longing satisfied, a life in which man, acting with no aim, living for no
                    purpose, is initiated into the mysteries of nature, "understands the plaint of
                    the nightingale, the smile of the new-born babe, and all that is mysteriously
                    revealed in the hieroglyphics of flowers and stars."</p>
                <p>This book is totally misunderstood by those who, like Kierkegaard, arm themselves
                    with a whole set of dogmatic principles, and fall upon it, exclaiming: "What it
                    aims at is the unmitigated sensuality which excludes the element of
                    spirituality; what it combats is the spirituality which includes an element of
                    sensuality." One can scarcely realise the blindness implied by such an
                    utterance--but there are no better blinders than those provided by orthodoxy.
                    Nor is it possible really to understand _Lucinde_ so long as, like Gutzkow, we
                    only see in it a vindication of the doctrine of free love, or, like
                    Schleiermacher, a protest against incorporeal spirituality, a denunciation of
                    the affected foolishness that denies and explains away flesh and blood. The
                    fundamental idea of the book is the Romantic doctrine of the _identity of life
                    and poetry_. This serious thought, however, is presented in a form expressly
                    calculated to win the laurels of notoriety. Our admiration is aroused by the
                    bold, defiant tone of the author's challenge, by the courage, born of
                    conviction, with which he exposes himself to personal insult, and to public,
                    ill-natured discussion of his private life.</p>
                <p>[Illustration: F. SCHLEGEL.]</p>
                <p>Worthy of admiration, too, is the skill with which the different views and
                    watchwords of Romanticism are collected and presented to us in small compass;
                    for all the various tendencies of the movement, developed by so many different
                    individuals, are to be seen in this one book, spreading fan-wise from a centre.
                    But we are disgusted by the artistic impotence to which the so-called novel, in
                    reality a mere sketch, bears witness, by its many beginnings that end in
                    nothing, and by all the feeble self-worship which seeks to disguise barrenness
                    by producing an artificial and unhealthy heat in which to hatch its unfertile
                    eggs. Caroline Schlegel has preserved for us the following biting epigram,
                    written soon after the book came out--</p>
                <p> "Der Pedantismus bat die Phantasie Um einen Kuss, sie wies ihn an die Sünde;
                    Frech, ohne Kraft, umarmt er die, Und sie genas mit einem todten Kinde, Genannt
                    Lucinde."[1]</p>
                <p>Beyond considering the word "sin" inappropriate--for _Lucinde_ only sins against
                    good taste and true poetry--I have no fault to find with this cruel satire.</p>
                <p>At the very core of _Lucinde_ we have once again subjectivity, self-absorption,
                    in the form of an arbitrariness which may develop into anything--revolution,
                    effrontery, bigotry, reaction--because it is not from the beginning associated
                    with anything that is a power, because the Ego does not act in the service of an
                    idea which could give to its endeavour stability and value; it acts neither in
                    the service of civil nor of intellectual liberty. This arbitrariness or
                    lawlessness, which, in the domain of art, becomes the Friedrich Schlegelian
                    "irony," the artist's attitude of aloofness from his subject, his free play with
                    it (resulting, as far as poetry is concerned, in the dictatorship of pure form,
                    which mocks at its own substance and destroys its own illusions), becomes in the
                    domain of real life an irony which is the dominant feature in the characters and
                    lives of the gifted few, the aristocracy of intellect. This irony is a riddle to
                    the profane, who "lack the sense of it." It is "the freest of all licences,"
                    because by its means a man sets himself outside of and above himself; yet it is
                    also the most subject to law, being, we are told, unqualified and inevitable. It
                    is a perpetual self-parody, incomprehensible to "the harmonious vulgar"
                    (_harmonisch Platten_--the name bestowed by the Romanticists on those who live
                    contentedly in a trivial, common-place harmony), who mistake its earnest for
                    jest and its jest for earnest.</p>
                <p>It is not merely in name that this irony bears a fundamental resemblance to
                    Kierkegaard's, which also aristocratically "chooses to be misunderstood." The
                    Ego of genius is the truth, if not in the sense in which Kierkegaard would have
                    us understand his proposition, "Subjectivity is the truth," still in the sense
                    that the Ego has every externally valid commandment and prohibition in its
                    power; and, to the astonishment and scandal of the world, invariably expresses
                    itself in paradoxes. Irony is "divine audacity." In audacity thus comprehended
                    there are endless possibilities. It is freedom from prejudice, yet it suggests
                    the possibility of the most audacious defence of all possible kinds of
                    prejudices. It is more easily attainable, we are told, by woman than by man.
                    "Like the feminine garb, the feminine intellect has this advantage over the
                    masculine, that its possessor by a single daring movement can rise above all the
                    prejudices of civilisation and bourgeois conventionality, at once transporting
                    herself into the state of innocence and the lap of Nature." The lap of Nature!
                    There is an echo of Rousseau's voice even in this wanton tirade. We seem to hear
                    the trumpet-call of revolution; what we really hear is only the proclamation of
                    reaction. Rousseau desired to return to the state of nature, when men roamed
                    naked through the pathless forests and lived upon acorns. Schelling wished to
                    turn the course of evolution back to the primeval ages, to the days before man
                    had fallen. Schlegel blows revolutionary melodies on the great romantic
                    "wonder-horn." But, as we read in _Des Knaben Wunderhorn_: "Es blies ein Jäger
                    wohl in sein Horn--Und Alles was er blies, das war verlorn."[2] The result is
                    not intellectual emancipation, but simply a refinement of pleasure. The whole
                    wide domain of love is transformed into the domain of art. As Romantic poetry is
                    poetry to the second power, poetry about poetry, refined and chastened poetry,
                    so the love of the Romanticists is refined and chastened love, "the art of
                    love." The different degrees of the higher sensuality are described and
                    classified. I refer the reader to _Lucinde_, which does not, like _Ardinghello_,
                    present us with voluptuous descriptions, but merely with dry, pedantic theory,
                    the empty framework of which it is left to the reader's experience and
                    imagination to fill. Romantic audacity is, in one of its aspects, idleness, the
                    indolence of genius. Idleness is described as "the life-atmosphere of innocence
                    and inspiration." In its highest expression it is pure passivity, the life of
                    the plant. "The highest, most perfect life is a life of pure vegetation." The
                    Romanticists return to nature to such good purpose that they revert to the
                    plant. Passive enjoyment of the eternally enduring moment would be their idea of
                    perfection. "I meditated seriously," says Julius to Lucinde, "upon the
                    possibility of an eternal embrace." As genius, which is independent of toil and
                    trouble, and voluptuous enjoyment, which in itself is passive bliss, have
                    nothing to do with aim, action, or utility, so idleness, _dolce far niente_,
                    comes to be regarded as the best that life can offer, and purpose, which leads
                    to systematic action, is denounced as ridiculous and philistine. The principal
                    utterance to this effect in _Lucinde_ is the following: "_Industry and utility_
                    are the angels of death with the flaming swords, who stand in the way of man's
                    return to Paradise." Yes, that is exactly what they are! Industry and utility
                    bar the way back to all the Paradises which lie behind us. Therefore we hold
                    them sacred! Utility is one of the main forms of good; and what is industry but
                    the renunciation of distracting pleasures, the enthusiasm, the power, whereby
                    this good is attained!</p>
                <p>_Return_ to perfection is, in art, a return to the lawlessness of genius, to the
                    stage at which the artist may do one thing, or may do another which is exactly
                    the opposite. In life it is the retrogression of idleness, for he who is idle
                    goes back, back to passive pleasure. In philosophy it is the return to intuitive
                    beliefs, beliefs to which Schlegel applies the name of religion; which religion
                    in its turn leads back to Catholicism. As far as nature and history are
                    concerned, it is retrogression towards the conditions of the primeval
                    Paradise.[3] Thus it is the central idea of Romanticism
                    itself--retrogression--which explains how it was that even the heaven-storming
                    _Lucinde_, like all the other heaven-stormers of the Romanticists, had not the
                    slightest practical outcome.</p>

                <head>ROMANTIC PURPOSELESSNESS</head>
                <p>In _Lucinde_, then, as in a nutshell, are to be found all the theories which,
                    later in the history of Romanticism, are developed and illustrated by examples.
                    In such an essay as that on the Instinct of Change by the Æsthete in
                    Kierkegaard's _Enten-Eller_ ("Either-Or") idleness is systematised. "Never adopt
                    any calling or profession. By so doing a man becomes simply one of the mob, a
                    tiny bolt in the great machinery of the state; he ceases to be master.... But
                    though we hold aloof from all regular callings, we ought not to be inactive, but
                    to attach great importance to occupation which is identical with idleness....
                    The whole secret lies in the independence, the absence of restraint. We are apt
                    to believe that there is no art in acting unrestrained by any law; in reality
                    the most careful calculation is required, if we are not to go astray, but to
                    obtain enjoyment from it...."</p>
                <p>Idleness, lawlessness, enjoyment! This is the threeleaved clover which grows all
                    over the Romanticist's field. In such a book as Eichendorff's _Das Leben eines
                    Taugenichts_ ("Life of a Ne'er-do-Well") idleness is idealised and exalted in
                    the person of the hero. And purposelessness is another important item, which
                    must on no account be overlooked. It is another designation for the genius of
                    Romanticism. "To have a purpose, to act according to that purpose, artificially
                    to combine purpose with purpose, and thereby create new purposes, is a bad
                    habit, which has become so deeply rooted in the foolish nature of godlike man,
                    that he is obliged, when for once it is his desire to float aimlessly upon the
                    stream of constantly changing images and emotions, to do even this of settled
                    purpose.... It is very certain, my friend, that man is by nature a serious
                    animal." (Julius to Lucinde.)</p>
                <p>On the subject of this utterance, even that orthodox Christian, Kierkegaard,
                    says: "In order not to misjudge Schlegel, we must bear in mind the perverted
                    ideas which had insinuated themselves into men's minds in regard to many of the
                    relations of life, and which had specially and indefatigably striven to make
                    love as tame, well broken-in, heavy, sluggish, useful, and obedient, as any
                    other domestic animal--in short, as unerotic as possible.... There is a very
                    narrow-minded morality, a policy of expediency, a futile teleology, which many
                    men worship as an idol, an idol that claims every infinite aspiration as its
                    legitimate offering. Love is considered nothing in itself; it only acquires
                    importance from the purpose it is made to serve in the paltry play which holds
                    the stage of family life." It is perhaps admissible to conclude that what
                    Kierkegaard says about "the tame, well broken-in, sluggish, and useful domestic
                    animal, love," found its most apt application in Germany, which at that time was
                    undoubtedly the home of the old-fashioned womanliness. The satirical sallies in
                    Tieck's comedies occasionally point in the same direction. In his _Däumling_
                    ("Hop-o'-my-thumb") a husband complains of his wife's craze for knitting, which
                    gives him no peace; a complaint which, perhaps, can only be understood in
                    Germany, where to this day ladies are to be seen knitting even in places of
                    public entertainment--at the concerts on the Brühlsche Terrasse in Dresden, for
                    example. Herr Semmelziege says:--</p>
                <p> "Des Hauses Sorge nahm zu sehr den Sinn ihr ein, Die Sauberkeit, das Porzellan,
                    die Wäsche gar: Wenn ich ihr wohl von meiner ew'gen Liebe sprach, Nahm sie der
                    Bürste vielbehaartes Brett zur Hand, Um meinem Rock die Fäden abzukehren still.
                    * * * * * * * * * * * Doch hätt' ich gern geduldet Alles, ausser Eins: Dass, we
                    sie stand, und we sie ging, auswärts, im Haus, Auch im Concert, wenn Tongewirr
                    die Schöpfung schuf, * * * * * * * * * * * Da zaspelnd, haspelnd, heftig
                    rauschend, nimmer still, Ellnbogen fliegend, schlagend Seiten und Geripp, Sie
                    immerdar den Strickstrumpf eifrig handgehabt."[1]</p>
                <p>The most comical part of this satire is the passage which, whether intentionally
                    or unintentionally on the author's part, reads like a parody of the well-known
                    Roman Elegy in which Goethe drums the hexameter measure, "leise mit fingernder
                    Hand," upon his mistress's back:--</p>
                <p> "Einst als des Thorns heilig Lager uns umfing, Am Himmel glanzvoll prangte Lunas
                    keuscher Schein, Der goldnen Aphrodite Gab' erwünschend mir, Von silberweissen
                    Armen ich umflochten lag. Schon denkend, welch ein Wunderkind so holder Nacht,
                    Welch Vaterlandserretter, kraftgepanzert, soll Dem zarten Leib entspriessen nach
                    der Horen Tanz, Fühl' ich am Rücken hinter mir gar sanften Schlag: Da wähn ich,
                    Liebsgekose neckt die Schulter mir, Und lächle fromm die süsse Braut und sinnig
                    an: Bald naht mir der Enttäuschung grauser Höllenschmerz Das Strickzeug tanzt
                    auf meinem Rücken thätig fort; Ja, stand das Werk just in der Ferse Beugung, wo
                    Der Kundigste, ob vielem Zählen, selber pfuscht."[2]</p>
                <p>When the cult of the useful is carried as far as this, we can understand advocacy
                    of purposelessness.</p>
                <p>But purposelessness and idleness are inseparable. "Only Italians," we are told,
                    "know how to walk, and only Orientals how to lie; and where has the mind
                    developed with more refinement and sweetness than in India? And in every clime
                    it is idleness which distinguishes the noble from the simple, and which is,
                    therefore, the essence of nobility."</p>
                <p>This last assertion is outrageous, but its very audacity is significant. It shows
                    the attitude of Romanticism towards the masses. To have the means to do nothing
                    is, in its estimation, the true patent of nobility. Its heroes are those who
                    cultivate the unremunerative arts, and are supported by others--kings and
                    knights like those in Fouqué's and Ingemann's books, artists and poets like
                    those in Tieck's and Novalis's. It separates itself from humanity, will do
                    nothing for it, but only for the favoured few. The hero and heroine in _Lucinde_
                    are the gifted artist and the woman of genius; it is not the ordinary union, but
                    the "nature-marriage" or the "art-marriage" (_Naturehe, Kunstehe_) for which our
                    interest is claimed. Observe how Julius at once asks Lucinde whether her child,
                    if a girl, shall be trained as a portrait or as a landscape painter. Only as a
                    member of the fraternity of artists do her parents take any interest in her.
                    Only authors and artists have part and lot in the poetry of life.</p>
                <p>It is not difficult to understand how it was that _Lucinde_ was barren of any
                    social results. But though the book had no practical outcome, though it was too
                    feeble to effect any kind of reform, there was, nevertheless, something
                    practical underlying it.</p>
                <p>Let us cast a glance at the principal characters. They stand out in strong relief
                    upon a background of the profoundest scorn for all the prose of real life and
                    all the conventions of society. The book is in no wise ashamed of its erotic
                    theories; in its conscious purity it feels itself elevated above the judgment of
                    the vulgar: "It is not only the kingly eagle which dares to scorn the screaming
                    of the ravens; the swan, too, is proud, and pays as little heed. Its only care
                    is that its white wings shall not lose their brightness; its only desire, to
                    cling, unruffled, to Leda's breast, and breathe forth all that is mortal in it
                    in song."</p>
                <p>The image is pretty and daring, but is it true? The story of Leda and the swan
                    has been treated in so many ways.</p>
                <p>Julius is a pessimistic (_zerrissener_) young man, an artist, of course. We are
                    told in the _Lehrjahre der Männlichkeit_, the chapter containing what Flaubert
                    has called _l'éducation sentimentale_, that it was strikingly characteristic of
                    him that he could play faro with apparently passionate eagerness, and yet in
                    reality be absent-minded and careless; he would dare everything in the heat of
                    the moment, and as soon as he had lost would turn indifferently away. Such a
                    trait may not excite our admiration, but it at all events produces a pretty
                    distinct impression of a pleasure-loving, _blasé_ young man, who, feeling no
                    powerful impulse towards action, seeks for excitement while leading a life of
                    careless, coldly despairing idleness. The history of his development is
                    indicated, as is often the case with quite young men, simply by a succession of
                    female names.</p>
                <p>Of the women in question we have only very slight sketches, like the
                    pencil-drawings in an album. One of these introductory portraits is rather more
                    elaborated than the rest, that of a _dame aux camélias_ sunk in Oriental
                    indolence, who, like the original _dame aux camélias_, is raised above her
                    position by a true passion, and dies when she is neither understood nor
                    believed. She dies by her own hand, makes a brilliant exit from life, and seems
                    to us, as she is described sitting in her boudoir with her hands in her lap,
                    surrounded by great mirrors and inhaling perfumes, like a living image of the
                    æsthetic stupor of self-contemplation and self-absorption, which was the final
                    development of Romanticism. After passing through numbers of erotic experiences,
                    all equally and exceedingly repulsive, Julius finally makes the acquaintance of
                    his feminine counterpart, Lucinde, whose impression is never effaced. "In her he
                    met a youthful artist" (Of course!), "who, like himself, passionately worshipped
                    beauty and loved nature and solitude. In her landscapes one felt a fresh breath
                    of real air. She painted not to gain a living or to perfect herself in an art"
                    (On no account any purpose or utility!) "but simply for pleasure" (Dilettantism
                    and irony!). "Her productions were slight water-colour sketches. She had lacked
                    the patience and industry required to learn oil-painting." (No industry!) ...
                    "Lucinde had a decided leaning towards the romantic" (Of course she had; she is
                    romance incarnate!). "She was one of those who do not live in the ordinary
                    world, but in one created by themselves.... With courageous determination she
                    had broken with all conventions, cast off all bonds, and lived in perfect
                    freedom and independence." From the time when Julius meets her, his art too
                    becomes more fervid and inspired. He paints the nude "in a flood of vitalising
                    light;" his figures "were like animated plants in human shapes."</p>
                <p>With Julius and Lucinde life flows on smoothly and melodiously, "like a beautiful
                    song," in perpetually aroused and satisfied longing. The action passes, as it
                    were, in a studio where the easel stands close to the alcove. Lucinde becomes a
                    mother, and their union is now the "marriage of nature" (_die Naturehe_). "What
                    united us before was love and passion. Now nature has united us more closely."
                    The birth of the child gives the parents "civic rights in the state of nature"
                    (probably Rousseau's), the only civic rights they seem to have valued. The
                    Romanticists were as indifferent to social and political rights as Kierkegaard's
                    hero, who was of opinion that we ought to be glad that there are some who care
                    to rule, thereby freeing the rest of us from the task.</p>
                <p>[1]</p>
                <p> "Her mind was occupied with household cares-- The washing, and the china, and
                    the cook: Did I begin to speak of endless love, She took the bristled
                    clothes-brush in her hand, And calmly turned me round and brushed my coat.</p>
                <p> All this I bore quite placidly, but not That, sitting, standing, everywhere we
                    went, Yes, even at concerts, when sweet strains beguiled,</p>
                <p> Entwining, clicking, rustling, never still, Her elbows flying, thumping on her
                    side, Her knitting-needles vigorously she plied."</p>
                <p>"The sacred hymeneal couch had received us; Luna's chaste beams illumined our
                    chamber. Encircled by white arms I lay, praying for Aphrodite's favour, dreaming
                    of the marvellous child that needs must be the offspring of a night like this,
                    the mighty hero who in fulness of time shall see the light. Soft taps upon my
                    shoulder rouse me from my dream; 'tis my sweet bride caressing me; I thank her
                    silently, with tender, meaning smile. One moment later, and my heart is torn by
                    hellish pangs of disillusionment; it is her knitting that is dancing on my back;
                    worse still--she is at the turning of the heel, that point when the most
                    skilful, despite their counting, often blunder."</p>

                <head>VII</head>
                <p>"LUCINDE" IN REAL LIFE</p>
                <p>Behind this indistinct picture lay a far more definitely outlined reality. The
                    youthful life of the hero corresponded pretty accurately, as Friedrich
                    Schlegel's letters show, with that of the author. In those days Berlin had not
                    yet become pious, but was, according to the evidence of contemporaries, a
                    species of Venusberg, which none approached with impunity. The example of the
                    throne sanctioned every species of moral licence. Enthusiasm for art and
                    literature superseded the official morality which a short time before had been
                    so powerful, but from which men were rapidly emancipating themselves.</p>
                <p>In the autumn of 1799, the year in which _Lucinde_ was published, Friedrich
                    Schlegel wrote to Schleiermacher: "People here have been behaving so
                    outrageously that Schelling has had a fresh attack of his old enthusiasm for
                    irreligion, in which I support him with all my might. He has composed an
                    epicurean confession of faith in the Hans Sachs-Goethe style." This was _Der
                    Widerporst_.</p>
                <p> "Kann es fürwahr nicht länger ertragen, Muss wieder einmal um mich schlagen,
                    Wieder mich rühren mit allen Sinnen, So mir dachten zu entrinnen Von den hohen,
                    überirdischen Lehren, Dazu sie mich wollten mit Gewalt bekehren Darum, so will
                    auch ich bekennen Wie ich in mir es fühle brennen, Wie mir's in allen Adern
                    schwillt, Mein Wort so viel wie anderes gilt, Da ich in bös' und guten Stunden
                    Mich habe gar trefflich befunden, Seit ich gekommen in's Klare, Die Materie sei
                    das einzig Wahre. Halte nichts vom Unsichtbaren, Halt' mich allein am
                    Offenbaren, Was ich kann riechen, schmecken, fühlen, Mit allen Sinnen drinnen
                    wühlen. Mein einzig' Religion ist die, Dass ich liebe ein schönes Knie, Volle
                    Brust und schlanke Hüften, Dazu Blumen mit süssen Düften, Aller Lust volle
                    Nährung, Aller Liebe süsse Gewährung. D'rum, sollt's eine Religion noch geben
                    (Ob ich gleich kann ohne solche leben), Könnte mir vor den andern allen Nur die
                    katholische gefallen, Wie sie war in den alten Zeiten, Da es gab weder Zanken
                    noch Streiten, Waren alle ein Mus und Kuchen, Thäten's nicht in der Ferne
                    suchen, Thäten nicht nach dem Himmel gaffen, Hatten von Gott'nen lebend'gen
                    Affen, Hielten die Erde für's Centrum der Welt, Zum Centrum der Erde Rom
                    bestellt, Darin der Statthalter residirt Und der Welttheile Scepter führt, Und
                    lebten die Laien und die Pfaffen Zusammen wie im Land der Schlaraffen, Dazu sie
                    im hohen Himmelhaus Selber lebten in Saus und Braus, War ein täglich
                    Hochzeithalten Zwischen der Jungfrau und dem Alten."[1]</p>
                <p>Such a poem from such a hand is a genuine proof of the spirit of the times; and
                    it is instructive to observe that when Wilhelm Schlegel (acting upon Goethe's
                    advice) refuses to publish the poem in the _Athenæum_, Novalis, against whom it
                    was especially directed, writes: "I cannot understand why _Der Widerporst_
                    should not be printed. Is it on account of its atheism? Just think of _Die
                    Götter Griechenlands_!"</p>
                <p>The fashions were revolutionary--uncovered bosoms, orientally flowing garments.
                    The tone of the most notable young women of the day was excessively free. No one
                    was more talked of for her beauty at this time than Pauline Wiesel. She was the
                    wife of a highly intellectual man, whose scepticism and satirical, cynical wit
                    made a deep and disturbing impression upon young Tieck (he was the model for
                    Abdallah and William Lovell); and she was one of Prince Louis Ferdinand's many
                    mistresses. The attachment of the dashing young prince, in this case a real
                    passion, still glows in his letters. A contemporary wrote of her: "I look upon
                    her in the light of a phenomenon of Greek mythology." Alexander von Humboldt
                    walked more than thirty miles to see her. It is characteristic of the times that
                    the connection by which Pauline Wiesel compromised herself roused no
                    disapprobation among her more advanced women friends. The irreproachable Rahel,
                    for example, has not a word of blame for it; one might almost imagine that she
                    envied Pauline. As a young girl she writes despondently: "Every means, every
                    possible preparation for living, and yet one must never live; I never shall, and
                    those who dare to do so have the wretched world, the whole world, against
                    them."</p>
                <p>The original of Lucinde, however, was certainly superior to her portrait, a woman
                    of an altogether nobler type. She belonged to Rahel's circle, that group of
                    clever young Jewesses who then represented the noblest, freest intellectual life
                    of Berlin--a circle historically important from the fact that it was the only
                    one in which as yet Goethe's fame was really established and true homage paid
                    him.[2] The lady in question was Moses Mendelssohn's clever, self-reliant
                    daughter, Dorothea, who, to please her parents, had bestowed her hand upon the
                    well-known banker, Veit. It was not by beauty but by her wit and her keen
                    intellectuality that she captivated Friedrich Schlegel. He was at the time
                    twenty-five years of age, she thirty-two. There was nothing sensuous or
                    frivolous in either her appearance or manner; she had large piercing eyes and a
                    masculine severity of expression. In his letters to his brother Wilhelm,
                    Friedrich Schlegel praises "her sterling worth." "She is," he says, "very
                    straightforward, and cares for nothing but love, music, wit, and philosophy." In
                    1789 Dorothea was divorced from her husband and followed Schlegel to Jena. The
                    latter writes at this time: "It has never been our intention to bind ourselves
                    to each other by any marriage contract, though I have long considered it
                    impossible that anything but death should part us. The calculation and
                    adjustment of present and future is antipathetic to me, yet if the detested
                    ceremony were the necessary condition of inseparableness, I should act according
                    to the requirement of the moment and sacrifice my most cherished opinions."</p>
                <p>In the arranging of their relations, none of their intimates helped Friedrich and
                    Dorothea more than their clerical friend, Schleiermacher. On none of Schlegel's
                    friends had _Lucinde_ had such a powerful effect. Schleiermacher was at this
                    time chaplain of the Charité Church in Berlin. He had long followed Friedrich's
                    emancipatory endeavours with warm sympathy, and even admiration. In his essay
                    _On Diotima_, as well as in his harsh criticism of Schiller's _Würde der
                    Frauen_, Friedrich had attacked the traditional conception of woman's position
                    in society. He had held up to contempt the ordinary marriage, in which the
                    wedded pair "live together with a feeling of mutual contempt, he seeing in her
                    only her sex, she in him his social position, and both in their children their
                    own production and property." What he desired was the moral and intellectual
                    emancipation of women. Intellect and culture, combined with enthusiasm, were the
                    qualities which in his eyes made a woman lovable. The ordinary ideal of
                    womanliness he scorned. He writes with bitterness of the stupidity and
                    criminality of the men who demand ignorance and innocence in women, thereby
                    compelling them to be prudish. Prudery is false pretence of innocence. True
                    innocence in woman he maintains to be perfectly compatible with intellectual
                    culture. It exists wherever there is religion, i.e. capacity for enthusiasm. The
                    idea that noble, enlightened free-thought is less becoming in the case of women
                    than of men is only one of the many generally accepted platitudes set in
                    circulation by Rousseau. "The thraldom of woman" is one of the curses of
                    humanity. His highest desire as an author was, as he naively puts it, "to found
                    a system of morality" (eine Moral zu stiften). He calls opposition to positive
                    law and conventional ideas of right, "the first moral impulse" felt by man.</p>
                <p>In his _Vernunftkatechismus für edle Frauen_ ("Catechism of Reason for
                    Noble-minded Women"), a fragment which appeared in the _Athenæum_,
                    Schleiermacher writes in exactly the same strain, calling upon women to free
                    themselves from the bonds of their sex. Nay, incredible as it may sound, it is
                    quite possible (as Haym has proved) that the frequently quoted saying of
                    Friedrich Schlegel, that there is nothing of serious importance to be urged
                    against a _marriage à quatre_, really emanated from Schleiermacher. It is
                    levelled at the many degrading and unreal marriages, at the "unsuccessful
                    attempts at marriage," which the State in its foolishness makes binding, and
                    which prevent the possibility of a true marriage. The writer of the fragment in
                    which the saying occurs observes that most marriages are only preparatory and
                    distant approximations to the true marriage; and Schleiermacher, in his Letters,
                    writes that many attempts are necessary, and that "if four or five couples were
                    taken together, really good marriages might result, provided they were allowed
                    to exchange."</p>
                <p>The underlying reason for the warm personal interest taken by Schleiermacher in
                    Friedrich and Dorothea is, no doubt, to be found in his own position and
                    circumstances at that time. A devoted attachment existed between him and
                    Eleonore Grunow, the childless and most unhappy wife of a Berlin clergyman.</p>
                <p>It seemed to Schleiermacher that the popular indignation roused by _Lucinde_ was
                    largely compounded of philistine and Pharisaical ignorance. The very people who
                    abused it were revelling in Wieland's and Crébillon's immoral tales. "It reminds
                    me," he says, "of the trials for witchcraft, where malice formulated the charge,
                    and pious stupidity carried out the sentence." But what especially led to his
                    ardent championship of the persecuted pair was, he tells us himself, the fact
                    that most of those who complained loudly of offended morality were simply
                    seeking a pretext for a private personal attack on Schlegel.</p>
                <p>An invincible spirit dwelt in Dorothea's frail body. She bore unfalteringly all
                    that her violation of conventional morality brought upon her--private
                    condemnation and public defamation in the shape of innuendoes in the attacks on
                    _Lucinde_. She displayed the most enduring devotion and the most
                    self-sacrificing faithfulness to the man she had chosen. She not only shares his
                    interests and aims, but bears with his unreasonableness and resigns herself
                    uncomplainingly to the caprices of the most capricious of lovers. Nay, more than
                    this, her good sense and cheerfulness scatter all the clouds of despondency that
                    gather round herself and others. Her merry laughter brings relief from
                    Schleiermacher's subtle argumentativeness and Friedrich's transcendental irony.
                    Free in every other respect from feminine sentimentality, she is completely
                    engrossed in admiration of the man she loves, and, with touching modesty,
                    centres all her pride in him. When her novel _Florentin_ is published, a book in
                    which, in spite of its many weaknesses, there is more creative power than in any
                    of Friedrich Schlegel's productions, what makes her happiest and proudest is
                    that his name (as editor) stands on the title-page. She jests merrily on the
                    subject of her literary activity. Blushing and with a beating heart, she sends
                    the first volume of her book to Schleiermacher, and she smiles at the numerous
                    red strokes which adorn the returned manuscript. "There is always the deuce in
                    it where the dative and accusative ought to be." The fact that she too felt
                    impelled to write at the time (about the year 1800) when all the Romanticists,
                    even Schleiermacher and Schelling, were committing literary sins, marks her as
                    one of the German Romantic literary circle; and, moreover, her novel is, in
                    reality, an expression of all the prevailing ideas, an imitation of _Wilhelm
                    Meister_ and _Franz Sternbald_, an exaltation of the harmoniously cultivated few
                    at the expense of the vulgar crowd, a glorification of the free Bohemian life,
                    of idleness and admirable frivolity, of purposelessness in the midst of the
                    prose of reality.</p>
                <p>Dorothea has endowed her hero with characteristics which obviously correspond to
                    Friedrich's as they appeared to her admiring woman's eyes. "In spite of a
                    peculiar and often repellent manner, he has the gift of making himself popular,
                    and wins all hearts without caring whether he does or not. It is of no avail to
                    arm one's self against him with all one's pride; somehow or other he gains
                    entire possession of one. It is often most exasperating not to be able to
                    withstand him, as he himself is not to be won. At times it seems as if he
                    attached another meaning to his words than their obvious one; sometimes when the
                    most flattering things are said to him, he looks utterly indifferent, as if it
                    were a matter of course; at other times, quite unexpectedly, some chance word,
                    let fall without any special intention, affords him the greatest pleasure; he
                    either finds in it or puts into it some peculiar meaning.... But you can imagine
                    how often he gives offence in society."</p>
                <p>Florentin's confessions, too, especially those relating to his wild life as a
                    youth in Venice, remind us of Friedrich's youthful experiences in Leipzig.
                    Although Florentin is an Italian, he feels himself strongly attracted by German
                    art and German artists. He teaches himself to draw and paint, and makes his
                    living, now as the gifted Romantic dilettante artist, now as the no less
                    Romantic musician, roaming from village to village. His birth is wrapt in
                    mystery. He is, as he himself says, "the solitary, the outcast, the child of
                    chance. Something indescribable, which I can only call my destiny, drives me
                    on." He avoids all ties of affection: "Alone will I bear the curse which has
                    been laid upon me."[3]</p>
                <p>It is unnecessary to criticise this characterisation in detail and point out how
                    naïve and excessively Romantic it is. None the less, its writer is in many ways
                    superior to her surroundings. Not for nothing was she the daughter of the sober,
                    sagacious Moses Mendelssohn.</p>
                <p>She would like, she says, to see Friedrich the literary artist, but she would
                    love him better still if she could see in him the worthy citizen of a
                    well-ordered state; it seems to her, indeed, that the character and desires of
                    all her revolutionary friends make literary occupations, reviewing and
                    such-like, as unsuitable for them as a child's cradle for a giant: her ideal is
                    Götz von Berlichingen, who only took up the pen as a rest from the sword.[4]</p>
                <p>Here again we are impressed by what strikes us in reading of Frau von Kalb,
                    namely, that the women of this period display more virile and more concentrated
                    power than the men, and that they persist in treating from the social standpoint
                    questions which the men desire to treat only from the literary. They feel the
                    oppression of existing circumstances more strongly, are less enervated by
                    overmuch book-learning, and look at things more practically than the men.</p>
                <p>The first important event in the life of the young couple was Fichte's coming to
                    live with them. Fichte had been accused of teaching atheism, and his position as
                    a professor was in jeopardy. Caroline Schlegel writes to a friend: "I must
                    answer your questions about the Fichte affair, though it is a very painful one
                    to me and to all admirers of honourable, frank behaviour. You know pretty well
                    yourself what to think of the first accusation, made by a bigoted sovereign and
                    his counsellors, half of them Catholics, the rest Moravian Brethren.... But
                    Fichte is so exasperated by all sorts of reports from Weimar, about things
                    looking bad for him there, &amp;c. &amp;c., that he declares he will resign if
                    they reprimand him, or put any restriction on his teaching.... All who would
                    stand well at court, and the professors whom Fichte has outshone, denounce his
                    boldness and precipitancy. He is abandoned, actually avoided."</p>
                <p>In a letter written jointly by Friedrich, Schleiermacher, and Dorothea, the
                    last-mentioned says: "Things are going well with Fichte here; he is left in
                    peace. Nicolai has intimated that no notice whatever will be taken of him so
                    long as he does not attempt to give public lectures; this would not be well
                    received.... I get on excellently with Fichte, and feel as much at home in this
                    gathering of philosophers as if I had never been accustomed to anything
                    inferior. Though I am still a little timid, this has nothing to do with Fichte
                    personally, but rather with my own position to the world and to Friedrich--I am
                    afraid--yet possibly I am mistaken. I cannot write another word, dear, for my
                    philosophers are pacing up and down the room so incessantly that I am quite
                    giddy."</p>
                <p>Here we have a little domestic scene from Dorothea's life in Berlin. The three
                    were so comfortable together that Fichte was desirous to make the arrangement
                    permanent. He writes to his wife that he is trying to persuade Friedrich to
                    remain in Berlin, and August Wilhelm and his wife to remove there. "If my plan
                    succeeds, the two Schlegels, Schelling, who must also be persuaded to come, and
                    we ourselves will form one family, take a large house, have only one cook,
                    &amp;c., &amp;c."[5] The plan was not carried out. The wives of the two
                    Schlegels did not get on with each other. But is it not like a breath from
                    another world to come, in the midst of all this solicitude for Fichte and
                    indignation at the wrong done him, upon such a passage in one of Dorothea's
                    letters as the following: "I heartily thank your mother for the sweet picture of
                    the saint. I keep it where I can always see it. She is the very saint I should
                    have chosen for myself; she suits me exactly. These pictures and the Catholic
                    music touch me so, that I am determined, if I become a Christian, to be a
                    Catholic."[6] Nowhere is the religious confusion which distinguishes the
                    Romantic School more plainly displayed.</p>
                <p>But Dorothea is not the only female portrait in _Lucinde_. During the course of
                    his development Julius makes the acquaintance of an admirable woman, who is
                    described as follows: "This disease was cured, was expelled, by the very first
                    sight of a woman who was quite unique, and who was the first to exercise
                    complete influence over his mind.... She had made her choice, and had given
                    herself to one who was his friend as well as hers, and who was worthy of her
                    love. Julius was the confidant. He knew exactly what it was that made him
                    unhappy, and sternly judged his own baseness.... He forced all his love back
                    into his inmost heart and let passion rage and burn and consume there. But his
                    outward man was quite changed. So successful was he in counterfeiting the most
                    childlike frankness and innocence, and in assuming a sort of fraternal
                    brusqueness to prevent his melting into tenderness, that she never entertained
                    the slightest suspicion. She was gay and genial in her happiness; suspecting
                    nothing, she shunned nothing, but gave her mood and wit free play when she found
                    him unamiable. All the nobility and all the grace, all the divinity and all the
                    waywardness of the feminine character found in her their most refined, their
                    most womanly expression. Each quality was allowed to develop as freely and
                    vigorously as if it were the only one; and the daring mixture of dissimilar
                    elements did not produce confusion, for a spirit inspired it which was a living
                    breath of harmony and love. In the course of the same hour she would reproduce
                    some comic episode with the refined abandon of the accomplished actress, and
                    read a great poem with simple, touching dignity. At one time it pleased her
                    fancy to shine and trifle in society, at another she was all enthusiasm and
                    ardour, and presently she would be assisting others by word and deed, serious,
                    unassuming, and gentle as a tender mother. Her manner of relating it made any
                    trifling incident as entertaining as a delightful fairy tale. She embellished
                    everything with feeling and wit; she had a power of comprehending everything,
                    and of ennobling everything she touched. Nothing great or good was too holy or
                    too common for her passionate sympathy. She understood the slightest suggestion,
                    and answered even the question that was not asked. It was not possible to make
                    long speeches to her; they turned naturally into interesting conversations,
                    during which an ever-varying music of intelligent glances and sweet expressions
                    played over her delicate features. One seemed to see these glances and
                    expressions while reading her letters, so lucidly and genially did she write, as
                    if talking with her correspondent. Those who only knew this side of her might
                    think that she was merely lovable, that she would make an enchanting actress,
                    that nothing but metre and rhyme were wanting to make her winged words exquisite
                    poetry. But this same woman showed on every occasion that called for it the most
                    astonishing courage and energy; and it was from this side of her character, by
                    her own heroic standard, that she judged men."</p>
                <p>There is more praise than art in this portrait. Sainte-Beuve would have given us
                    a very different delineation. The original of the picture is a woman who, after
                    the publication of her letters under the title Caroline, was known, as if she
                    had been a queen, only by this, her Christian name. It simplified matters, too,
                    to designate her thus, for she had had so many surnames that it was difficult to
                    know by which to call her. She was a daughter of the well-known German
                    philologist, Michaelis; her first husband was a Dr. Böhmer; after his death she
                    married A. W. Schlegel, and her third husband was Schelling. These two last
                    marriages placed her in the centre of the Romantic circle, which seems naturally
                    to group itself round her. She was its own special muse. Grier, the gifted
                    translator of Calderon and Ariosto, says of her that she is by far the cleverest
                    woman he has known. Steffens and Wilhelm von Humboldt use similar expressions.
                    A. W. Schlegel writes of several of his essays, that they are "in part the work
                    of a highly gifted woman, who possessed all the qualifications of a successful
                    author, but whose ambition did not lie in that direction." Schelling writes at
                    the time of her death: "Even had she not been to me what she was, I should mourn
                    the human being, should lament that this intellectual paragon no longer exists,
                    this rare woman, who to masculine strength of soul and the keenest intellect
                    united the tenderest, most womanly, most loving heart. We shall never see her
                    like again." Her portrait is very striking--fascinating, refined, roguish, and
                    yet tender. She is quite in Leonardo's style. Dorothea is far less complex.</p>
                <p>Caroline was born in 1763, and was twenty-one at the time of her first marriage.
                    A. W. Schlegel made her acquaintance whilst he was a student at Göttingen, and
                    fell in love with her, but she refused to marry him. Intercourse between them
                    was broken off for a time, but was carried on by correspondence while Schlegel
                    was at Amsterdam, where he went as a tutor in 1791. Here various amorous
                    episodes, amongst them one serious love affair, threw Caroline for a time into
                    the shade. Meanwhile, she was entangling herself in a net of the strangest
                    relations. In 1799 she had gone to Mainz, where she lived in the house of Georg
                    Forster, Humboldt's teacher, a man equally distinguished as a scientist and an
                    author. When this gifted and admirable, but far too sanguine man, embarked on
                    revolutionary enterprises and attempted to extend French republicanism to the
                    Rhine districts, Caroline enthusiastically aided and abetted him. She was in
                    communication with the members of the Republican Club in Mainz, and she was
                    unjustly suspected of communicating with the enemy through her brother-in-law,
                    G. Böhmer, who was Custine's secretary. When Mainz was reconquered by the German
                    troops, she was arrested, and spent several months in barbarous imprisonment,
                    sharing a room with seven other people. From prison she wrote to A. W. Schlegel
                    for assistance.</p>
                <p>Her position was even worse than it appeared to be. In Mainz, in desperation at
                    the disappointment of her dearest hopes (she had expected that the manly,
                    energetic Tatter would offer her his hand), she had thrown herself into the arms
                    of her adorer for the moment, a Frenchman, and the results of this connection
                    would inevitably compromise her for ever, if she were not freed from prison in
                    time. Schlegel's influence and her own brother's unremitting endeavours procured
                    her release. With quiet chivalry August Wilhelm placed Caroline, now forsaken by
                    all her other friends, under the protection of his younger brother, Friedrich.
                    It was in these singularly unpropitious circumstances that Friedrich made her
                    acquaintance. He was by no means prepossessed in her favour, in fact, was
                    inclined to look upon her with contempt; yet this is how he writes: "I had
                    certainly not expected simplicity and a positively divine truthfulness.... She
                    made a profound impression upon me. I longed to be in a position to win her
                    confidence and friendship; but the moment she showed some return of the feeling
                    I saw very clearly that the bare attempt would lead to the most painful
                    struggles, and that if a friendship between us were possible at all, it could
                    only be the fruit of much that was unjustifiable.... Thenceforward every selfish
                    desire was abandoned. The relation in which I stood to her was perfectly
                    innocent and simple. In my behaviour there was the reverence of a son, the
                    candour of a brother, the frankness of a child, and the unobtrusiveness of a
                    stranger."[7]</p>
                <p>In 1796 A. W. Schlegel married his somewhat deeply compromised friend. Her circle
                    soon included all the leading men of the day. She was in constant intercourse
                    with Goethe, Herder, Fichte, Schelling, Hegel, Tieck, Schleiermacher, and
                    Hardenberg. This was the time of Goethe's intimate connection with the young
                    school. It was in the process of formation, and its members held their first
                    meetings at Jena. Caroline breakfasts with Goethe, dines with Fichte, and is
                    soon only too inseparable from Schelling.</p>
                <p>The following extract from one of her letters to Schelling (March 1, 1801)
                    affords an example of the vigour and the subtlety of this remarkable woman's
                    criticism: "You surely do not expect me, dearest friend, to enlighten you as to
                    the compass of Fichte's mind, though you almost express yourself as if you did.
                    It has always seemed to me as if, in spite of his incomparable reasoning powers,
                    the soundness of his deductions, his lucidity and accuracy, his direct intuition
                    of the Ego, and his discoverer's enthusiasm--as if in spite of all this he were
                    limited. My explanation of the matter is, that the divine spark is lacking in
                    him; and if you have broken through a circle from which he has not been able to
                    escape, I believe that you have done it not so much as the philosopher--don't
                    scold me if I am using the word wrongly--but rather because there is poetry in
                    you and none in him. Poetical inspiration led you directly to productiveness;
                    keenness of apprehension led him to knowledge. He has light, the clearest and
                    brightest, but you have warmth as well; and light can only illuminate, while
                    warmth produces. Now, have I not seen all this cleverly?--just as one sees a
                    boundless landscape through a keyhole."</p>
                <p>In another letter we find an amusing reference to Hegel, which shows us that
                    philosopher in a novel light: "Hegel is playing the beau and general gallant"
                    (Hegel macht den Galanten und allgemeinen Cicisbeo).[8]</p>
                <p>Caroline shares enthusiastically in all the efforts of the Romantic School; she
                    revises, reviews anonymously, writes herself, influences other writers directly
                    and indirectly. She is obliged to expend that politico-revolutionary ardour, of
                    which she possesses a far larger share than the men, on literary skirmishes and
                    intrigues. We find her, for instance, writing an anonymous and tolerably sharp
                    review of Schlegel's _Ion_; Schlegel replies, also anonymously, criticising her
                    criticism; then Caroline calls Schelling to her assistance, and he, acting as
                    her champion, falls upon Schlegel still more heavily in a third anonymous
                    article, written in an extremely polished manner--at the same time writing
                    privately to him that he hopes he will not take it amiss. It is to Caroline that
                    the misunderstanding and final rupture between Schiller and Schlegel is due; she
                    sets the brothers against the poet by her extremely witty but unfair mockery of
                    his style; Schiller, on his side, cannot be acquitted of having treated them
                    with considerable haughtiness at the beginning of their literary career. His
                    name for Caroline is "Dame Lucifer."</p>
                <p>Caroline's worst side was displayed in her small-minded hatred of poor Dorothea
                    Veit, whom she positively persecuted. This hatred disturbed the beautiful
                    relation between August Wilhelm and Friedrich, who were intimate friends as well
                    as brothers. At one time it threatened to separate them altogether. Observe the
                    way in which she speaks of Dorothea: "Friedrich was present at the performance
                    of _Alarkos_, and immediately afterwards got into a post-chaise and set off for
                    France, where it is his intention to be married in republican fashion. Under
                    Robespierre, drowning in the Loire went by the name of _noces republicaines_;
                    such a wedding for one half of the couple I should not object to."</p>
                <p>Her best qualities were called forth by her daughter, that remarkable child,
                    Auguste Böhmer, whose name, although she died at the age of fifteen, has a place
                    in the history of German literature. All who read this child's criticism of
                    Friedrich or of Dorothea, or her rhymed letters to Tieck and Schleiermacher, are
                    astounded by her precociousness. Her death was a turning-point in Caroline's
                    life. Schelling, who very possibly had been first attracted by the daughter,
                    drew nearer to the mother in her sudden and sad bereavement. He was then quite
                    young, labouring ardently at his earliest works, glowing with passion, sparkling
                    with genius, the favourite of Goethe. Caroline and he had a great common sorrow
                    and need of consolation. Their feeling for each other soon assumed the character
                    of passionate love. The publication by the unscrupulous opponents of the
                    Romanticists of a pamphlet in which it was asserted that Schelling, with his
                    crazy _Naturphilosophie_ and the treatment he had recommended, had shortened the
                    child's life, only drew them closer together. The charge was a pure fabrication.
                    It was in his reply to this pamphlet that Schelling made use of the violent
                    language quoted in the introduction to Lassalle's _Capital and Labour_.
                    Caroline's relations with Schlegel had long been of the coldest; he and she
                    lived in different towns. Had she been of a jealous disposition, she would have
                    found abundant cause for complaint. After his separation from Caroline, Schlegel
                    formed a connection with Tieck's sister, Sophie Bernhardi, who divorced her
                    husband for his sake. His last attempt at marriage, with the daughter of Paulus,
                    the rationalist, was not a success, and ended in a divorce.</p>
                <p>When Schelling and Caroline had become so indispensable to each other that it was
                    necessary to break the tie which bound her to Schlegel, the latter, with perfect
                    chivalry, gave his consent. Writing of the divorce, Caroline says: "We broke a
                    tie which neither of us had ever considered permanently binding."[9] Her new
                    marriage was a perfectly happy one.</p>
                <p>The way in which Schlegel takes Caroline's decision enlightens us not only as to
                    the theories of the Romanticists, but as to the manner in which the leaders of
                    the school applied them in their own lives. August Wilhelm not only gives his
                    consent, but continues to keep up a friendly correspondence with Schelling, and
                    in literary matters the two men render each other valuable assistance. Caroline
                    herself maintains the friendliest relations with Schlegel long after he is aware
                    of the relation in which she stands to Schelling. She writes to him in May 1801:
                    "Will you, please, decide a dispute between Schelling and me? Are these
                    hexameters (Schelling's) worth anything? I consider the last lines awkward, but
                    he maintains that they are good." Schlegel actually visited the couple at
                    Munich, in company with Madame de Staël.</p>
                <p>Thus even very serious personal disagreements and ruptures could not divide those
                    whom fellowship of ideas and a common endeavour to promote them, united. The
                    Romanticists considered personal liberty an inalienable right, and respected it
                    in others while demanding it for themselves.</p>
                <p>But we learn something else besides the fact that the Romanticists were very
                    changeable in their loves, and perfectly regardless of social ties; and that
                    something is, that their women were superior to them in everything but talent,
                    and that what the men did was to drag them down to their own level. We see the
                    strong-minded, energetic Dorothea, who is so keenly sensible of the pettiness of
                    the purely literary endeavours of the Romanticists, slowly change, see her
                    reluctantly admire _Lucinde_, then write novels herself in the prescribed style,
                    and finally follow Friedrich to Vienna and become a Catholic along with him. Or
                    look at the high-spirited, enthusiastic, resolute Caroline, who, as a young
                    widow not much over twenty, attempts to revolutionise the Rhineland. So
                    unflinching is she then, that she compromises herself recklessly, and risks the
                    life and well-being of those dearest to her with absolute regardlessness.
                    Friedrich writes to August Wilhelm: "I shall never forgive her heartlessness in
                    being ready to beguile you, her friend, into that vortex of ignoble dangers and
                    worthless characters." Only a few years later we see this same woman writing
                    anonymous reviews, favourable or unfavourable, of her husband's wretched dramas,
                    and entirely absorbed in literary intrigues. Ever and anon her spirit is
                    momentarily stirred by a breath wafted from the old times. Then we feel how
                    changed she is. Writing to her daughter in October 1799, after giving her a
                    quantity of family news, the last item of which is: "Hofrath Hufeland has
                    returned, with wife and children," she exclaims: "But what sorry trash is all
                    this! _Buonaparte is in Paris!_ Think of that, child! All will go well again.
                    The Russians have been driven out of Switzerland; they and the English will be
                    obliged to capitulate with disgrace in Holland; the French are making way in
                    Swabia; and now comes Buonaparte. Rejoice with me, or I shall think that you are
                    entirely taken up with frivolities and have no serious thoughts at all." Then,
                    almost in the same breath, literary gossip: "Tieck is here and we are much
                    together. You would never believe all that these men take it into their heads to
                    do. I will send you a sonnet on Merkel. He has been running about Berlin,
                    telling that the Schlegels have received a reprimand from the Duke on account of
                    the _Athenæum_, &amp;c. So Wilhelm and Tieck set to work the other evening and
                    wrote a wicked sonnet in his honour. It was splendid to see the two pairs of
                    brown eyes flashing at each other, and the wild merriment with which the
                    perfectly justifiable squib was concocted. Dorothea and I almost rolled on the
                    floor with laughter. She knows how to laugh, which will recommend her to you.
                    Merkel is done for; he will never recover it. There will be a terrible
                    uproar.... Schelling is attacking the _Allgemeine Litteraturzeitung_ with all
                    his might. _These quarrels, however, are of no importance to you; but Buonaparte
                    and the Russians most certainly are_." It is as though she strove to keep the
                    larger interests alive in her daughter, feeling that they were dying in herself.
                    Soon she marries Schelling, and conforms to all the established conventions of
                    that great clerical stronghold, Bavaria.</p>
                <p>Many great men have vainly attempted to teach the women they loved to share their
                    interests. To my mind no worse accusation can be brought against gifted men, no
                    surer sign of their weakness adduced than this, that, far from raising the women
                    who have given themselves to them and followed them, they have dragged them
                    down, taken from them their highest interests and noblest sympathies, and given
                    them small and mean ones in exchange. From such a charge the Romanticists cannot
                    free themselves. They treated the great women given them by the gods as they did
                    the great ideas which were their own heritage; they took from them the noble,
                    liberal-minded social and political enthusiasm by which they were naturally
                    characterised, and made them, first Romantic and literary, then remorseful, and
                    finally Catholic.</p>
                <p>[1] Plitt: _Aus Schelling's Leben_, i. 282. "I can bear it no longer; I must live
                    once more, must let my senses have free play--these senses of which I have
                    well-nigh been robbed by the grand transcendental theories to which they have
                    done their utmost to convert me. But I too will now confess how my heart leaps
                    and the hot blood rushes through my veins; my word is as good as any man's; and
                    of good cheer have I been, in fair weather and in foul, since I became persuaded
                    that there is nothing real but matter. I care not for the invisible; I keep to
                    the tangible, to what I can taste and smell, and feel, and satisfy all my senses
                    with. I have no religion but this, that I love a well-shaped knee, a fair, plump
                    bosom, a slender waist, flowers with the sweetest odours, full satisfaction of
                    all desires, the granting of all sweet love can ask. If I am obliged to have a
                    religion (though I can live most happily without it), then it must be the
                    Catholic, such as it was in the olden days, when there was no scolding and
                    quarrelling, when all were kneaded of one dough. They did not trouble about the
                    far-off, did not look longingly up to heaven; they had a living image of God.
                    The earth they held to be the centre of the universe, and the centre of the
                    earth was Rome. There the great vicegerent sat enthroned, and wielded the
                    sceptre of the world; and priests and laity lived together as they live in the
                    land of Cocagne; and in the house of God itself high revelry was held."</p>

                <p>SCHLEIERMACHER'S LETTERS</p>
                <p>The Romanticists themselves were by no means satisfied with _Lucinde_. Novalis
                    has most to say in its favour. He is of opinion that there are few such personal
                    books; it seems to him that in it all the workings of the author's mind may be
                    observed as distinctly as the play of chemical forces during the dissolution of
                    a lump of sugar in a glass of water. He is somewhat disturbed by the species of
                    delusion prevailing throughout the work, which makes man, the thinking being, a
                    mere natural force, and which takes such possession of the reader that he finds
                    himself deeply interested in what is simply sensual instinct. Moreover, the
                    whole is not simple enough, not sufficiently free from pedantry. Yet "Romantic
                    chords" are not lacking, and it is not so much the matter as the form to which
                    he objects.</p>
                <p>He writes at once to Caroline Schlegel: "There is nothing to object to in the
                    ideas, but in the manner of expressing them there is a good deal which strikes
                    me as being borrowed from Krates [the cynic]. The cry, 'Be cynical!' is not yet
                    heard among us, and even really advanced women will blame the beautiful Athenian
                    for having made the market-place her bridal chamber."</p>
                <p>Quite true; only it was not the luckless Dorothea who was to blame for the
                    profanation, even though she did not feel incensed by the public exhibition, as
                    we do on her behalf; her lord and master was alone to blame.</p>
                <p>We have seen that Caroline soon allowed her satirical wit free play in writing of
                    _Lucinde_; and A. W. Schlegel, Schelling, Steffens, and the others privately
                    regarded it as an _enfant terrible_, whatever their public utterances may have
                    been. A. W. Schlegel indeed wrote, in a sonnet to Friedrich:--</p>
                <p> "Dich führt zur Dichtung Andacht brünst'ger Liebe, Du willst zum Tempel dir das
                    Leben bilden, Wo Götterrecht die Freiheit lös' und binde. Und dass ohn' Opfer
                    der Altar nicht bliebe, Entführtest Du den himmlischen Gefilden, Die hohe Gluth
                    der leuchtenden Lucinde."[1]</p>
                <p>And when Kotzebue published the comedy, _Der hyperboräische Esel_, which
                    satirises Friedrich and his book, August Wilhelm responded with the witty
                    satire, _Ehrenpforte für den Präsidenten von Kotzebue_; but privately he called
                    the book a "foolish rhapsody." Tieck called it "eine wunderliche Chimäre," and
                    even Schleiermacher attempted to disavow his authorship of the _Letters on the
                    Subject of Lucinde_, after his inclination to a species of sensual mysticism had
                    given place to a Protestant-rationalistic tendency. Nevertheless, or rather, for
                    this very reason, it is of importance that we should inquire into the nature of
                    these letters, which were written with the aim of proving _Lucinde_ to be, not
                    merely an innocent, but a good and holy book, the worth of which is testified to
                    by the delight which high-minded women take in it. On the letters of two such
                    women, his sister, Ernestine, and his friend, Eleonore Grunow, Schleiermacher's
                    own are based.</p>
                <p>There is little of general interest for us nowadays in these letters, so we shall
                    only notice their salient points. As _Lucinde_ is the solitary contribution of
                    Romanticism towards the solution of a social problem, and as marriage is almost
                    the only social question grappled with by literature generally at the beginning
                    of the century (Goethe's _Wanderjahre_ alone, in the manner of Rousseau's
                    romances, occupying itself with a wider range of such questions), it will be of
                    interest to compare the utterances of the different European literatures on this
                    subject.</p>
                <p>Schleiermacher's book is an attack upon prudery. At the very beginning he writes:
                    "I was almost inclined to believe that you had become a prude; if you had, I
                    should have entreated you to go and settle in England, to which country I should
                    like to banish the whole genus." And one division of the book is entirely
                    devoted to an analysis of that false modesty which precludes true modesty, and
                    causes so much unnecessary misery.</p>
                <p>"The anxious and narrow-minded modesty by which society at the present day is
                    characterised, has its root in the consciousness of a great and general
                    wrongheadedness and depravity. But where is it to end? It is bound to spread
                    farther and farther. If people are perpetually on the lookout for what is
                    immodest, they will end by discovering it in every domain of thought, and all
                    conversation and social intercourse must cease.... utter depravation and the
                    perfect education by which man returns to innocence, both do away with modesty;
                    in the first case true modesty, as well as false, is destroyed; in the second,
                    it ceases to be a thing to which much attention is paid or much importance
                    attached.[2]</p>
                <p>"Is it not the case, dear child, that everything spiritual in man has its
                    beginning in an instinctive, vague, inward impulse, which only the action of the
                    individual, frequently repeated, develops into definite, conscious will and a
                    perfected faculty. Not until they have developed so far can there be any
                    question of a lasting connection between these inward impulses and definite
                    objects. Why should love be different from everything else? Is it reasonable to
                    expect the highest faculty of man to be perfect from the first? Should it be
                    easier to love than to eat and drink? Surely in love too there must be
                    preparatory attempts, from which nothing permanent results, but which all tend
                    to make the feeling more distinct and more noble. The connection of these
                    attempts with any definite object is merely accidental, at first often purely
                    imaginary, and always ephemeral--as ephemeral as the feeling itself, which soon
                    gives place to one more clearly defined and intense. Inquire of the most mature
                    and highly cultivated men and women; you will find that they smile at the
                    thought of their first love as at any other laughable childish performance, and
                    often live in complete indifference side by side with the object of it.
                    According to the nature of things it must be so, and to insist upon faithfulness
                    and a lasting connection is as dangerous as it is foolish."</p>
                <p>Schleiermacher naturally warns his correspondent against what he calls the
                    chimera of the holiness of first love: "Do not believe that everything depends
                    upon something coming of it. The novels which support this idea, and make love
                    between the same two beings develop uninterruptedly from its first raw beginning
                    to its highest perfection, are as hurtful as they are silly; and their authors,
                    as a rule, have as little understanding of love as they have of art.... When the
                    more or less indefinite love longing settles upon a definite object, there
                    necessarily arises a definite connection, and a point of closest approach. When
                    this point has been reached and you feel that it is not the right one, not one
                    that can be held, what is there left for you to do but to part again? Only after
                    such an attempt has been completed as an attempt, that is to say, after the
                    connection has been broken off, can the memory of it and reflection upon it
                    produce a truer understanding of the longing and feeling, and thus prepare for
                    another and better attempt. Is there any obligation to make the next with the
                    same person? Upon what can such an obligation be founded? _I, for my part,
                    consider this more unnatural than love between brother and sister_. Allow
                    yourself perfect liberty, then; endeavouring only to preserve a pure-minded,
                    clear feeling that it is merely an experiment, so that you may be prevented from
                    sanctioning and perpetuating that which is not intended to be more, by that
                    self-surrender which, from its nature, ought to mark the end of experiments and
                    the beginning of a true and lasting love. Such a mistake, which is both the
                    consequence and the cause of the most miserable delusions, you must regard as
                    the most terrible thing that can happen to you; I would have you understand that
                    this is in reality allowing one's self to be seduced. When you have found true
                    love, and feel yourself to have reached the point at which you can perfect your
                    character and make your life beautiful and worthy, diffidence and fear of the
                    last and most precious seal of union will seem to you pure affectation. The only
                    danger lies in the fact that every attempt, from its very nature, aims at
                    reaching this point. The point of sufficiency can only be discovered by satiety.
                    But if you are healthy in mind and heart, you will, as often as one of these
                    attempts to love approaches this point, feel an aversion which is something far
                    higher and holier than any law, or than what generally goes by the name of
                    modesty and chastity."</p>
                <p>[Illustration: SCHLEIERMACHER]</p>
                <p>Sound and sensible reflections, one and all, but neither exhaustive nor
                    applicable to what are the real difficulties of the case. Schleiermacher warns
                    against mistakes, but cannot remedy them, without infringing upon the sanctity
                    of marriage, which he never calls in question. For what is to be done when the
                    mistake has already been made? And what when it has been on one side only, when
                    only the love of the one has grown cold, while that of the other still endures?
                    And he does not give a word or a thought to the fact that marriage, as a social
                    institution, does not exist for the sake of the lovers, that its original
                    intention was to secure the father's property for the children, and that it has
                    continued to exist because it seemed to society the only means of protecting the
                    rising generation. Schleiermacher, the idealist, would fain discover a new moral
                    foundation, and entirely overlooks the real, the practical difficulties. How
                    characteristic of the nation to which the author belongs is all this pondering
                    over feeling! An Italian once said to me: "What astonishes us most in the
                    emotional life of the Teutonic nations is their conception and cult of love.
                    With them love is positively a religion, something in which a good man is bound
                    to believe. And this religion has its theology, and its philosophy, and what
                    not. We simply love, and no more about it." I thought of this speech when
                    reading Schleiermacher. How much ingenuity he exhibits in proving that men
                    should not allow themselves to be disturbed by false theories when they love,
                    and what a steadfast belief in the love which is to "complete and perfect the
                    character," lies at the foundation of it all! It is instructive to compare with
                    Schleiermacher's some utterances by great authors of other nations on the same
                    subject; they throw what is peculiarly national in his into more marked
                    relief.</p>
                <p>George Sand, whose first novels are the expression of the same movement in France
                    which _Lucinde_ inaugurates in Germany, says, by the mouth of the principal
                    characters in _Jacques_ and _Lucrezia Floriani_: "Paul and Virginia were able to
                    love each other steadily and undisturbedly; for they were children brought up by
                    the same mother. Our surroundings have been too utterly unlike.... If two beings
                    are to understand each other always, and to be united by an unchangeable love,
                    their characters as children must have been formed by a similar education, they
                    must have the same beliefs, the same turn of mind, even the same manners and
                    habits. But we, the distressed offspring of a turbulent and corrupt society,
                    which behaves to her disunited children like a stepmother, and is more cruel in
                    her periods of savagery than actual savages are, how can we wonder, after such
                    great outward divisions, at the perpetual divisions of hearts and the
                    impossibility of inward harmony."</p>
                <p>Obviously George Sand is considerably less persuaded than Schleiermacher of the
                    probability or possibility of the individual's meeting with that "right one,"
                    love for whom perfects. Jacques says: "I am still persuaded that marriage is one
                    of the most barbarous institutions of society. I doubt not that it will be
                    abolished when the human race makes further progress towards justice and reason;
                    a more human and not less sacred tie will take its place and will ensure the
                    well-being of the children without fettering the freedom of the parents. But as
                    yet men are too barbarous and women too cowardly to demand a nobler law than the
                    iron one by which they are now ruled. Beings destitute of conscience and virtue
                    need heavy chains. The improvements of which some generous spirits dream, cannot
                    be realised in such an age as ours; these spirits forget that they are a hundred
                    years in advance of their contemporaries, and that before they change the law,
                    they must change mankind." Jacques says to his bride on their wedding day:
                    "Society is about to dictate an oath to you. You are about to swear to be
                    faithful and obedient to me, that is to say, never to love any one but me, and
                    to obey me in all things. One of these vows is an absurdity, the other a
                    disgrace."</p>
                <p>The idea expressed by George Sand in all these books is, that to preserve the
                    outward semblance of love, by caresses, &amp;c., after it has ceased to exist,
                    is what constitutes real immorality in love. Jacques says: "I have never forced
                    my imagination to rekindle or reanimate a feeling in my soul which I no longer
                    found there. I have never looked upon love as a duty, constancy as a rôle. When
                    I have felt that love was extinguished in my soul I have said so, without being
                    either ashamed or conscience-stricken." And _Lucrezia Floriani_ says, still more
                    emphatically: "Not one of all the passions to which I have yielded naively and
                    blindly, seemed to me so guilty as the one which I was endeavouring, contrary to
                    my feeling, to make lasting."</p>
                <p>The French authoress looks upon unchangeable love for one and the same person as
                    a possibility only, dependent upon certain conditions; and her idea of love is
                    not, like Schleiermacher's, that it is the highest educational force, but that,
                    as an irresistible natural force, a possessing passion, it is beautiful, the
                    most beautiful thing in life. Institutions must adapt themselves to it, since it
                    cannot change its nature to suit institutions. A disciple of Rousseau, she
                    champions the cause of nature.</p>
                <p>Let us now glance at one of the works of a contemporary English writer of the
                    same tendencies, at Shelley's _Queen Mab_. In the notes he has appended to this
                    poem we come upon a third variation of the opposition to prevailing opinions.
                    Shelley says: "Love is inevitably consequent upon the perception of loveliness.
                    Love withers under constraint: its very essence is liberty: it is compatible
                    neither with obedience, jealousy, nor fear: it is there most pure, perfect, and
                    unlimited, where its votaries live in confidence, equality, and unreserve.... A
                    husband and wife ought to continue so long united as they love each other: any
                    law which should bind them to cohabitation for one moment after the decay of
                    their affection would be a most intolerable tyranny, and the most unworthy of
                    toleration. How odious an usurpation of the right of private judgment should
                    that law be considered which should make the ties of friendship indissoluble, in
                    spite of the caprices, the inconstancy, the fallibility, and capacity for
                    improvement of the human mind. And by so much would the fetters of love be
                    heavier and more unendurable than those of friendship, as love is more vehement
                    and capricious, more dependent on those delicate peculiarities of imagination,
                    and less capable of reduction to the ostensible merits of the object.... Love is
                    free: to promise for ever to love the same woman is not less absurd than to
                    promise to believe the same creed.... The present system of constraint does no
                    more, in the majority of instances, than make hypocrites or open enemies.
                    Persons of delicacy and virtue, unhappily united to one whom they find it
                    impossible to love, spend the loveliest season of their life in unproductive
                    efforts to appear otherwise than they are, for the sake of the feelings of their
                    partner or the welfare of their mutual offspring: those of less generosity and
                    refinement openly avow their disappointment, and linger out the remnant of that
                    union, which only death can dissolve, in a state of incurable bickering and
                    hostility. The early education of their children takes its colour from the
                    squabbles of the parents; they are nursed in a systematic school of ill-humour,
                    violence, and falsehood.... The conviction that wedlock is indissoluble holds
                    out the strongest of all temptations to the perverse: they indulge without
                    restraint in acrimony, and all the little tyrannies of domestic life, when they
                    know that their victim is without appeal.... Prostitution is the legitimate
                    offspring of marriage and its accompanying errors. Women, for no other crime
                    than having followed the dictates of a natural appetite, are driven with fury
                    from the comforts and sympathies of society. It is less venial than murder....
                    Has a woman obeyed the instincts of unerring nature (_sic_!), society declares
                    war against her, pitiless and eternal war: she must be the tame slave, she must
                    make no reprisals; theirs is the right of persecution, hers the duty of
                    endurance. She lives a life of infamy: the loud and bitter laugh of scorn scares
                    her from all return. She dies of long and lingering disease: yet _she_ is in
                    fault, she is the criminal, and society the pure and virtuous matron, who casts
                    her as an abortion from her undefiled bosom!... Young men, excluded by the
                    fanatical idea of chastity from the society of modest and accomplished women,
                    associate with these vicious and miserable beings.... Chastity is a monkish and
                    evangelical superstition, a greater foe to natural temperance even than
                    unintellectual sensuality; it strikes at the root of all domestic happiness, and
                    consigns more than half of the human race to misery, that some few may
                    monopolise according to law. A system could not well have been devised more
                    studiously hostile to human happiness than marriage. I conceive that from the
                    abolition of marriage the fit and natural arrangement of sexual intercourse
                    would result. I by no means assert that the intercourse would be promiscuous: on
                    the contrary, it appears, from the relation of parent to child, that this union
                    is generally of long duration, and marked above all others with generosity and
                    self-devotion.... In fact, religion and morality, as they now stand, compose a
                    practical code of misery and servitude: the genius of human happiness must tear
                    every leaf from the accursed book of God ere man can read the inscription on his
                    heart. How would morality, dressed up in stiff stays and finery, start from her
                    own disgusting image, should she look in the mirror of nature!"</p>
                <p>Here again we have appeals to nature; but the standpoint is an entirely different
                    one. Shelley, the enthusiastic atheist, attributes the principal miseries of
                    social humanity to traditional religion. "Unerring" nature is the divinity he
                    substitutes for the God of the Bible. He considers that man has the right to
                    demand happiness, and, like a true Englishman, contends, without troubling much
                    about the psychology of the matter, for the freedom of the individual from the
                    compulsion of external law. Schleiermacher warns against what is _foolish_,
                    because, once the foolish step is taken, it is binding; but he, the Protestant
                    pastor, only indirectly incites to revolt. George Sand rebels against what is
                    _dishonourable_. In the ethical creed of the French authoress honour plays the
                    same part that wisdom does in Schleiermacher's; it is by the mouth of Jacques,
                    her ideal of manly honour, that she protests in the name of the honour of
                    humanity. Shelley stands forth as the champion of personal liberty; it is
                    _thraldom_ that he desires to abolish. The English apostle of liberty, soon to
                    be an exile, unhesitatingly attacks the institutions of society. George Sand
                    never directly attacked marriage. She actually says in the introduction to
                    _Mauprat_: "It is husbands I have attacked, and if I am asked what I propose to
                    substitute for them, I answer --marriage." But Shelley, who takes cognisance of
                    all evils from the social and political standpoint, proposes to improve humanity
                    by legislation, being persuaded that the state is bound to secure as much
                    liberty of action as possible to the individual as citizen.</p>
                <p>It is obvious that, of these three representatives of the same idea,
                    Schleiermacher is the most profound thinker and the most reserved. In his
                    estimation character is of the first importance, in George Sand's, the heart,
                    and in Shelley's, happiness. These three great writers are the spokesmen of
                    three great nations, and by comparing them we are better able to understand the
                    character of the whole movement which begins at the beginning of the century,
                    but which can neither settle into shape nor produce good and tranquillising
                    results until the intellectual and social emancipation of woman has advanced so
                    far that she is independent of social prejudices, knows her own needs, and is in
                    a position to supply them.</p>
                <p>[1] It is the sacred ardour of love that makes of thee a poet; thou aimest at
                    transforming life into a temple, where divine right binds and looses. And that

                <p>WACKENRODER: ROMANTICISM AND MUSIC</p>
                <p>In his _Letters on Lucinde_, Schleiermacher, the high-minded and honourable,
                    brought all his intelligence to bear upon the task of finding something
                    complete, something sensible, in the book. He read his personal opinions into
                    it. But his position was a false one. He was trying, by means of the discussion
                    of an unreal book, to settle a real question, trying to base a freer, higher
                    moral code upon a work which, instead of doing what it professed to do, namely,
                    proving the possibility of transforming life into poetry, simply retailed the
                    fantastic performances of a few talented individuals, interspersing reflections
                    on the poetry in a wild, extravagant reality.</p>
                <p>_Lucinde_ was hollow at the core. And this hollow, empty idealism is a feature
                    common to all the many ramifications of Romanticism. Goethe's Prometheus cries
                    to Zeus: "Didst thou imagine that I would loathe life, that I would flee into
                    the wilderness, because all my dream-blossoms did not mature?" Thus speaks a
                    Prometheus, thus a Goethe. But it was only natural that this emotional, inactive
                    young generation should produce a group of authors who, just because "all their
                    dream-blossoms did not mature," in desperate dissatisfaction with reality
                    grasped at empty air and pursued shadows, which they obstinately persisted in
                    trying to endow with corporeal existence, maintaining that art and poetry and
                    their element and organ, imagination, are alone essential and living, but that
                    all else (in other words, real life) is, as vulgar prose, meaningless, nay evil,
                    in the eyes of genius.[1]</p>
                <p>And yet the earliest preachers of this new doctrine were far from being wild or
                    defiant. The first countenance which meets our gaze is, on the contrary,
                    peculiarly gentle, one of the purest and mildest in all modern literature--the
                    pale, noble face of Wackenroder.</p>
                <p>The Romantic enthusiasm for art first found expression in a delicate little work
                    from the pen of an ardent youth, whose life was shortened by the conflict
                    between his burning desire to live for art, and the obligation laid upon him by
                    his father to pursue a practical calling. He died, his powers entirely
                    exhausted, in his twenty-fifth year. His life was like the mild, gentle breeze,
                    which on a day in the early spring warms the air, and tempts forth the first
                    flowers. His letters to Tieck, who was his intimate friend, and for whom he had
                    an unbounded admiration, reveal an almost girlish affection for that more virile
                    and notable man.</p>
                <p>In every library of any importance one is sure to find a small, beautifully
                    printed and bound book, published in 1797, entitled _Herzensergiessungen eines
                    kunstliebenden Klosterbruders_ ("Heart Outpourings of an Art-Loving Friar"). The
                    author's name is not given. As vignette there is a head of Raphael, who, with
                    the great eyes, full lips, and slender neck given him in this portrait, looks
                    like some highly intellectual Christian devotee of Venus, far advanced in
                    consumption. The inscription below the picture is not simply Raphael, but "the
                    divine Raphael," i.e. the Raphael of the Romanticists. This dainty little book
                    is, as it were, the primary cell of the whole Romantic structure; round it the
                    later productions group themselves. Though not the offspring of a vigorous
                    creative power, its germinative force proved wonderfully great. It is a book
                    which contains nothing but ivy-like, twining ideas, nothing but passive
                    impressions; but the wax upon which these impressions are stamped is so pure
                    that the impressions are firm and clear. The title does not mislead; the author
                    pours out his heart in a stream of fervent and religious enthusiasm for art,
                    giving expression to a few simple ideas in a simple, untheoretical manner. The
                    book is not the product of a great or epoch-making mind; but it has one great
                    virtue, it is original. To the Friar the only allowable attitude towards art is
                    that of devotion; great artists are in his eyes blessed, holy saints. His
                    admiration for them is that of an adoring child.</p>
                <p>More than once in the course of the book Tieck has collaborated with Wackenroder;
                    but the simple autobiography of the young musician, Joseph Berglinger, is
                    entirely Wackenroder's work. The delicate refinement of Berglinger's character
                    reminds us of Joseph Delorme, the fictitious personage in whom the young,
                    Romantic, Sainte-Beuve described himself. Berglinger is Wackenroder. Like
                    Wackenroder he opposes the determination of his father that he is not to become
                    an artist, and simultaneously carries on an even harder struggle with himself in
                    the matter of his position towards art. What troubles him is a fear, which
                    curiously enough meets young Romanticism here on the very threshold, like the
                    shadow of its fate, the fear of being incapacitated for real life by too entire
                    absorption in art. Rückert has given masterly expression to the idea in the
                    following lines:--</p>
                <p> "Die Kinder, lieber Sohn, der Gaukelschwertverschlucker In Madras üben sich
                    nicht an Confekt und Zucker, Von Bambus lernen sie die Spitzen zu verschlingen,
                    Um wachsend in der Kunst es his zum Schwert zu bringen. Willst Du als Mann das
                    Schwert der Wissenschaft verdaun, Musst Du als Jüngling nicht
                    Kunstzuckerbrödchen kaun."[2]</p>
                <p>Joseph expresses it thus: Art is a tempting, forbidden fruit; he who has once
                    tasted its sweet, innermost juice is irrevocably lost to the acting, living
                    world. The soul which art has enervated is perplexed and helpless face to face
                    with reality. Joseph himself is only delivered from this distressing mental
                    condition when glorious music raises him high above the troubles of this earth.
                    But he is at the mercy of his moods, and fittingly likens his soul to the
                    "Æolian harp, whose strings vibrate to a breath that comes one knows not whence,
                    and on which the changing breezes play at will." Music was the art Wackenroder
                    loved and understood best; in his posthumous _Fancies on the Subject of Art_ he
                    places it above all the others.</p>
                <p>Wackenroder resembled Novalis in constitution, but had even less capacity for
                    resistance to the storms of life. He was good-natured and credulous to a degree,
                    with a genuine Romantic credulity, which saw mysteries and miracles everywhere.
                    This inclination of his led to practical jokes being played upon him by his
                    comrades--though they too were all more or less liable to hallucinations and
                    disposed to put faith in miracles. An account of one such trick has been
                    preserved, such an anecdote as only the biography of a Romanticist could supply.
                    Indeed, to understand the theories of the Romanticists, it is necessary to see
                    the men themselves in their everyday life and at their desks.--Wackenroder was a
                    diligent student, and never willingly missed a lecture. Two of his less
                    conscientious friends went to his room during the hour of a certain lecture,
                    knowing that he would be absent, and tied a dog, in a sitting posture, to the
                    chair in front of the writing-table. Both paws were carefully placed on a huge
                    folio which lay open on the table. The clever animal, accustomed to such
                    performances, sat quietly in this ludicrous position while the two friends hid
                    in an adjoining room to watch the development of their plot. Returning earlier
                    than usual to fetch some papers he had forgotten, Wackenroder stood motionless
                    with astonishment, gazing at the dog and its learned occupation. Fearful of
                    neglecting his duty, and unwilling to put an end to the marvellous apparition,
                    he gently lifted his papers from the table and left the room. In the evening, no
                    one else seeming inclined to talk, he suddenly broke the silence by saying
                    impressively: "Friends, I must tell you a most marvellous thing. Our
                    Stallmeister (the dog) can read."[3] Does not this read like a scene from
                    Tieck's _Puss in Boots_ or Hoffmann's story of the dog Berganza? Do not these
                    books, grotesquely unreal as they are, seem actual transcripts from the private
                    lives of the Romanticists? In _Kater Murr_, the cat says: "Nothing in my
                    master's room attracted me more than the writing-table, which was strewn with
                    books, manuscripts, and all manner of remarkable instruments. I might call this
                    table the magic circle into which I was irresistibly drawn, all the time feeling
                    a kind of holy awe, which prevented me from at once yielding to my inclination.
                    At last, one day, when my master was absent, I overcame my fear and sprang upon
                    the table. What joy to sit in the midst of the papers and books and rummage
                    about amongst them!" Then the cat dexterously opens a large book with its paws
                    and endeavours to comprehend the printed signs. At the very moment, however,
                    when it seems to feel a wonderful spirit taking possession of it, it is
                    surprised by its master who, with the cry: "Confounded animal!" rushes at it
                    with uplifted stick. But he immediately starts back, exclaiming: "Cat! cat! you
                    are reading! Nay, that I may not and will not forbid. What a marvellous desire
                    for knowledge you have been born with!"</p>
                <p>Such a scene cannot strike us as unnatural in a purely fanciful tale, when we
                    have learned what could happen in real life. We seem to see the rainbow of
                    fantastic imagination stretching its arch over the whole Romantic movement, from
                    its first mild, though earnest, herald to its last weird, mannered exponent,
                    from Wackenroder to Hoffmann. When, in the Life of Tieck, we find innumerable
                    records of similar hallucinations, we begin to suspect that there is nothing,
                    however fantastic, to be found in the Romanticists' writings which their fevered
                    vision did not persuade them that they saw in real life.</p>
                <p>It is exceedingly interesting to observe, not only the influence which
                    Wackenroder's moods and emotions exercise upon Tieck, but also the part which
                    the latter, thus influenced, takes in Wackenroder's work. The first thing which
                    strikes one is, that Tieck, hitherto able only during the emancipating moments
                    of production to rouse himself out of dark, William Lovell-like moods and give
                    his rich talent free play, learns from Wackenroder to believe in imagination and
                    art as mighty powers in human life, thereby arriving at the only firm basis for
                    a philosophy of life to which he ever attained. The second is, that he, the less
                    independent spirit of the two, following in Wackenroder's footsteps, accentuates
                    all his tendencies, carrying them to wildly fantastic, yet natural
                    conclusions.</p>
                <p>It is in those portions of the _Herzensergiessungen_ in which Tieck collaborated,
                    that the Roman Catholic tendency appears undisguisedly. It was Tieck who made
                    the painter Antonio worship, not art alone, but also "the Blessed Virgin and the
                    Holy Apostles"; and Tieck's is the dictum, that true love of art must be a
                    "religious love or a beloved religion." But most remarkable of all as a
                    biographical document is a letter, which, though repudiated by Tieck, was
                    certainly written by him, the letter in which a young man, a disciple of Albert
                    Dürer, who has come to Rome to study art, describes his conversion to
                    Catholicism. It takes place in St. Peter's. "The sonorous Latin chants, which,
                    rising and falling, penetrated the swelling waves of music like ships making
                    their way through the waves of the sea, raised my soul higher and ever higher.
                    When the music had pervaded my entire being and was flowing through all my
                    veins, I roused myself from inward contemplation and looked around me, and the
                    whole temple seemed to me to be alive, so intoxicated was I with the music. At
                    this moment it ceased; a priest advanced to the high-altar, and with impressive
                    gesture lifted high the Host in view of the assembled multitude. All sank upon
                    their knees, and trumpets and I know not what mighty instruments crashed and
                    boomed the spirit of adoration into my very soul. Then all at once it seemed to
                    me as though that whole kneeling multitude were praying for the salvation of my
                    soul, and I mingled my prayer with theirs."</p>
                <p>This passage is of peculiar importance because it contains a conclusive proof
                    (one overlooked by that most thorough of observers and critics, Hettner) that
                    the tendency to Catholicism had its root in the very first principle of the
                    Romantic movement. Both Hettner and Julian Schmidt attach too much importance to
                    the fact that Schlegel, as an old man, in his well-known letter to a French
                    lady, ascribes this Catholic tendency simply to a _prédilection d'artiste_. For
                    the reason, the origin, of the artistic predilection is to be found in the
                    original revulsion from the rational.</p>
                <p>But the tendency in the direction of Catholicism was not the only one of
                    Wackenroder's tendencies which was immediately seized upon and exaggerated by
                    Tieck and his school. In the _Fantasien über die Kunst_ Wackenroder praises
                    music as the art of arts, the art which above all others is capable of
                    condensing and preserving the emotions of the human heart, of teaching us "to
                    feel feeling." What else, what more, did the Romanticists feel? This exactly
                    suited Tieck. Wackenroder proclaims the superiority of music over poetry, and
                    affirms that the language of music is the richer of the two. To whom could this
                    appeal as much as to the man whose poems are rather an expression of the moods
                    in which poetry is written than poetry itself, rather moods of art than works of
                    art?</p>
                <p>Tieck goes further than Wackenroder, and from music selects instrumental music as
                    that in which alone art is really free, emancipated from all the restraints of
                    the outer world. Hoffman too, musician as well as poet, calls instrumental music
                    the most romantic of all the arts; and it may be mentioned as a striking
                    instance of the coherence which invariably exists between the great intellectual
                    phenomena of an age, as a proof of the fact that the Romanticists, with all
                    their supposed and all their real independence and spontaneity, were
                    unconsciously yielding to and following an inevitable general tendency, that it
                    is just at this time that Beethoven emancipates instrumental music, and raises
                    it to its highest development.</p>
                <p>Enthusiasm for musical intensity and fervour having thus found its way into
                    literature, Tieck soon arrives at the point of regarding emotional, melodious
                    sound as the only true, the only pure poetry. His _Love Story of Fair Magelone_
                    is a good example of this. Even in the prose portions of the tale everything
                    rings and resounds--the hero's emotions and the landscape which serves as a
                    background for them. The Count hears none of the sounds around him; for "the
                    music within him drowned the rustling of the trees and the splashing of the
                    fountains." But this inward music in its turn is drowned by the sweet strains of
                    real instruments. "The music flowed like a murmuring brook, and he saw the charm
                    of the Princess come floating upon the silver stream, saw its waves kiss the hem
                    of her garment.... Music was now the only movement, the only life in nature."
                    Then the music dies away. "Like a stream of blue light" it disappears into the
                    void; and forthwith the knight himself begins to sing.</p>
                <p>In the "Garden of Poesy," of which we read in _Zerbino_, roses and tulips, birds
                    and the azure of the skies, fountains and storms, streams and spirits, all sing.
                    We read in _Bluebeard_ that "the flowers kissed each other melodiously." In this
                    literature everything has its music--the moonlight, scents, painting; and then
                    on the other hand we read of the beams, the fragrance, and the shapes of music:
                    "They sang with melodious throats, keeping time with the music of the
                    moonbeams." The Romanticists had turned their backs upon material reality.
                    Definite, corporeal form, nay, even a distinct representation of mental
                    conditions was impossible to them. This was not what they aimed at. In their
                    eyes tangibility was coarse and vulgar. Every distinct feature melts away in a
                    sort of dissolving view. They are afraid of losing in profundity and infinity
                    what they might possibly gain in restraint and plastic power.</p>
                <p>All the masters of the school agree on this point. First and foremost we have
                    Novalis. His _Hymns to Night_, and indeed all his lyrics, are night and twilight
                    poetry, in the dusk of which no distinct outlines are possible. His
                    psychological aim was, as he himself says, to fathom the nameless, unconscious
                    powers of the soul. Therefore his æsthetic theory is, that language ought to
                    become musical, to become song again; and he also maintains that in a poetical
                    work there need be no unity except that of spirit, that unity of idea or action
                    is unnecessary. "One can imagine," he says, "tales without more coherence than
                    the different stages of a dream, poems which are melodious and full of beautiful
                    words, but destitute of meaning or connection; at most, comprehensible stanzas
                    here and there, like fragments of perfectly unrelated things. This true poetry
                    can of course only have a general allegorical significance and an indirect
                    effect, like music."</p>
                <p>How entirely this harmonises with the theories of Friedrich Schlegel! Schlegel,
                    whose nature was a series of moods, who had not strength of will to carry out
                    any plan, whose own career resembles an arabesque beginning with a thyrsus and
                    ending with a cross composed of a knife and fork, says: "The arabesque, the
                    simple musical swaying of the line itself, is the oldest, the original form in
                    which human imagination takes shape. Its contours are no more definite than
                    those of the clouds in the evening sky."</p>
                <p>The saying is apt when applied, not to imagination in general, but to the
                    imagination of the Romanticists. Tieck's lyrics resemble Goethe's as the clouds
                    on the horizon resemble snow-clad mountains. Our attitude to the lyric poetry of
                    the Romanticists resembles that of Polonius to the cloud: "Do you see yonder
                    cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?--By the mass, and 'tis like a camel,
                    indeed.--Methinks it is like a weasel.--It is backed like a weasel.--Or like a
                    whale?--Very like a whale." In Novalis, in the poems at any rate, we have still
                    tangible, distinct artistic form, in Tieck's writings everything floats in a
                    sort of mist or vapour of form supposed to correspond to the mysterious,
                    expectant fervour of the theme. The work of art is stayed and fixed in its
                    first, embryonic, vapour-ball stage. This elementary product of the imagination
                    is designated primitive poetry. In order to reduce clearly defined poetic art
                    once more to primeval poetry, all definite forms must be dissolved and kneaded
                    together. Tieck preferred those works of the great poets which they wrote before
                    their style was developed, or which they chose to leave tolerably formless (he
                    confesses that not one of Shakespeare's plays produced such an impression on him
                    as _Pericles_, only part of which is genuine), and he himself, following in the
                    track of _Pericles_, produced such works as _Genoveva_ and _Octavian_, in which
                    the epic, lyric, and dramatic styles are all minced up together.</p>
                <p>This medley of styles was adopted in Denmark. It was well suited to the subject
                    of Oehlenschläger's _St. Hans Aßen Spil_ and fairly so to that of his _Aladdin_;
                    sometimes it produced very unsuccessful results, as in the case of Hauch's
                    _Hamadryaden_.</p>
                <p>So great is Tieck's formlessness, so impossible is it to him (in his Romantic
                    period) to condense, that he is inefficient even in pure lyric poetry. He may
                    talk much of music and of the music of words, but he is wanting in the gift of
                    rhythm; he does not seem to have had a correct ear. A. W. Schlegel was
                    infinitely Tieck's superior in this respect, as is proved by his admirable
                    translations of the songs in _As You Like It_. But of Tieck and most of the
                    Romanticists it is true that, in spite of all their talk of melodious style,
                    they themselves were only melodious when they reverted to those southern
                    measures, to the exact rules of which they were obliged to conform. They filled
                    in the framework of sonnet and canzonet as ladies fill in with embroidery an
                    outline designed upon canvas, crowding in rhymes in such superabundance that the
                    meaning was often swamped by them. Tieck writes in _Magelone_:--</p>
                <p> "Errungen, Bezwungen Von Lieb ist das Glück, Verschwunden Die Stunden, Sie
                    fliehen zurück; Und selige Lust Sie stillet, Erfüllet Die trunkene,
                    wonneklopfende Brust."</p>
                <p>In Baggesen's _Faust_ we find the following rather overdone parody of this
                    Romantic jingle:--</p>
                <p> "Mit Ahnsinn Wahnsinn, lächelndweinend, Einend-- Mit Schiefe, Tiefe,
                    dunkelmeinend, Scheinend-- Der Enge Läng' entflammt in weiten Breiten, Muss
                    licht der Dichter durch die Zeiten gleiten."</p>
                <p>And it was not only metres that the Romanticists borrowed from the Spaniards and
                    Italians, but all kinds of technical tricks. They naively set to work to produce
                    a lyrical picture with the assistance of assonances and tragic vowel sounds.
                    Every vowel and consonant in the alphabet was pressed into the service in turn.
                    Forty sonorous as in succession are supposed to induce a cheerful frame of mind
                    in the reader, and a score or so of sombre, mournful us make his flesh creep.
                    Take as an example Tieck's melancholy U-Romance of old Sir Wulf, who is carried
                    off by the devil. In it he goes the length of using _begunnte_ instead of
                    _begann_ for the sake of tragic effect. When the reader's nerves have been
                    narcotised for half-an-hour by such terminations as
                    Unke--Sturme--hinunter--begunnte--verdunkeln --verschlungen--Wulfen--Münze
                    gulden--grossen Kluften-rucke, Drucke--thuen, Zünften--lugen--bedunken--tiefen
                    Brünsten--vielen Unken, die heulten und wunken--zu dem Requiem des todten
                    Wulfen, den der dunkle Satan mit vielen Wunden--erschlüge--when nothing but
                    u-tu-tu is sounding in his ears, he has reached the climax, language has become
                    music, and he floats off on the stream of an emotional mood. It is in drama that
                    this vowel-music is most comical. In Friedrich Schlegel's _Alarkos_, that
                    arsenal of assonances and alliterations, the hero sometimes for two or three
                    pages in succession ends every line with the same vowel:--</p>
                <p> "Ihr Männer all', Pilaster dieser alten Burg, Genossen, Tapfre! die umkränzt
                    mein Ritterthum, Dess Glorie wir oft neu gefärbt mit hoher Lust In unsres kühnen
                    Herzens eignem heissen Blut-- Die alte Ehr' in tiefer Brust, der lichte Ruhm,
                    Dem festen Aug' in Nacht der einzig helle Punkt, So folgten Einem Stern wir all'
                    vereint im Bund; Der Bund ist nun zerschlagen durch den herben Fluch, Der mich
                    im Strudel fortreisst fremd' und eigner Schuld.-- Mich zwingt, von hier zu
                    eilen, ein geheimer Ruf, Nach fernen Orten muss ich in drei Tagen, muss Ein
                    gross Geschäft vollenden, und die Frist ist kurz."</p>
                <p>And on it goes--Burg, Lust, Muth, Schutz, Kund, Brust, Furcht, und, Ruhms, thun,
                    Bund, uns, &amp;c., &amp;c. One derives quite as much satisfaction from the
                    assonances alone as from the complete lines. When _Alarkos_ was performed in
                    Weimar and the audience burst into uproarious laughter, Goethe rose from his
                    place in the stalls, cried in a voice of thunder: "Man lache nicht!" and
                    signalled to the police that all who continued to laugh were to be turned out.
                    We who read _Alarkos_ now, are thankful that no one has the right to turn us
                    out.</p>
                <p>The reason why the Romanticists subjected themselves to all this metrical
                    restraint is not far to seek. These compulsory, cold metres exactly suit writers
                    in whom metrical skill is combined with a complete lack of inventive power. But
                    _terza rima, ottava rima_, and sonnets are an insufficient disguise for the
                    formlessness of their matter. When the mist is so thick that it can be cut with
                    a knife, the Romanticists cut it into fourteen pieces and call it a sonnet.</p>
                <p>In the unrestricted metres, formlessness and prosiness reach a climax. What, for
                    instance, can be said for such lines as the following, from Tieck's _Römische
                    Reise_?--</p>
                <p> "Weit hinter uns liegt Rom, Auch mein Freund ist ernst, Der mit mir nach
                    Deutschland kehrt, Der mit allen Lebens Kräften Sich in alte und neue Kunst
                    gesenkt, Der edle Rumohr, Dess Freundschaft ich in mancher kranken Stunde Trost
                    und Erheiterung danke."[4]</p>
                <p>That well-known drastic critic of the Romanticists, Arnold Ruge, supplied an
                    appendix to this, which runs:--</p>
                <p> "Hochgeehrter Herr Hofrath! Dieser unmittelbaren Lyrik, Das verzeihn Sie
                    gütigst, weiss ich Mit dem besten Willen, Sowohl in alter als in neuer Poesie,
                    Nichts zur Seite zu stellen, Als etwa diesen Schwachen Versuch einer freien
                    Nachbildung."[5]</p>
                <p>But the attempt to make away with language in favour of music reaches a climax
                    when Tieck goes so far as to endow music itself, or musical instruments, with
                    the power of speech. Occasionally the result is comical, as in _Sternbald_
                    (first edition), where the instruments all talk, the flute saying:--</p>
                <p> "Unser Geist ist himmelblau, Führt Dich in die blaue Ferne. Zarte Klänge locken
                    Dich, Ein Gemisch von andern Tönen. Lieblich sprechen wir hinein, Wenn die
                    ändern munter singen, Deuten blaue Berge, Wolken, Lieben Himmel sänftlich an,
                    Wie der letzte leise Grund Hinter grünen frischen Baümen."[6]</p>
                <p>This train of thought received its most classic expression in the poem with which
                    _Phantasus_ ends, the theme of which is, in the manner of Calderon, repeated
                    with innumerable variations:--</p>
                <p> "Liebe denkt in süssen Tönen, Denn Gedanken stehn zu fern, Nur in Tönen mag sie
                    gern Alles, was sie will, verschönen.</p>
                <p> Drum ist ewig uns zugegen, Wenn Musik mit Klängen spricht, Ihr die sprache nicht
                    gebricht, Holde Lieb' auf allen Wegen; Liebe kann sich nicht bewegen, Leihet sie
                    den Odem nicht."[7]</p>
                <p>This superhuman love, which differs from ordinary human love in being unable to
                    employ language as an organ, finds absolutely appropriate expression in music;
                    language is only employed to condemn itself and to declare that it cedes its
                    place to music. To such a degree of subtlety and ultrarefinement does the
                    Romantic spirit gradually lead.</p>
                <p>The next step is that which Tieck takes in his comedy, _Die verkehrte Welt_ ("The
                    Topsy-Turvy World"), namely, the employing of language exclusively on account of
                    its musical qualities. To this comedy there is prefixed as overture a symphony,
                    which, in its essentially musical vagueness, displays really classic
                    originality. Music had never been paraphrased into words in this manner before;
                    hence the experiment is to this day regarded as distinctly typical. The man who
                    has the courage to carry his madness to its final consequence, by doing so
                    endows this madness, in which there is method, with living vigour.</p>

                    as that we really do it. From gravity we turn to gaiety; then, weary of gaiety,
                    return to gravity; but let us observe ourselves too closely, in either case have
                    our aim too constantly in view, and there's an end as well to real seriousness
                    as to unaffected gaiety."</p>

                <p>"But are reflections such as these appropriate in a symphony? Why begin so
                    sedately? No! no indeed! I will rather at once set all the instruments to play

                    It is difficult to read at sight, how much more difficult, then, to hear at

                    rolls, like thunder among the mountains. There is a rush and a roar as when a
                    cataract, despairingly seeking its own destruction, flings itself over the naked
                    ledge and rages down, deeper and ever deeper down, into the bottomless

                <p>One sees that Kierkegaard, in his well-known essay on _Don Juan_ (in the

                    Commandant--"Hör, hör, hör Mozart's Don Juan!"), is merely going a little
                    farther in the direction indicated by Tieck; and it is very evident how close
                    the relation is between Tieck's first conception of the romantic ideal and
                    Hoffmann's transformations of music into the emotional outbursts and weird
                    visions of _Kreisleriana_.</p>
                <p>But Hoffmann, who possessed such great and original musical gifts that he can
                    hardly be considered an author pure and simple, but must be treated as a
                    poet-musician, was far more in earnest than Tieck in this matter of making music
                    in words. He lived and moved and had his being in music; he was as fertile a
                    composer as he was an author, and many of his writings are fantasies on the
                    subject of music or of the great composers. When ill he was wont, in his
                    feverish wanderings, to confuse his attendants with musical instruments. Of one
                    who had a soft, languishing voice, he said: "I have been tormented to-day by the
                    flute." Of another, with a deep bass voice: "That insufferable bassoon has been
                    plaguing me the whole afternoon."</p>
                <p>When he introduces Gluck into his _Fantasiestücke_, he makes him speak of the
                    intervals as if they were living beings. "Once again it was night. Two giants in
                    shining cuirasses rushed upon me--the Keynote and the Fifth! They seized me, but
                    their eyes beamed mildly on me: 'I know what fills thy breast with longing; that
                    gentle, winning youth, the Third, will soon appear among the giants.'" Kreisler
                    too is made to talk of stabbing himself with a gigantic Fifth. What in the other
                    Romanticists is fantastic sentimentality, in Hoffmann becomes weird
                    burlesque.</p>
                <p>In the sketch entitled _Kreisler's musikalisch poetischer Klub_, he gives to the
                    characteristic qualities of certain notes the names of colours, and thereby
                    produces a picture of a connected series of mental impressions. He had the keen
                    perception peculiar to certain delicately organised, nervous temperaments, of
                    the relationship which undoubtedly exists between sounds and colours.</p>
                <p>As an example of Hoffmann's advance on Tieck's attempts to express pure music in
                    words, note the passage which describes how, after Kreisler has played, a
                    marvellous rush of magnificent chords and runs is heard within the pianoforte
                    itself. There is a genuinely Romantic blending of the impressions of the
                    different senses in the attempt made to give some idea of this music: "Its
                    fragrance shimmered in flaming, mysteriously interwoven circles." On this
                    follows a representation, in emotional language, of the various keys and chords,
                    a thing hitherto unattempted.</p>
                <p>_Chord of A Flat Minor_ (_mezzo forte_).</p>
                <p>"Ah!--they bear me away to the land of eternal longing; but as they lay hold of
                    me, anguish awakes and rends my breast."</p>
                <p>_E Major Sixth_ (_ancora piu forte_).</p>
                <p>"Stand steadfast, my heart! Break not, struck by the scorching ray that has
                    pierced my breast. Be of good courage, my soul! Mount high into the element
                    which gave thee birth and is thy home!"</p>
                <p>_E Major Third_ (_forte_).</p>
                <p>"They have crowned me with a glorious crown, but the sparkles and flashes of its
                    diamonds are the thousand tears I have shed, and in its gold gleam the flames
                    that have consumed me. Courage and power, confidence and strength befit him who
                    is called to reign in the spiritual realm."</p>
                <p>_A Minor_ (_harpeggiando dolce_).</p>
                <p>"Why wouldst thou flee, lovely maiden? Thou canst not, for thou art held fast by
                    invisible bands. Nor canst thou tell what it is that has taken up its abode in
                    thy breast. 'Tis like a gnawing pain, yet it makes thee tremble with joy. But
                    thou wilt know all when I talk to thee fondly in that spirit language which I
                    can speak and thou canst understand...."</p>
                <p>_E Flat Major_ (_forte_).</p>
                <p>"Follow him! follow him! His raiment is green like the green of the forest; the
                    sweet tones of the horn echo in his wistful words! List to the rustling in the
                    bushes, list to the horn blasts, full of rapture and pain! It is he! Let us
                    hasten to meet him!"</p>
                <p>Then finally we have the parody of all this in _Kater Murr_, where Hoffmann
                    reproduces caterwauling in verse, a glossary of the different sounds being
                    provided.</p>
                <p>It is in this entirely musical poetry that Wackenroder's idea of art attains to
                    its truest and highest expression. The vigorous pantheism which in Goethe's case
                    is plastic, and finds expression in the creation of the _Diana der Epheser_,
                    here becomes musical. In all Tieck's early works, with their piety, their
                    sensuality, their reminiscences of Wackenroder and of Goethe, we feel the rush
                    of a strong, broad wave of Romantic pantheism. In _Sternbald_, for example, he
                    writes: "We often listen intently and peer into the future, in eager expectation
                    of the new phenomena that will soon pass before us in motley, magic garb. At
                    such times we feel as if the mountain stream were trying to sing its melody more
                    clearly, as if the tongues of the trees were loosened, that their rustling might
                    be to us intelligible song. Soon the flute-like notes of love are heard in the
                    distance; our hearts beat high at his coming; time stands still as if arrested
                    by a magic word; the shining moments dare not flee. We are enclosed, as it were,
                    in a magic circle of melody, and rays of a new, transfigured existence penetrate
                    like mysterious moonlight into our actual life." And again: "O impotent Art! how
                    stammering and childish are thine accents compared with the full swelling organ
                    tones that well forth from the inmost depths, from mountain and valley, forest
                    and stream! I hear, I feel how the eternal World Spirit sweeps all the strings
                    of the terrible harp with constraining fingers, how all the most diverse forms
                    are born of his playing and speed throughout nature upon spirit wings. My little
                    human heart in wild enthusiasm takes up the contest and fights itself weary and
                    faint in its rivalry with the highest.... The eternal melody, jubilant and
                    exultant, storms past me."</p>
                <p>Both life and poetry are here resolved into music.</p>
                <p>In all ages, and in every domain of art, the artist has at times been tempted to
                    display his mastery over his material by defying it while using it. In the
                    history of sculpture came a period when, irritated by the heaviness of stone,
                    sculptors endeavoured to compel it to express lightness and airiness; or else,
                    like the mannerists of the rococo period, imitated the art of the painter. In
                    like manner the Romanticists would fain have language regarded only as a thing
                    akin to music; their endeavour is to use words more for their sound than their
                    meaning. They tried to make word-music, much as the prose authors of our own day
                    try, with more or less success, to make word-pictures. It is not difficult to
                    see what led to this particular crotchet. Their antipathy to purpose, their
                    devotion to irony, naturally induced the desire not to be bound by, not to be
                    responsible for, their words. They use them ironically, in such a manner that
                    they can retract them. They will not have them standing solidly before them,
                    indicating an aim, a purpose. Just as, by conceiving of liberty as licence, they
                    succeeded in returning to a point where it was possible for them to do this, or
                    to do that, as the fancy took them, so they succeeded, by conceiving of language
                    simply as sound, in making it the vehicle of emotion without tendency, that is,
                    without relation to life and action. They did not really escape tendency; that
                    is an impossibility; but, as theirs was not the tendency upwards and onwards,
                    they gravitated downwards and backwards. And, since they were perpetually
                    compelling words to declare themselves incompetent and to abdicate in favour of
                    music, it was only natural that the musical composers also, influenced by the
                    spirit of the times, should endeavour to express the Romantic ideal in their
                    art, with those means to which the poets in their impotence had constantly
                    attempted to recur.</p>
                <p>Tieck's dramatised fairy-tales, of which _Bluebeard_ may be taken as a specimen,
                    have a great resemblance to opera libretti. The fantastic, legend-like
                    productions of the Romanticists are, indeed, precisely the sort of thing
                    demanded by opera. There would have been a future for Tieck as a writer of opera
                    libretti. As a matter of fact, he only wrote one, and that one was never set to
                    music. The theories of Romanticism nevertheless found due expression in music.
                    E. T. A. Hoffmann represents the transition from Romantic authorship to Romantic
                    musical composition. As an operatic composer, he is not only the musical
                    interpreter of Calderon, the poet of past days most admired by the Romanticists,
                    but also collaborates fraternally with contemporary Romanticists. He writes
                    music for Brentano's _Die lustige Musikanten_ and Zacharias Werner's _Das Kreuz
                    an der Ostsee_, and bases an excellent three-act opera on Fouqué's _Undine_.</p>
                <p>As an operatic writer he is, however, less the musical genius than the gifted
                    translator of poetry into the language of music. In the opinion of the most
                    competent judges, he was only thoroughly successful with subjects which
                    harmonised with his own literary leaning to the terrible and the supernatural.
                    We have him at his best, for instance, in the songs of the wild, inhuman Teutons
                    in _Das Kreuz an der Ostsee_, with their expression of untamable passions, and
                    in the fairy tale-like, supernatural scenes of _Undine_, which produce a feeling
                    of agreeable eeriness.</p>
                <p>No less an authority than Karl Maria von Weber bestowed hearty praise upon the
                    last-mentioned opera. And Weber himself is, beyond comparison, the greatest of
                    the composers who succeeded in giving expression in music to the Romantic theory
                    of art. In his choice of themes he follows closely in the track of the
                    Romanticists. In _Preciosa_ the joys of a free, vagabond life are extolled, just
                    as they are in Tieck's _Franz Sternbald_ and Eichendorff's _Leben eines
                    Taugenichts_ ("Life of a Ne'er-Do-Well"). In _Oberon_ we are transported into
                    the fairy world of Shakespeare's _Midsummer Night's Dream_, the play which
                    served as the point of departure for all Tieck's fantastic comedies. And in _Der
                    Freischütz_, Weber, like the Romanticists in their later periods, has recourse
                    to the popular in his art, makes use of national, popular melodies, just as the
                    Romanticists of Germany and Denmark made use of national, popular songs, and,
                    like them, introduces popular traditions and superstitions. No one witnessing a
                    performance of _Der Freischütz_ in a German theatre could be for a moment in
                    doubt, even though he were deaf, of its being a Romantic opera. He sees the
                    gloomy ravine where the spirits of nature dwell, the weird moonlight dance
                    (scenes that remind one of the temptations of St. Anthony in old Dutch
                    paintings), and, finally, the wild chase in which, with a marvellously illusive
                    effect, shadows projected by a species of magic lantern pursue each other
                    through the air. But to the listening connoisseur the real interest lies in the
                    attitude of the composer to all these external conditions. He feels that Weber
                    treats his subject much as the Romanticists do theirs, only with greater genius.
                    He too drives his art to one of its extremes. Just as the Romanticists are
                    inclined to conceive of speech as only sound and rhythm, he is inclined to treat
                    music as if it were simply rhythm. Samiel's _Motiv_, for example, is more
                    rhythmic than melodic, and consequently produces a coarser, more realistic, but
                    also more picturesque effect. The Romanticists write musical poetry; Weber
                    composes pictorial music. While Beethoven presents us with a purely
                    psychological picture, represents nothing tangible, nothing but his own soul,
                    Weber gives us physical characterisation. He always relies upon unmistakable
                    outward phenomena, on something of which his audience already have a
                    preconceived idea, as, for instance, fairies. Except in the Pastoral Symphony,
                    Beethoven only paints the impression; Weber paints the thing itself. He imitates
                    the sounds of nature. He makes the violins moan to represent the moaning of the
                    trees; the rising of the moon is announced and depicted by a chord. When he
                    gives us a rhythmic succession of non-resonant beats instead of waves of sound,
                    i.e. makes a perfectly arbitrary abstract use of the vehicle of his art; when he
                    confines himself to song and the simplest of harmonies, i.e. elects to be naïve
                    and popular; or when, in order to obtain a grotesque, wild, or spectral effect,
                    he gives instruments parts which lie outside their natural province and compass
                    (for instance deep tones to the clarinets), i.e. employs the mediums of his art
                    in a more strange and eccentric manner than they had ever been employed
                    before--in all these cases he is a thorough-going Romanticist, one who, with his
                    greater genius and far more suitable medium, supplies the shortcomings of which
                    we are invariably conscious in the works of the Romantic poets.[9]</p>

                <p>ATTITUDE OF ROMANTICISM TO ART AND NATURE</p>
                <p>Wackenroder's book, which, as it were, indicates the attitude of Romanticism to
                    music, also indicates what its attitude is to be towards art. Just as
                    Winckelmann, with his first enthusiastic writings, had awakened the desire to
                    study antique art, now Wackenroder enlists men's sympathies for medievalism.</p>
                <p>In his naïve enthusiasm he begins by translating and paraphrasing those portions
                    of Vasari's old biographies of the famous painters which describe the greatness
                    and nobility of mind of the Italian masters. Amongst others he extols Leonardo;
                    but he neither grasps the characteristics of the man nor gives us intelligent
                    criticism of his art; he simply eulogises him under the heading: _Das Muster
                    eines kunstreichen und dabei tiefgelehrten Malers, vorgestellt in dem Leben des
                    Leonardo da Vinci_ (The Gifted and Erudite Painter, as exemplified in the Life
                    of Leonardo da Vinci). The essay begins with the following impulsive assertion:
                    "The period of the resurrection of the art of painting in Italy produced men to
                    whom the generation of to-day should look up as to glorified saints." The fact,
                    actually chronicled by Vasari, that the great painters of the Italian
                    Renaissance led singularly unsaintly lives, is entirely ignored. In its very
                    germ the Romantic conception of art is poisoned by the reaction towards
                    sentiment. The critic folds his hands to worship, and forgets to open his eyes
                    to see.</p>
                <p>Amongst the translated fragments Wackenroder introduces a short original essay,
                    entitled _Longing for Italy_, in which we have the first appearance of that
                    enthusiasm for Italy which afterwards becomes not only general, but almost
                    obligatory. Love and longing for Italy was nothing new in Germany. Goethe's
                    father, who was no enthusiast, had known this feeling; but now idolatry of an
                    Italy which had no resemblance to the real one became a necessary clause in the
                    creed of every genuine Romanticist. In poetry the longing for Italy found
                    expression in a profusion of lyrical poems, dilutions and attenuations of that
                    divine song of Mignon's, which is a picture as well as a poem. Mignon is content
                    with saying:</p>
                <p>"Die Myrthe _still_ und _hoch_ der Lorbeer steht"; the Romantic poets express
                    themselves in superlatives. The Italy of literature in general may perhaps be
                    best and most briefly defined as the Italy of Leopold Robert (though even this
                    definition is too exact), a country which never existed on any map but that of
                    the Romanticists. The real Italy, with its bright colours and its cheerful life,
                    is not to be found. Colour is replaced by ideal forms; movement is petrified,
                    that it may not disturb an interplay of beautiful waving lines. To the
                    Romanticists Italy became what Dulcinea was to Don Quixote, an ideal of which
                    they knew almost nothing beyond what was conveyed by a few general, vapid
                    descriptive phrases. When a definite, real country is advanced to be the object
                    of men's longings, the home of beauty, it gradually loses, in their depictions
                    of it, all its real, living beauty. But it never was the real, living beauty of
                    Italy which the later Romanticists loved; it was Italy as a ruin; it was
                    Catholicism as a mummy; it was the dwarfed and stunted spirit of the people
                    (Volksgeist), which, hermetically sealed up by a partly ignorant, partly
                    ambitious and designing priesthood, has remained unenlightened and naïve. What
                    they admired here, as elsewhere, was the feeble, lifeless poetry of a day that
                    was dead and gone.</p>
                <p>But this cult of Italy and of the pious, or seemingly pious Italian painters, is
                    only the stepping-stone by which the "Friar" passes to the worship of his own
                    particular idol, Albert Dürer. With his enthusiasm for this apostle of German
                    art is combined enthusiasm for ancient Nuremberg. When Tieck and Wackenroder
                    travelled together through Germany in 1793, Nuremberg was their chief place of
                    pilgrimage. The oftener they saw the town, the more affection, nay devotion, did
                    they conceive for it. "The art life of Germany revealed itself to them there in
                    all its fulness. That of which they had hitherto only divined the possibility,
                    had here long been a living reality. How rich in monuments of all the arts was
                    this town, with its churches of St. Sebald and St. Lorenz, its works by Albert
                    Dürer, Vischer, and Krafft! Artistic feeling and ardent industry had here
                    elevated handicraft to the rank of art. Every house was a monument of the past;
                    every well, every bench, bore witness to the citizens of the quiet, simple,
                    thoughtful life of their forefathers. No whitewash had as yet reduced the houses
                    to uniformity. There they stood in all their stateliness, each with its carven
                    imagery, borrowed from poem and legend. Ottnit, Siegenot, Dietrich, and other
                    old heroes, were to be seen above the doors, guarding and protecting the home.
                    Over the old imperial city, with its marvels and its oddities, hung a fragrance
                    which in other places had long ago been blown away by the winds of political
                    change and enlightenment."[1] Nuremberg is, in very deed, a splendid old town,
                    but it is easy to understand the special attraction there must have been for two
                    budding Romanticists in its medievalism, its old Catholic churches, its old
                    houses with the Nibelungen heroes above the doors. Their enthusiasm over the
                    treasures of beautiful Nuremberg is, truth to say, far more natural than the
                    long blindness of the eighteenth century to them. As to Lessing the word
                    "Gothic" had simply meant "barbaric," so to Winckelmann the German Renaissance
                    had been a closed book. Now the splendours of Nuremberg were gazed on by eager
                    eyes. In a species of æsthetic intoxication the friends wandered round the
                    churches and the churchyards; they stood by the graves of Albert Dürer and Hans
                    Sachs; a vanished world rose before their eyes, and the life of ancient
                    Nuremberg became to them the romance of art. The chapter in the _Herzensergüsse_
                    entitled _In Memory of Albert Dürer_ is the first-fruits of these sentiments,
                    and at the same time an expression of the warm patriotic feeling of the young
                    author. "In the days when Albert was wielding the brush, the German still played
                    a distinctly characteristic and notable part on the stage of the world; and
                    Dürer's pictures faithfully reproduce the serious, straightforward, strong
                    German character, its spirit as well as its outward lineaments. In our days this
                    vigorous German character has vanished, in art as well as in life.... The German
                    art of those days was a pious youth, who had received a homely upbringing in a
                    small town, amongst his relations--it has now become the conventional man of the
                    world, who has lost the stamp of the small town, and along with it his
                    originality."</p>
                <p>Yet this patriotic feeling in art is not Wackenroder's fundamental feeling; it is
                    based upon a more comprehensive one. The little book inveighs throughout against
                    all intolerance in art. Freedom from every compulsory rule, a freedom based upon
                    deep and genuine love of beauty, is proclaimed in language which betrays the
                    mimosa-like sensitiveness of this prophet of the new gospel of art. "He," says
                    Wackenroder, "whose more sensitive nerves are keenly alive to the mysterious
                    attraction which lies hidden in art, will often be deeply moved by what leaves
                    another callous. He has the good fortune to have more frequent opportunities
                    than other men for healthy mental excitement and activity."</p>
                <p>Such excitement and activity were, as we have seen, most easily and most
                    naturally called forth by the musical treatment of poetry and by music
                    itself--much less naturally by clearly defined corporeal forms of art.</p>
                <p>If our supposition that Wackenroder's theory of art finds its true and highest
                    development in the distinctively musical type of poetry be correct, it is easy
                    to foretell what will be the result of Tieck's determination to write (with the
                    assistance of his friend's posthumous papers) a tale embodying the "Friar's"
                    longings and theories. The letters written by the German painter in Rome to his
                    friend in Nuremberg became the germ of the new art-romance, _The Wanderings of
                    Franz Sternbald, a Story of Olden Germany_. The book takes its name from its
                    hero, a painter of the days of Albert Dürer. The delineation of character is
                    vague and weak; the action is swamped in dialogue; events play as freely and
                    fantastically as in dreams (and of dreams we have any number) with the feeble
                    talking figures who do duty for heroes and heroines; and even the sequence of
                    these events is constantly interrupted by the insertion of songs improvised to
                    order, which may be best described by quoting a saying of Sternbald's friend,
                    Florestan, namely, that it ought to be possible to construct in words and verse
                    a whole conversation consisting of nothing but sound. When the thread of event
                    is most attenuated and the silk of the verse most thinly spun, music proper is
                    called in. The primitive strains of horn or pipe are so frequently introduced
                    that the author himself in a later work, _Zerbino_, jests at this superfluity of
                    horn music.</p>
                <p>In one of Caroline Schlegel's letters we find Goethe's apt criticism of the book.
                    He said that it ought by rights to have been called _Musical Wanderings_; that
                    there was everything imaginable in it except a painter; that if it were intended
                    for an art-romance, art should have received quite different and more
                    comprehensive treatment; that there was no real substance in the book, and that
                    its artistic tendency was an erroneous one; that there were beautiful sunsets in
                    it, but that they were repeated too often. Much severer, however, and more
                    penetrating is Caroline's own criticism. She writes: "As to Part First, I shall
                    only say that I am still in doubt whether Tieck did not intend to represent
                    Sternbald's devotion to art as something regrettable, a mistaken, fruitless
                    devotion, like Wilhelm Meister's. If this be the case, then there is another
                    fault, namely, the want of _human_ interest in the story. Part Second throws no
                    light on the matter. In it there is the same vagueness, the same want of power.
                    One is always hoping for something decisive, always expecting Franz to make
                    notable progress in one direction or another; but he never does. Once more we
                    read of beautiful sunrises, the charms of spring, the alternation of day and
                    night, the light of sun, moon, and stars, the singing of birds. It is all very
                    charming, but there is a want of substance in it, and a certain paltriness both
                    in Sternbald's moods and emotions and in the delineation of them. There are
                    almost too many poems, and they have as little connection with each other as
                    have the loosely strung together events and anecdotes, in many of which latter,
                    moreover, one detects all sorts of imitation."</p>
                <p>But if there be no action in this book, what does it contain? Reflections--in the
                    first instance upon art, in the second upon nature.</p>
                <p>First we have endless meditations and quantities of aphorisms on art and poetry,
                    interspersed with feeble lyric poems, which are hardly distinguishable one from
                    the other. Only one among the number, a longish poem on Arion, is at all
                    remarkable. It indicates the spirit of the book. The three leaders of
                    Romanticism, A. W. Schlegel, Tieck, and Novalis, all sang the praises of Arion,
                    and somewhat later he was hymned in Danish by P. L. Möller. It was natural that
                    the hearts of the Romanticists should be stirred by the legend of the
                    poet-subduer of nature, who roused the enthusiasm of the very monsters of the
                    sea, rode upon dolphins, was invulnerable, invincible, of immortal fame. He was
                    their symbol, their hero. All their poetry is, in a certain sense, an attempt to
                    expound the legend of Arion; and what else are all the echoes and imitations of
                    their works, the books which glorify poets, artists, actors, troubadours, heroic
                    and irresistible tenors? The figure of Narcissus would be the fitting
                    frontispiece for all these innumerable volumes.</p>
                <p>As a matter of fact the main ingredients of _Sternbald_ are trite refutations of
                    the trite objection to art, that it is useless, trivial reasons for art being
                    national ("since we are not Italians, and an Italian can never feel as a German
                    does"), and hymns in praise of Albert Dürer. It is their admiration for Dürer
                    that first brings the two lovers together, just as Werther and Lotte were first
                    united by their common enthusiasm for Klopstock. The same ideas found expression
                    in Danish in Sibbern's _Gabrielis_ and Oehlenschläger's _Correggio_. Parts of
                    the plot of _Correggio_ are anticipated; we have, for instance, the artist
                    painting his own wife as the Madonna, and his grief at having to part with his
                    work. A long word-symphony in honour of Strasburg Cathedral is followed by
                    bitter thrusts at the "uncouth masses of stone in Milan and Pisa, and that
                    disjointed building, the Cathedral of Lucca." Then we have admiration and praise
                    of Till Eulenspiegel and Hans Wurst (these gentlemen being supposed to represent
                    fancy and irony), and great enthusiasm for Dürer's stag with the cross between
                    its antlers, and for the "simple-hearted, pious, and touching" manner in which
                    the knight in front of it bends his knees. The picture in question is
                    undoubtedly a beautiful, simple-minded production, but we cannot help smiling at
                    the serious attempt made to prove that of all the ways in which the legs of a
                    kneeling man can be bent, this is by far the most Christian.</p>
                <p>Again and again the idea recurs that all true art must be allegorical, that is to
                    say, marrowless and bloodless. Most of the poems are allegories. The principal
                    one is the long allegory of Phantasus, wretched verse without one spark of
                    imagination:</p>
                <p> "Der launige Phantasus, Ein wunderlicher Alter, Folgt stets seiner närrischen
                    Laune. Sie haben ihn jetzt festgebunden, Dass er nur seine Possen lässt,
                    Vernunft im Denken nicht stört, Den armen Menschen nicht irrt," &amp;c.,
                    &amp;c.[2]</p>
                <p>Reminiscences of this satire upon the attacks made on imagination by the prosaic
                    are to be found here and there in Andersen's _Fairy Tales_. The poem, which is
                    recited in the moonlight, indicates as an ideal subject for the painter a
                    pilgrim in the moonlight, the emblem of humanity: "For what are we but
                    wandering, erring pilgrims? Can aught but the light from above illumine our
                    path?" There are distinct traces of this same tendency in our own poet, Hauch,
                    with his perpetual pointing "upwards" and his partiality for pilgrims and
                    hermits.</p>
                <p>But in Romanticism at this stage, in spite of all its bloodless spirituality,
                    sensuality still wells up strong and unrestrained. Franz Sternbald, the trained
                    artist, maintains the superiority of Titian and Correggio to all other painters.
                    Of Correggio, whom he especially favours, he says: "Who would dare to vie with
                    him, at least in the representation of voluptuous love? To no other human spirit
                    has there been granted such a revelation of the glories of the realm of the
                    senses."</p>
                <p>This standpoint was, as every one knows, soon relinquished, consistency leading
                    to the adoption of another. The brothers Sulpice and Melchior Boisserée of
                    Cologne were in Paris in 1802, when Friedrich Schlegel was studying there, and
                    they had private lectures from him. The old German pictures in the Louvre
                    reminded the young men of old paintings in their native town, which the
                    prevailing academic taste had consigned to oblivion. In consequence of
                    Napoleon's systematic pillage of pictures, there was a good collection of German
                    ones in Paris, which made the study of them an easy matter.</p>
                <p>The best idea of what the German medieval artists had produced was to be obtained
                    from the quantities of paintings and wood and stone carving which came into the
                    market after the suppression of monasteries and charitable foundations. At that
                    time men had lost all appreciation for monuments of art; with the utmost
                    indifference they saw churches turned into quarries, and the most precious
                    artistic treasures dispersed to the four winds. Masterpieces were sold for a
                    trifle, and the purchasers of the supposed old rubbish were actually pitied.
                    Altar-pieces were made into window-shutters, dovecots, tables, and roofing; the
                    caretakers in the monasteries often used old paintings on wood as fuel, for as a
                    rule even the best were unrecognisable, from taper-smoke, dust, and dirt.[3]</p>
                <p>After Friedrich Schlegel, in his periodical, Europa, had drawn attention to the
                    wealth of old German paintings, the brothers Boisserée began to collect the
                    scattered treasures, travelling up and down the Rhine and throughout the
                    Netherlands to track out the long-despised works. By 1805 a collection of
                    Flemish and German masters had been made, which exercised great influence on the
                    history of art.</p>
                <p>The revival of enthusiasm for early German art led to predilection for the
                    pre-Raphaelite Italian painters. All honour to the pre-Raphaelites! From Fiesole
                    and Giotto to Masaccio, Botticelli, Ghirlandajo, Luca Signorelli, Perugino, and
                    Pinturicchio, all Europe pays them the homage that is their due. But Friedrich
                    Schlegel, in his article in _Europa_ on Raphael, exalts the pre-Raphaelite at
                    the expense of the succeeding period. He says: "With this newer school, typified
                    by such names as Raphael, Correggio, Giulio Romano, and Michael Angelo, begins
                    the decay of art." And this is considered to be so patent a fact that Schlegel
                    does not think it necessary to offer any justification of his assertion; nay,
                    two pages later he actually confesses that he has not seen any of Michael
                    Angelo's works. Here we have the perfection of Romantic insolence. This paragon
                    of an art critic, who, in order the better to exalt the old monkish pictures,
                    dates the decay of art from Raphael, Correggio, Titian, and Michael Angelo,
                    admits without the slightest feeling of shame that he has not seen so much as
                    one of the works of the greatest of these men. Despising such a paltry thing as
                    knowledge, he judges him with his inner consciousness.</p>
                <p>But it is unnecessary to anticipate; for in _Sternbald_ itself monkish piety,
                    with all its languishing fanaticism, has already come to life again in an
                    unctuousness without parallel. This it was which so irritated Goethe. The idea
                    that piety lies at the foundation of all true art, a theory which was speedily
                    adopted by the whole school of neo-German "Nazarenic" painters, he constantly
                    jeered at. An expression he often used in speaking of the "Nazarenes" was, that
                    they Sternbaldised (_sternbaldisierten_).</p>
                <p>The essay on Winckelmann which Goethe published about this time was a direct
                    attack upon the Romanticists. In it he writes: "This description of the antique
                    mind, with its concentration upon this world and its blessings, leads directly
                    to the reflection that such advantages are only compatible with a pagan spirit.
                    That self-confidence, that living and acting in the present, that simple
                    reverence for the gods as ancestors and admiration for them as if they were
                    works of art, that resignation to an inevitable fate, and that belief in a
                    future of highly prized posthumous fame, all these things together constitute
                    such an indivisible whole, unite in such a manner to form the human existence
                    designed by nature herself, that those pagans show themselves alike robust and
                    sane in the supreme moment of enjoyment and in the dread moment of
                    self-sacrifice or annihilation. This pagan spirit is apparent in all
                    Winckelmann's actions and writings.... And we must keep this frame of mind of
                    his, this remoteness from, nay, this actual antipathy to the Christian
                    standpoint, in view when we judge his so-called change of religion. Winckelmann
                    felt that, in order to be a Roman in Rome, in order really to live the life of
                    the place, it was necessary that he should become a member of the Catholic
                    Church, subscribe to its beliefs, and conform to its usages.... The decision
                    came all the more easily to him in that, born pagan as he was, Protestant
                    baptism had not availed to make a Christian of him.... There is no doubt that a
                    certain opprobrium, which it seems impossible to avoid, attaches to every man
                    who changes his religion. This shows us that what men set most store by is
                    steadfastness; and they value it the more because, themselves divided into
                    parties, they have their own peace and security always in view. Where destiny
                    rather than choice has placed us, there we are to remain.... So much for a very
                    serious side of the question; there is a much lighter and more cheerful one.
                    Certain positions taken up by others, of which we do not approve, certain of
                    their moral offences, have a peculiar attraction for our imagination.... People
                    whom we should otherwise think of as merely notable, or amiable, now seem to us
                    very mysterious, and it cannot be denied that Winckelmann's change of religion
                    has added greatly to the _romance_ of his life and character."</p>
                <p>We can fancy how such an utterance enraged the Romanticists, who at that time
                    were all on the point of going over to Catholicism. Thenceforward there was no
                    more worship of Goethe. Tieck was in Rome, and the report spread that he was
                    about to embrace the Catholic faith, to which his wife and daughter had become
                    converts. Friedrich Schlegel was preparing to take the final step. He was
                    lecturing at Cologne, but making application for a regular appointment in every
                    likely quarter--Cologne, Paris, Würzburg, Munich, &amp;c. "Given really tempting
                    conditions," he wrote in June 1804, "I should have gone even to Moscow or
                    Dorpat. But," he adds, "my preference was for the Rhine district." Was this
                    because it was a Catholic district? Not at all. "The salmon here is unequalled,
                    so are the crayfish, not to speak of the wine." It was Metternich's pecuniary
                    offer which finally induced him to take the decisive step and join the Church of
                    Rome. He was furious at the essay on Winckelmann, though he expressed unbounded
                    contempt for it. What is most amusing of all, however, is to see how this little
                    work fell like a bomb among the genuine political reactionaries in Vienna. Gentz
                    was already approaching the stage which he had reached when he wrote to Rahel
                    (in 1814) that he had become terribly old and bad (unendlich alt und schlecht),
                    describing his condition thus: "I must give you an idea of the form which my
                    cynicism and egotism have taken. As soon as I can throw down my pen, all my
                    thoughts and time are given to the arrangement of my rooms; I am constantly
                    planning how to procure more money for furniture, perfumes, and every refinement
                    of so-called luxury. My appetite, alas! is gone. Breakfast is the only meal I
                    take any interest in."</p>
                <p>In 1805 Gentz writes to his worthy friend, Adam Müller: "What struck me most in
                    your letter was your criticism of Goethe's two latest productions. I know them
                    both, but should never have dared to write as you do; though I will not deny
                    that my opinion of them is the same as yours, only still less favourable. The
                    notes on _Rameau_ are simply prosy and commonplace. To write such twaddle
                    nowadays about Voltaire and D'Alembert is really inexcusable in a Goethe. The
                    essays on Winckelmann are atheistic. I should never have credited Goethe with
                    such a bitter and perfidious hatred of Christianity, though I have long
                    suspected him of culpability in this matter. What indecent, cynical, faun-like
                    joy he seems to have felt on making the grand discovery that it was really
                    because Winckelmann was a "born pagan" that the different forms of the Christian
                    religion were a matter of such indifference to him! No! even Goethe will not
                    easily rise again in my estimation after these two books!"[4]</p>
                <p>Goethe's essay, we observe, had gone straight to the mark; the Romanticists felt
                    as if they had received a slap in the face, when he declared himself hostile to
                    their theory of art.</p>
                <p>We must now dwell a little on the conception of nature which corresponds to this
                    conception of art. In _Sternbald_, as both Goethe and Caroline indicate, the
                    reader's interest is distracted from the characters and the action by
                    descriptions of scenery.</p>
                <p>We have seen that it was Rousseau who rediscovered the feeling for nature. As
                    Sainte-Beuve says somewhere, playing upon Rousseau's own words about the swallow
                    which had built its nest under the eaves of his first home: "He was the swallow
                    that foretold the coming of summer in literature." The same feeling for nature,
                    as has also been shown, reappears in _Werther_. The transformation which it now
                    underwent was this: Rousseau's point of view had been _emotional_, that of the
                    Romanticists was _fantastic_. Hence their return to legends and fairy tales, to
                    the elves and kobolds of popular superstition. Goethe had said:</p>
                <p> "Natur hat weder Kern noch Schale, Alles ist sie mit einem Male."[5]</p>
                <p>The Romanticists were determined to have to do only with the kernel, with the
                    mysterious inmost substance, which they attempted to extricate, after having
                    themselves inserted it. The mystic mind mirrored itself in nature and saw in it
                    nothing but mysteries. Tieck, as every one knows, coined the word
                    _Waldeinsamkeit_ (his friends maintained that it ought to be
                    _Waldeseinsamkeit_). Romanticism shouted with quavering voice into the
                    Waldeinsamkeit (forest solitude), and echo returned quavering answers.</p>
                <p>Alexander von Humboldt has pointed out how the ancients really only saw beauty in
                    nature when she was smiling, friendly, and _useful_ to man. With the
                    Romanticists it is the reverse. To them nature is unbeautiful in proportion as
                    she is useful, and most beautiful in her wildness, or when she awakens a feeling
                    of vague fear. They rejoice in the darkness of night and of deep ravines, in the
                    utter loneliness which produces a shudder of terror; and Tieck's full moon
                    shines as unchangeably over the landscape as though it were a theatrical one of
                    oiled paper with a lamp behind it. I call it Tieck's moon, because it is
                    incontestably Tieck who is the originator of the Romantic moonlit landscape. Nor
                    is it difficult to understand how it should be he, rather than any other of the
                    young writers, who originates such expressions as "forest solitude," "magic
                    moonlit nights," &amp;c., &amp;c. Tieck was born in Berlin, perhaps of all large
                    towns the one whose surroundings possess the fewest natural attractions. Those
                    sandy heaths of Brandenburg, with their tall, spare firs standing stiffly in
                    rows like Prussian soldiers, form as meagre a landscape as one could well find.
                    Whilst Rousseau, living amidst scenery of paradisaic beauty (the neighbourhood
                    of Geneva and Mont Blanc), was strongly, directly impressed by nature, Tieck, in
                    his unlovely surroundings, was seized by the city-dweller's morbid longing for
                    wood and mountain; and this longing gave birth to a fantastic conception of
                    nature. The cold daylight glare of Berlin, and its modern, North German
                    rationalism awoke longings for the primeval forests and an inclination towards
                    primitive poetry.</p>
                <p>To prove the truth of this assertion, one has only to read such a passage in the
                    biography of Tieck as the following account of his stay in Halle in 1792: "How
                    entirely different was the nature which met his eyes here in the green valley of
                    the Saale, how much richer and more friendly than the flat heaths surrounding
                    Berlin! The feeling of infinite longing seized him with redoubled force, and
                    filled his heart with almost painful excitement as he wandered through the woods
                    in the springtime. Once more he became intoxicated with nature; a mysterious
                    power seemed to drive him onwards. His favourite resting-place was the Hölty
                    bench near Giebichenstein, from which he overlooked the river and the valley.
                    How often did he watch the sun sink beneath the clouds and the moon mirror
                    herself with a thousand golden beams in the rippling water, or gleam dreamily
                    through the branches! Here he lay many a summer night, drinking in nature in
                    ample draughts."</p>
                <p>Is not this the longing for nature of the man who is an exile from it, the view
                    of nature which has the city pavement as its background?</p>
                <p>In the description given of the evening after a tiring walk taken by Tieck and
                    Wackenroder in the Fichtelgebirge, Tieck's conception of nature is still more
                    distinctly associated with his personal impressions: "Wackenroder, unaccustomed
                    to such fatigue, flung himself at once upon the bed, but Tieck was too excited.
                    He could not sleep after all the experiences of that day. The spirits of nature
                    awoke. He opened the window. It was the mildest, most magnificent summer night.
                    The moon shed her soft, clear beams upon him. There it was before his eyes, the
                    moonlit, witching night, nature with her ancient, yet ever new marvels and
                    magic! His heart once again swelled high. To what far, unknown goal was he being
                    drawn with irresistible force? Softly and soothingly the clear tones of a horn
                    came floating through the night. A feeling of sadness stole over him, and yet he
                    was intensely happy."[6]</p>
                <p>Observe that not even the horn is wanting. What is wanting, what Tieck is
                    destitute of, is any definite aim. We have the same thing in _Sternbald_, where
                    the wandering artist, led only by his longings and his prophetic enthusiasm, is
                    always, as he himself confesses, forgetting his real aim. "It is not possible,"
                    says one of the characters in the book, "to forget one's aim, for this reason,
                    that the sensible man arranges matters so that he has no aim." No one can fail
                    to see the close connection between this particular species of feeling for
                    nature and Romantic arbitrariness, nor how they mutually develop each other.</p>
                <p>Let us see the kind of landscapes which Franz Sternbald understands and paints,
                    and how he understands and paints them.</p>
                <p>In one part of the book we read: "This was the landscape which Franz intended to
                    paint; but the real scene seemed very prosaic to him, compared with its
                    reflection in the water." Clear outlines, definite forms, are dry prose; but the
                    reflection in the water, the picture as it were to its second power, is Romantic
                    refinement, duplication, glorification. In another part Franz says: "I should
                    choose to paint lonely, terrible scenes--ruinous, crumbling bridges spanning the
                    space between two precipitous rocks, with a foaming torrent raging in the abyss
                    below; strayed travellers whose cloaks flap in the wet wind; horrid brigands
                    rushing from their caves, stopping and plundering carriages, and fighting with
                    travellers." Real stage scenery this, with melodrama into the bargain!</p>
                <p>And in what spirit is nature apprehended? "Sometimes," says Franz, "my
                    imagination sets to work and will not rest until it has thought out something
                    quite unheard of. It would have me paint strange objects, of complicated and
                    almost incomprehensible construction--figures composed of parts of all kinds of
                    animals, their lower extremities being plants; insects and reptiles with a
                    strange humanness about them, expressing human moods and passions in a wonderful
                    and horrible manner."</p>
                <p>What a picture! what a jumble of monstrosities! Can you not hear Hoffmann fast
                    approaching with his caravan of monsters? The elephant stands on his head, and
                    has a trunk which ends in a garfish; the cat writes its memoirs; the
                    door-knocker is really an old market-woman, &amp;c., &amp;c. Are we not reminded
                    here again, as in _Der Freischütz_, of the temptations of St. Anthony, as
                    painted by Teniers, or, better still, by Höllen-Breughel, with a regular
                    witches' Sabbath. To the genuine Romanticist, nature, with all her myriads of
                    living forms and beings, seems a great toy-cupboard, and all the toys babble and
                    chatter like those in Andersen's fairy tale.</p>
                <p>Read this description of a romantic landscape taken from Novalis's _Heinrich von
                    Ofterdingen_: "From a height they looked down upon a romantic country, strewn
                    with towns and castles, with temples and tombs, a country which united the
                    gentle charms of inhabited plains with the terrible charms of deserts and
                    precipitous mountains. The most beautiful colours were happily blended. Mountain
                    peaks gleamed like fireworks in their coverings of ice and snow. The smiling
                    plain was clothed in the freshest of green. The distance decked itself in every
                    shade of blue, and the deep blue of the sea threw into relief the innumerable
                    bright pennons waving from the masts of numerous fleets. In the background we
                    could see a shipwreck, in the foreground a merry country feast; far off the
                    terribly beautiful eruption of a volcano and the desolation wrought by an
                    earthquake, and near at hand a pair of lovers exchanging the sweetest caresses
                    under sheltering trees. On one side of this scene a frightful battle was raging,
                    and at no great distance from the battle was to be seen a theatre with a
                    ludicrous play going on. Upon the other side, in the foreground, the corpse of a
                    young girl lay upon a bier, with an inconsolable lover and weeping parents
                    kneeling by its side; in the background sat a sweet mother with her child at her
                    breast, angels nestling at her feet, and peeping through the branches above her
                    head."</p>
                <p>What a pot-pourri! And over it all is shed the indispensable pale, yellow light
                    of that friend and well-wisher, protector and betrayer of lovers, that supreme
                    comforter and divinity of the Romanticists--the man in the moon. He is their
                    salvation. His round face and his profile have exactly the degree of
                    distinctness permissible or possible in a Romantic countenance. All the knights
                    of Romanticism wear his yellow livery. And a truer knight of the moon than Franz
                    Sternbald is not to be found.</p>
                <p>"I would," he says, "that I could fill the whole world with my song of love, that
                    I could move the moonlight and the rosy dawn, so that they should echo my grief
                    and happiness, until trees, branches, leaves, and grass all took up the melody,
                    repeating it as with millions of tongues." Hereupon he sings a "moonlight
                    song":</p>
                <p> "Hinter'm Wasser wie flimmernde Flammen, Berggipfel oben mit Gold beschienen,
                    Neigen rauschend und ernst die grünen Gebüsche die blinkenden Häupter
                    zusammen.</p>
                <p> Welle, rollst du herauf den Schein, Des Mondes rund freundlich Angesicht? Es
                    merkt's und freundlich bewegt sich der Hain, Streckt die Zweig' entgegen dem
                    Zauberlicht.</p>
                <p> Fangen die Geister an auf den Fluthen zu springen, Thun sich die Nachtblumen auf
                    mit Klingen, Wacht die Nachtigall im dicksten Baum, Verkündigt dichterisch ihren
                    Traum. Wie helle, blendende Strahlen die Töne nieder fliessen, Am Bergeshang den
                    Wiederhall zu grüssen."[7]</p>
                <p>Here we have it all! The glittering flames of the moon, bushes with twinkling
                    heads, rolling billows bearing onwards the face of the full moon, spirits
                    dancing upon waves, night as described by Novalis, night flowers, and a
                    nightingale whose song flows like clear, dazzling moonbeams.</p>
                <p>And exactly the same thing recurs again and again. Franz has a dream:
                    "Unperceived, he painted the hermit and his devotion, the forest and its
                    moonlight; he even succeeded, he himself knew not how, in getting the
                    nightingale's song into his picture." Oh, that musical pictorial art! Was not
                    Goethe right in saying that there is more music than painting in the book?</p>
                <p>It is very significant that the man who revelled thus in the fantastic
                    suggestions of a district where nature was poor and sterile, should have
                    altogether failed to appreciate the richness and luxuriance, the abundance of
                    healthy sap and vigour, which distinguish the south of England. Shakespeare has
                    had few such fervent admirers as Tieck; and Tieck naturally had the desire to
                    see with his own eyes the natural surroundings amidst which his great teacher
                    and master had spent his life, and from which he had derived his earliest
                    impressions. He expected much. But, oh! what a disappointment! That mind which
                    fancied itself akin to Shakespeare's found nothing congenial in the scenery
                    round Shakespeare's home. The chief characteristic of these counties is an
                    almost incredible luxuriance and vigour of growth. But this wealth of vegetation
                    is unpoetical to the Romanticist, because it is useful, because it has a
                    purpose. Only the blossom which bears no fruit is romantic. We understand his
                    disappointment. Nowhere else does one see such mighty, spreading oaks, nowhere
                    such high and succulent grass. As far as the eye can reach, the green carpet
                    spreads over the undulating fields and the rich meadows, where magnificent
                    cattle graze and ruminate. Quantities of white, yellow, and blue meadow and
                    field flowers break the monotony of colour, and breathe a perfume which the
                    moisture of the air keeps so fresh that it never palls. This vegetation is above
                    all else fresh, not, like that of the south, striking in its contours. The
                    watery, juicy plant does not live long; life streams through it and is gone. The
                    moist air envelops trees and plants in a sort of luminous vapour which catches
                    and tempers the sunbeams; and, as in Denmark, banks of clouds constantly
                    traverse the pale blue sky. When this sky happens to be for a short time
                    perfectly clear, and the sun reaches the earth without passing through mist, the
                    rain and dewdrops sparkle on the green grass and upon the silken and velvet
                    petals of the myriads of gay flowers more brilliantly than diamonds. What matter
                    that the grass is destined to be eaten? Does not part of its beauty lie in its
                    nutritious look? What matter that the fruitful fields are cultivated with the
                    assistance of all the newest agricultural machinery, or that the cattle are
                    tended with the most intelligent solicitude? Is not this the very reason why
                    both animals and plants look so strong, so well nourished, and so nourishing?
                    What we have here is certainly not the imposing beauty of the desert or the
                    ocean, or of Swiss scenery. But has not this landscape a poetry of its own? Who
                    can have spent an evening in Kew Gardens without mentally placing the elfin
                    dance from _A Midsummer Night's Dream_, or _The Merry Wives of Windsor_ in
                    exactly this scenery, these beautiful parks, with their gigantic old oaks? It
                    was in these surroundings that Shakespeare wrote them. We can divine with what
                    eyes he looked upon the landscape. With what eyes does Tieck look upon it?
                    "Having seen London," says Köpke, "he wished to make acquaintance with some
                    other part of England. Where should he turn his steps, if not to Shakespeare's
                    birthplace? On the way he visited Oxford. But neither was this scenery to his
                    taste. The country they drove through was luxuriantly green, splendidly
                    cultivated; but it was too well ordered, too artificial (No primitive poetry!);
                    it had lost its originality. It lacked that simplicity, that holiness, as he
                    called it, which touches the heart, and by which he had so often been moved in
                    the most sterile parts of his native land. Here industry had destroyed the
                    poetic aroma."</p>
                <p>It is clear, then, that there must have been something in the scenery of his own
                    country which appealed to Tieck's personal predispositions. The fantastic
                    conception of nature would not have been carried to such an extreme in this
                    particular country, if there had not been something fantastic in the scenery of
                    the country. It is very evident that German scenery must have met the fantastic
                    spectator half way.</p>
                <p>In the first volume of this work, I attempted, by means of a description of
                    Italian scenery, to show how unromantic even the most beautiful of it is. Nor,
                    in spite of the Black Forest and the Blocksberg, can German scenery be called
                    really fantastic; for, as Taine says, it is only the beauty of art which is
                    fantastic; that of nature is more than fantastic; the fantastic does not exist
                    except in our human brain. Still, nature does provide excuses for a certain
                    amount of fantasy. It is especially to be born in mind that in
                    characteristically German scenery the sea is absent, and with it the feeling of
                    wideness and freeness which it alone gives. In river and mountain scenery there
                    is never the wide, open horizon to which we Danes are accustomed.</p>
                <p>But, not to lose myself in generalisations, let me give an idea of the scenery
                    amidst which Tieck himself lived longest--that district in the neighbourhood of
                    Dresden which goes by the name of Saxon Switzerland. I shall describe in a few
                    words how it impresses me, and then proceed to show what impression it produces
                    on a Romantic poet. This I can do reliably and exactly, for I have personally
                    known several Romantic poets, and have recently travelled through the district
                    in question in company with an old poet of Romantic tendencies.</p>
                <p>We had spent some days in the clear mountain air, looking out over the high open
                    country and rocky peaks of Bohemia, which resemble a sea, with sharply outlined
                    mountains emerging like islands--an interminable stretch of fields and pine-clad
                    rocks. We went through the Uttenwalder Grund up to the Bastei. The valley is
                    shut in by high, fantastic sandstone rocks, piled up in layers, with pine trees
                    clustering in every crevice. The upper part of the rock often projects
                    threateningly over the lower, seeming as though about to fall. One sees many
                    strange freaks of nature--gateways, even triple gateways. In climbing up to the
                    Bastei, one has on the left that remarkable landscape with the steep rocks
                    standing out like giant gravestones--tragic, awe-inspiring scenery, that would
                    make a fitting background for the dance of the dead nuns in _Robert le Diable_.
                    Standing on the Bastei, one looks over the great plain with its precipitous
                    mountain islands (the fortress of Königstein is built upon one of these),
                    straight, hard lines, absolutely unpicturesque. Kuhstall is an enormous dome of
                    rock. The whole scenery has the appearance of being designed by man, of being a
                    fantastic art production. The last time I saw it, in glorious sunlight, the view
                    was marvellously imposing. Over the great pine-forest which clothed the lower
                    heights, its tree-tops looking like felt or wool, lay a bluish green haze, which
                    spread up the sides of the surrounding hills. The Bohemian villages lay in
                    groups, shining like windows in the sun--in the distance were basaltic
                    mountains, nearer at hand pyramidal, square, or obelisk-shaped rocks. Wherever a
                    single deciduous tree stood among the pines, its yellow autumnal leaves shone
                    amidst their dark surroundings like patches of gold. The only other yellow was
                    that of the lichen upon some of the rocks. These rocks looked as though giants
                    in the morning of time had pelted each other with them, as children pelt each
                    other with stones, or had played at heaping them one on the top of another.</p>
                <p>From the Wintersberg the hills look like the remains of a Cyclopean city. An
                    enormous rock, steep and smooth as a wall, stands, decked with firs, in the
                    centre of a wide landscape. Of all one sees, Prebischthor is perhaps what
                    strikes one as being most beautiful. Here again the rocks have taken a fantastic
                    shape, that of a gateway. A gigantic, beam-like rock has laid itself like a
                    lintel across two rock towers. Sitting under it, one looks down upon two
                    separate landscapes, one through the arch to the left, the other an open one
                    upon the right. As I sat there in the evening, the first was hard, cold,
                    austere; over the other the sun was setting, red and glowing. The one was, as it
                    were, in a major, the other in a minor key; the one was like a face without
                    eyes, the other glowed and beamed.</p>
                <p>Such was this scenery in the eyes of an ordinary, sober-minded traveller. The
                    Romanticist who was my companion seemed to me to be less moved by the spectacle
                    than I was; at least he said very little about it during the course of the day.
                    But when, towards night, we were making our way down the mountain, his
                    imagination was suddenly fired. It was quite dark, and the darkness acted upon
                    his nerves. It seemed to him as if more and more of the spirits of nature came
                    forth, the darker it grew. And when, in the distance, we saw the first points of
                    light coming from the windows of houses on the mountain side, houses which we
                    could not distinguish on account of the darkness, he had the feeling that these
                    windows must be in the rock itself, and that we could see in if we were only
                    near enough. The illuminated panes were to him great eyes, with which the spirit
                    of the mountain looked out at us; he felt as if the wooded hillside were
                    watching us. He was in a weird, eccentric, genuinely Romantic mood, and I could
                    not follow him. But on this occasion I had the opportunity of learning by
                    personal observation how a German Romanticist of the good old days viewed
                    nature; how it was not until night that it really became nature to him; how he
                    did not look at it, but to one side of it or behind it; and by observing how
                    much more, and yet how much less, my companion felt face to face with nature
                    than I did, I arrived at an understanding of the legitimacy and the narrowness,
                    the unnaturalness and the poetry of the Romantic conception of nature.[8]</p>

                    green heads together. Wave, art thou rolling to us the reflection of the round,
                    friendly face of the moon? The trees recognise it, and joyfully stretch forth
                    their branches towards the magic light. The spirits begin to dance on the waves;
                    the flowers of the night unfold their petals with melodious sound; where the
                    leaves are thickest the nightingale awakes and tells her dream; her notes flow
                    forth like clear, dazzling beams, to greet the echo on the mountain side."</p>

                <p>ROMANTIC DUPLICATION AND PSYCHOLOGY</p>
                <p>Those among my readers who have stood in a room lined with mirrors, and seen
                    themselves and everything else reflected _ad infinitum_, above, below, on every
                    side, have some idea of the vertigo which the study of Romantic art at times
                    produces.</p>
                <p>Every one who has read Holberg's _Ulysses von Ithacia_ remembers how droll the
                    effect is when the characters, as they are perpetually doing, make fun of
                    themselves and what they represent--when, for example, Ulysses exhibits the long
                    beard which has grown during the ten years' campaign, or when we read upon a
                    screen, "This is Troy," or when, at the close, the Jews rush in and tear off the
                    actor's back the clothes which he had borrowed to play Ulysses in. Histrionic
                    art, as every one knows, depends for its effect upon illusion. And illusion is
                    an aim common to many of the arts. A statue and a painting deceive quite as much
                    as a play, the illusion being contingent upon our momentarily taking the stone
                    for a human being, and the painted flat surface for receding reality, in exactly
                    the same way as we forget the actor in his rôle. This illusion, however, is only
                    complete for a moment. It is, indeed, possible for the perfectly uneducated man
                    to be entirely deceived. An Indian soldier in Calcutta shot an actor who was
                    playing the part of Othello, exclaiming: "It shall never be said that a negro
                    murdered a white woman in my presence!" But in the case of the educated man, the
                    illusion comes and goes; it comes at the moment when the tragedy brings tears
                    into his eyes, and goes at the moment when he draws out his pocket-handkerchief
                    and looks at his neighbour. The effect of the work of art is, as it were,
                    focussed in this illusion. The illusion is the reflection of the work of art in
                    the spectator's mind--the appearance, the play, by means of which the unreal
                    becomes reality to the spectator.</p>
                <p>In the simple, straightforward work of art no special attention is devoted to
                    illusion; it is not aimed at; nothing is done to strengthen it or to give it
                    piquancy; but still less is anything done to destroy it.</p>
                <p>It is not difficult, however, to understand how a certain piquant quality may be
                    communicated to the illusion produced by any art. When, for instance, a Hermes,
                    or any idol, is represented on a bas-relief, when a picture represents a studio
                    or a room with pictures hanging on the walls, a strong indication is hereby
                    conveyed that the bas-relief itself is not intended to affect us as statuary,
                    nor the pictures as painting. And the same sort of effect is produced when one
                    or other of the characters in a comedy cries: "Do you take me for a
                    stage-uncle?"</p>
                <p>The theatrical illusion is still further heightened, or, to be quite correct, is
                    still more entirely forgotten, when some of the characters in a play themselves
                    perform a play, as in _Hamlet_ or _A Midsummer Night's Dream_. It seems
                    extraordinary or impossible that the spectators of this second play should also
                    be acting. The illusion here is artificially strengthened, and yet at the same
                    time weakened, by attention being drawn to it. It is plain that this play with
                    illusions had an immense attraction for Tieck; it was inevitable that it should
                    have. Since it is illusion which makes art serious reality to the spectator, it
                    is by the destroying of the illusion that he is made to feel strongly that art
                    is free, fanciful play.</p>
                <p>So Tieck mocks ironically at things which are usually ignored in order not to
                    disturb the illusion. In _Puss in Boots_ the King says to Prince Nathaniel: "But
                    do tell me; how is it that you who live so far away can speak our language so
                    fluently?" Nathaniel: "Hush!" The King: "What?" Nathaniel: "Hush, hush! For any
                    sake be quiet, or the audience too will be finding out how unnatural it is."
                    And, sure enough, one of the spectators presently remarks: "Why in the world
                    can't the prince talk a foreign language and have it translated by his
                    interpreter? What utter nonsense it all is!" This last speech is of course
                    sarcasm, aimed at that demand for realism in art of which Iffland and Kotzebue
                    were advocates. We have one expression of the demand in question in the French
                    misconception of the Aristotelian doctrine of the unity of time and place.
                    Writing on this subject, Schlegel, following Lessing's example, remarked that,
                    after one had taken the great plunge and agreed to regard the stage as the
                    world, it was surely easy to take the lesser one and sometimes permit the said
                    stage to represent different localities. And the Romanticists were never weary
                    of extolling the old Shakespearian theatre (where the place represented was
                    simply intimated by a label attached to the scenes) as a higher development of
                    art than that of their own day. The champions of realism in art were at that
                    time advocating the substitution of solid walls for scenes; Schlegel maintained
                    that those who insisted on having three walls on the stage were logically
                    obliged to go a step farther and have a fourth wall, on the side towards the
                    audience.</p>
                <p>It is out of pure defiance of the philistine conception of art that Tieck amuses
                    himself by seating an audience upon the stage and having the play within the
                    play performed to the accompaniment of their critical remarks. They censure,
                    they praise, now condemning a scene as superfluous, now approving the author for
                    his courage in introducing horses upon the stage. While the learned man and the
                    fool are disputing in the palace before the king upon his throne, the former
                    says: "The gist of my argument is, that the new play _Puss in Boots_ is a good
                    play." "That is exactly what I deny," says the fool; whereupon one of the
                    audience cries in amazement: "What! the play itself is mentioned in the
                    play!"</p>
                <p>A still more extraordinary state of matters prevails in _Die Verkehrte Welt_
                    ("The Topsy-turvy World"). As Scaramouch is riding through the forest on his
                    donkey, a thunderstorm suddenly comes on. One naturally expects him to take
                    shelter. Not at all. "Where the deuce does this storm come from?" he cries;
                    "there's not a word about it in my part. What absurd nonsense! My donkey and I
                    are getting soaked. Machinist! machinist! hi! in the devil's name stop it!" The
                    machinist enters and excuses himself, explains that the audience had expressed a
                    desire for stage-thunder, and that he had consequently met their wishes.
                    Scaramouch entreats the audience to change its mind, but to no purpose; thunder
                    they will have. "What! in a sedate historical play?" It thunders again. "It's a
                    very simple matter," says the machinist; "I blow a little pounded colophony
                    through aflame; that makes the lightning; and at the same moment an iron ball is
                    rolled overhead, and there you have the thunder." Play with illusion cannot be
                    carried further than this except by introducing in the play which the performing
                    audience is witnessing, another play acted before yet another audience. "How
                    extraordinary it is!" says Scävola, the blockhead; "we are an audience, and
                    yonder sit people who are an audience too." The plays are fitted into one
                    another like puzzle-boxes.</p>
                <p>The madness reached its climax when, within this new inmost play, there appears
                    yet another play. It is confusion worse confounded. "Nay, this is too much,"
                    cries Scävola. "Just think of it, good people all! Here we sit as an audience
                    and watch a play; in that play sits another audience watching a third play, and
                    for the actors in that third play yet another play is being acted." And he goes
                    on to explain, like a true Romanticist: "One often has _dreams_ like this, and
                    they are terrible; and thoughts, too, sometimes spin themselves in this fashion
                    ever farther and farther into the heart of things. And both the one and the
                    other are enough to drive a man crazy."</p>
                <p>But the music between the acts contains the key to the whole work. The lively
                    Allegro says: "Do ye indeed know what ye desire, ye who seek for coherence in
                    all things? When the golden wine gleams in the glass and ye are animated by its
                    good spirit, when ye feel doubly full of life and soul, and all the floodgates
                    of your being are opened, what do ye think of then? Can ye order and regulate
                    then? Ye enjoy yourselves and the harmonious confusion." And the Rondo says:
                    "Whenever the philosopher is surprised by a thing, and cannot understand it, he
                    exclaims: 'There is no reason in it.' Nay, when reason penetrates to the heart
                    of itself, when it has investigated its own inmost being and carefully observed
                    itself, it says: 'In this, too, there is no reason.' ... But the man who with
                    reason despises reason, is a reasonable man. Much poetry is prose gone mad, much
                    prose is only crippled poetry; that which lies between poetry and prose is not
                    the best either. O music! whither tend thy steps? Neither is there any reason in
                    thee."</p>
                <p>In his critical writings Tieck himself gives us the clue to his procedure by
                    averring that the aim of Romantic comedy is to lull the spectator into a dreamy
                    mood. "In the midst of a dream," he says, "the soul often does not believe
                    firmly in its visions; but if the dreamer sleeps on, the endless succession of
                    new magic appearances restores the illusion, keeps him in a charmed world, makes
                    him lose the standard of reality, delivers him up at last completely to the
                    dominion of the incomprehensible."</p>
                <p>Music is the formless deep to which the wearied imagination of the Romanticist
                    returns after contemplating itself reflected _ad infinitum_ in its mirror
                    chamber. And the work of art may be likened to one of those carved ivory balls
                    which enclose a whole set of ivory balls, one within the other.</p>
                <p>This style of drama was amusingly parodied by J. L. Heiberg in his witty
                    satirical play, _Julespög og Nytaarslöjer_ ("Christmas Fun and New Year's
                    Drollery"). There is less freedom and originality in Hoffmann's imitation,
                    _Prinzessin Blandina_, in which, in scenes laid behind the scenes, the Stage
                    Manager and the Director discuss the play. The Stage Manager says: "Machinist,
                    give the signal for night." Director: "Why, you are surely not going to have
                    night already? It will disturb the illusion. It is hardly three minutes since
                    Roderick breakfasted in the desert." Stage Manager: "It is the direction given
                    in the book." Director: "Then it is the book that is crazy, and the play is
                    written without the slightest understanding of dramatic art."</p>
                <p>In a different department of literature, in the writings of our Danish
                    philosopher, Kierkegaard, we come upon the mirror chamber with its repeated
                    reflections psychologically applied. As the German Romanticist ironically hovers
                    above his own play, with its Chinese puzzle-box scenes and figures, so the
                    Danish psychologist draws further and further away from his subject by putting
                    one author, as it were, inside another. Listen to his explanation in the
                    _Afsluttende Efterskrift_ ("Concluding Postscript"): "My position is even a more
                    external one than that of any author whose characters are imaginary, but who
                    appears personally in his preface. A prompter, impersonal, or personal in the
                    third degree, I have created authors whose prefaces, nay, whose very names are
                    their own production. In the pseudonymous books there is not a word of my own; I
                    judge them as an uninterested third party, have no knowledge of their meaning
                    except that of the ordinary reader, and not the most remote private connection
                    with them, as is indeed impossible in the case of a doubly reflected
                    communication. A single word from me personally, in my own name, would be a
                    piece of presumptuous self-forgetfulness, and would, from the dialectical point
                    of view, destroy the pseudonymous character of the work. I am no more the
                    publisher, Victor Eremita, than I am the Seducer or the Assessor in
                    _Enten-Eller_; Eremita is the poetically real subjective thinker, whom we meet
                    again in _In Vino Veritas_. In _Frygt og Bæven_ ("Fear and Trembling") I am no
                    more Johannes de Silentio than I am the Knight of Faith whom he depicts; and
                    just as little am I the author of the preface to the book, it being a
                    characteristic utterance of a poetically-real subjective thinker. In that tale
                    of woe, Skyldig?--Ikke Skyldig? ("Guilty or not Guilty?"), I am no more the
                    experimenter than I am the subject of the experiment, since the experimenter is
                    a poetically-real subjective thinker, and the being he experiments on is his
                    psychologically inevitable production. I am a negligeable quantity, i.e. it is
                    immaterial what I am.... I have all along been sensible that my personality was
                    an obstruction which the Pseudonymi must involuntarily and inevitably long to be
                    rid of, or to have made as insignificant as possible, yet which they at the same
                    time, regarding the matter from the ironical and reflective standpoint, must
                    desire to retain as repellant opposition; for I stand to them in the ironically
                    combined relation of secretary and dialectically reduplicated author of the
                    author or authors."</p>
                <p>However different the causes of the reduplication may be in this case, the
                    phenomenon itself is of near kin to the foregoing one. To keep the general
                    public at a distance, to avoid laying bare his heart, and, most important of
                    all, to avoid the tiresome responsibility entailed by speaking in his own name,
                    Kierkegaard places as many authors between himself and the public as possible.
                    Even taking his reasons into consideration, I confess that to me the proceeding
                    seems super-subtle, a sort of reminiscence of the Romantic irony. For although
                    Kierkegaard, as regards his matter, is in many ways ahead of Romanticism, he is
                    still connected with it by his style. It is natural enough that he cannot, or
                    will not, bear the responsibility for what his imaginary characters, the
                    Assessor and the Seducer, say; but it is pure imagination on his part to suppose
                    himself capable of producing his authors at second hand, to suppose, for
                    instance, that he has created the hero in the Engagement Story exactly as Frater
                    Taciturnus would have created him. Several of his would-be authors, Constantin
                    Constantius and Frater Taciturnus, for example, are scarcely to be distinguished
                    from one another, and there is nothing peculiarly characteristic about their
                    productions. The third part of Stadierne ("Stages on the Road of Life") was, as
                    Kierkegaard's own memoranda show, originally intended to form part of
                    _Enten-Eller_. When he remarks (in _Afstuttende Efterskrift_, p. 216) that the
                    most attentive reader will hardly succeed in finding in that work, either in
                    language or turn of thought, a single reminiscence of Enten-Eller, he betrays
                    great capability of self-deception. Both works show in every line that they are
                    written by the same author; in both we come upon the same thoughts, often
                    expressed in almost the same words. The Assessor in _Stadierne_ judges Aladdin
                    exactly as he is judged by the Æsthete in _Enten-Eller_: "What makes Aladdin so
                    great is the strength of his desire."</p>
                <p>Along with all this duplication and reduplication we have in the case of the
                    Romanticists the wildest caprices in the matter of the order of presentation.
                    _The Topsy-turvy World_ begins with the epilogue and ends with the prologue; by
                    such pranks imagination proclaims its independence of all law. Frater Taciturnus
                    records what happened to him last year along with what is happening to him this
                    year; every day at noon he notes down what happened that day a year ago (What a
                    memory!), and at midnight what has occurred during the day. Naturally, it is
                    almost impossible to separate the two threads of event. In Hoffmann's _Kater
                    Murr_, the cat writes its memoirs on sheets of paper which have its master's,
                    Kapellmeister Kreisler's, memoranda on the other side. Both sides of the sheets
                    are printed, the one following the other, so that we read two utterly
                    unconnected manuscripts mixed up with each other, often with interruptions in
                    the middle of sentences or words. Wilfulness, caprice, play with one's own
                    production could scarcely be carried farther. Yet the dissolution of established
                    form did go further, much further. The Romanticists did not rest content with
                    having shattered the conventions of art; they proceeded to decompose the Human
                    personality, and that in many different manners.</p>
                <p>It was Novalis who led the way. In _Heinrich von Ofterdingen_ the hero seems to
                    have a foreknowledge of everything that happens to him. "Each new thing that he
                    saw and heard seemed only to shove back bolts, to open secret doors in his
                    soul." But the strangest impression of all is produced on him by his discovery
                    of a mysterious book in the cave of the hermit Count of Hohenzollern, a book in
                    which, although he is as yet unable to interpret it, he finds the enigma of his
                    existence, an existence beginning before his birth and stretching into the
                    future after his death. Novalis's romance being an allegory and myth, his design
                    being to make a single individual represent the whole eternal story of the soul,
                    he turns to his purpose one of the oldest hypotheses of humanity, the idea that
                    the individual reappears generation after generation. Thus the past and the
                    future take part in the present, in the shape of memory and prophetic intuition.
                    He does not actually believe in the transmigration of souls, but to him, the
                    Romanticist who lives in the contemplation of the eternal, time is of such
                    subordinate significance that, just as he recognises no difference between a
                    natural and a supernatural event, so he sees none between past, present, and
                    future. In this way the individual existence is extended throughout an unlimited
                    period of history.</p>
                <p>In Danish literature we find this Romantic use of the idea of a previous
                    existence in Heiberg's _De Nygifte_. The mother is telling her adopted son about
                    the death of her real son:--</p>
                <p> "Den Morgen, da ban led sin skrækkelige Dom, Endnu var det neppe daget-- Traadte
                    Slutteren ind og sagde: 'Kom! Klokken er nu paa Slaget.'</p>
                <p> "Da sank ban for sidste Gang til mit Bryst Og udbröd: 'Et Ord du mig give, Et
                    kräftigt Ord, som kan vaere min Tröst Paa min sidste Gang i Live!"</p>
                <p> "Og jeg sagde ... Men, Fredrik, du skræmmer mig! sig ... Du rejser dig ... hvad
                    bar du i Sinde? Du stirrer paa mig saa bleg som et Lig ...</p>
                <p> _Fredrik._</p>
                <p> "O Moder! Moder! hold inde!</p>
                <p> Du sagde: 'Naar du for din Frelser staar, Da sig: Min Gud og min Broder, Tilgiv
                    mig for dine Martyrsaar, For min Anger og for min Moder.'</p>
                <p> _Gertrud._</p>
                <p> "Ha! hvoraf ved du det?</p>
                <p> _Fredrik._</p>
                <p> "Mig det var, Forst nu mig selv jeg fatter. Det er din virkelige Sön, du har, Og
                    nu lever han Livet atter."[1]</p>
                <p>Heiberg here makes a beautiful and ingenious use of the idea. But the
                    Romanticists are not content with this. It is not enough for them to transpose
                    the personality into the past, or to deck it with the bright peacock's tail of
                    future existences. They split the Ego into strips, they resolve it into its
                    elements. They scatter it abroad through space, as they stretch it out through
                    time. For the laws of space and time affect them not.</p>
                <p>Self-consciousness is self-duplication. But it is an unhealthy self which cannot
                    overcome and master this selfduplication. This we saw in the case of Lovell and
                    of Roquairol. There is no greater misery than morbid self-contemplation. He who
                    indulges in it separates himself from himself, observes himself from the point
                    of view of a spectator, and ere long experiences the horrible feeling of the
                    prisoner who, when he looks up, sees the eye of the warder at the little glass
                    pane in the door of his cell. His own eye has become quite as terrible to him as
                    another man's. What tends to make this condition permanent is partly the
                    religious and moral feeling that one ought never to lose sight of, but to be
                    always labouring at and improving one's self, and partly natural curiosity
                    regarding the unknown; one looks upon one's self as a country, the coast of
                    which is known, but the interior of which is still to be explored.</p>
                <p>In the case of the man who is healthy in mind and body, this exploration goes on
                    slowly, almost imperceptibly. One fine day the poor prisoner, looking up from
                    his work, finds that the eye has disappeared from the peep-hole. Only now does
                    he begin to breathe, to live. Whether his work be important or unimportant,
                    divine or merely useful, whether he be a Michael Angelo or a cork-cutter, from
                    that moment there is a feeling of balance and unity in his mind; he feels that
                    he is an entire being. In the case of sickly, inactive natures, the eye is never
                    removed from the peep-hole, and a long continuation of this condition leads the
                    individual to the verge of madness. But it is to this very condition that the
                    Romanticists cling. It is this which gives birth to the Romantic idea of the
                    "Doppelgänger,"[2] an idea which finds its first expression in Jean Paul's
                    _Leibgeber-Schoppe_ (in the meditation on Fichte's Ego), and is to be found in
                    almost all Hoffmann's tales, reaching its climax in his chief work, _Die Elixire
                    des Teufels_. It crops up in the writings of all the Romanticists; we have it in
                    Kleist's _Amphitryon_, in Achim von Arnim's _Die beiden Waldemar_, in Chamisso's
                    poem, _Erscheinung_, and Brentano treats it comically in _Die mehreren
                    Wehmüller_. To Hoffmann the Ego is simply a disguise worn on the top of another
                    disguise, and he amuses himself by peeling off these disguises one by one. He
                    carries out what Roquairol only suggested.</p>
                <p>Theodor Hoffmann's life explains the peculiar form which Romantic
                    self-duplication took in his case. He was born in Königsberg in 1776, the son of
                    parents whose inharmonious union was soon dissolved. His mother belonged to a
                    painfully well-regulated and conventional family; his father was as eccentric as
                    he was clever, and had irregular habits which were a great affliction to his
                    wife's relations. Theodor lost his mother early, and the pedantic severity with
                    which his uncle brought him up only made the gifted boy's occasional wild
                    outbursts wilder and madder. He found vent for his feelings in peculiar musical
                    compositions and remarkably clever caricatures. He studied law as a profession,
                    but at the same time devoted much attention to music. At an early age he fell in
                    love with a young married woman. Feeling that the violence of this passion was
                    undermining his reason, he cured himself of it by tearing himself away from his
                    native town, at the age of twenty.</p>
                <p>Soon after this he received a government appointment in Posen. The wild
                    dissipation which prevailed in Poland in those days carried him completely off
                    his feet and materially altered his character. For caricaturing one of his
                    superiors he was removed to Plozk, where he led a more regular life.</p>
                <p>[Illustration: HOFFMANN]</p>
                <p>In 1804 he was transferred to Warsaw, at that time a Prussian town; and it was
                    the full, varied, and, to a German, quite foreign life of this important city
                    which gave Hoffmann's literary tendencies their decisive, final bent. Much that
                    is mad and strange in his writings may be attributed to the wild, reckless
                    joviality of the Warsaw days. In Warsaw he met Zacharias Werner, another author
                    who was distinctly influenced by the social life of Poland in the beginning of
                    the century. And here, whilst conscientiously fulfilling the duties of his
                    appointment, he not only found time to cultivate his favourite art, music, and
                    to frequent the society of other musical devotees, but also managed to decorate
                    several halls with frescoes, to ornament a library with alto-reliefs executed in
                    bronze, and to paint a room in the Egyptian style, adroitly introducing amongst
                    the extraordinary representations of Egyptian gods, caricatures of his
                    acquaintances, whom he provided with tails and wings. It was in Warsaw too that
                    he conducted concerts for the first time.</p>
                <p>In 1806, as every one knows, Prussian rule in Warsaw came to an end. Hoffmann saw
                    the streets of the town crowded, first with the vanguard of the Russian
                    army--Tartars, Cossacks, and Bashkirs--then with Murat's troops, watched the
                    migrations of the races set in motion by Napoleon's campaign, and at last saw
                    Napoleon himself, whom he, the good German, abhorred as a tyrant. In Dresden, in
                    1813, he was eye-witness of several small skirmishes and one battle; he walked
                    over a battlefield, lived through a famine and a species of plague which
                    followed in the train of the war--in short, his imagination was fertilised by
                    all the horrors of the period, the first result being, characteristically
                    enough, merely a set of funny caricatures of the French.</p>
                <p>When still quite a young man, he had married a beautiful Polish lady, who made
                    him a devoted and patient wife; it was probably thanks to her that, in spite of
                    his overstrained nerves, he lived as long as he did. His marriage by no means
                    precluded many passionate attachments to other women, but all these seem to have
                    had their root rather in imagination than in any real feeling. Three days after
                    a young lady with whom he was madly in love had engaged herself to another, he
                    was perfectly happy, having cured himself of his passion by satirising it. He
                    was helped to bear his woe by the pleasure of caricaturing it.</p>
                <p>After figuring as a theatrical architect in Bamberg and conductor of an orchestra
                    in Dresden, he went to Berlin, where he spent the last years of his life as a
                    member of the Kammergericht (one of the principal courts of justice). As was
                    natural, the astonishingly gifted man who could write books, improvise on the
                    piano, compose operas, draw caricatures, and scintillate wit when he was in the
                    humour, became a lion in social circles and a fêted frequenter of the taverns.
                    He devoted a great share of his energy and talent to the observation of his own
                    moods, which he watched closely and described day by day in a kind of diary.</p>
                <p>Wine, which he only regarded as an exciting stimulant, was in reality much more
                    than this to him. To it he owed much of his inspiration, his visions, those
                    hallucinations which at first were fanciful, but became ever more serious. In
                    his case intoxication actually produced a new kind of fantastic poetry. When
                    under the influence of alcohol, he saw the darkness suddenly illuminated by
                    phosphorescent light, or saw a gnome rise through the floor, or saw himself
                    surrounded by spectres and terrible grimacing figures, which went on
                    disappearing and reappearing in all kinds of grotesque disguises.</p>
                <p>It was almost inevitable that this painstaking observer of his own moods and of
                    the external peculiarities, more especially the oddities, of other men, should
                    care little about nature. If he took a walk in summer, it was only to reach some
                    place or other where he would be certain to meet human beings; and he seldom
                    passed a pastry-cook's or a tavern without dropping in to see what kind of
                    people frequented it. This explains the striking want of any feeling for fresh,
                    open-air nature in his books. His mind was at home in a tavern, not in forest
                    solitudes. But if his sense of the beauties of nature was weak, his enthusiasm
                    for art was so much the more intense; genuine Romanticist that he is, half of
                    his productions treat of art.</p>
                <p>The peculiar, Romantic theory of human personality held by a poet of this
                    temperament and this development was a product of over-impressionable and
                    over-strained nerves and of irregular living. In his diary I find the following
                    memoranda:--</p>
                <p>"1804.--Drank Bischof at the new club from 4 to 10. Frightfully agitated in the
                    evening. Nerves excited by the spiced wine. Possessed by thoughts of death and
                    Doppelgänger.</p>
                <p>"1809.--Seized by a strange fancy at the ball on the 6th; I imagine myself
                    looking at my Ego through a kaleidoscope--all the forms moving round me are
                    Egos, and annoy me by what they do and leave undone.</p>
                <p>"1810.--Why do I think so much, sleeping and waking, about madness?"</p>
                <p>It was a settled conviction with Hoffmann that when anything good befalls a man,
                    an evil power is always lurking in the background to paralyse the action of the
                    good power. As he expresses it: "The devil thrusts his tail into everything." He
                    was haunted, says his biographer, Hitzig, by a fear of mysterious horrors, of
                    "Doppelgänger" and spectral apparitions of every kind. He used to look anxiously
                    round while writing about them; and if it was at night, he would often wake his
                    wife and beg her to keep him company till he had finished. He imparted his own
                    fear of ghosts to the characters he created; he drew them "as he himself was
                    drawn in the great book of creation." It does not surprise us to learn that of
                    his own works, he preferred those which contain the most gruesome pictures of
                    madness or the weirdest caricatures--_Brambilla_, for instance.</p>
                <p>He relies for effect, in a manner which soon becomes mannerism, upon the sharp
                    contrasts with which he ushers in his terrific or comical scenes. From the
                    commonest, most prosaic every-day life we are suddenly transported into a
                    perfectly distorted world, where miracles and juggling tricks of every kind so
                    bewilder us that in the end no relation, no species of life, no personality,
                    seems definite and certain. We are always in doubt as to whether we are dealing
                    with a real person, with his spectre, with his essence in another form or other
                    power, or with his fantastic "Doppelgänger."</p>
                <p>In one of the lighter tales of Hoffmann's last period, _Der Doppelgänger_, the
                    two principal characters resemble each other so closely that one is constantly
                    being taken for the other; the one is wounded instead of the other; the
                    betrothed of the one cannot distinguish him from the other, &amp;c., &amp;c. All
                    kinds of absurd mistakes are made possible, and the dread of "Doppelgängerei" is
                    turned to good account. The common-sense explanation of the matter is insisted
                    on (much as it is in Brentano's _Die mehreren Wehmüller_), simply because
                    Hoffmann for once, by way of a change, fancied making some attempt at
                    explanation. The explanation, as a matter of fact, explains nothing. All
                    Hoffmann really cared for was the fantastically gruesome effect, just as all
                    Brentano cared for was the fantastically comical one. _Der Doppelgänger_
                    possesses no artistic merit.</p>
                <p>There is wittier and more audacious invention in the tale, _The Latest Adventures
                    of the Dog Berganza_. In the first place, we are left uncertain whether the dog
                    is a metamorphosed human being or not; he himself says: "It is possible that I
                    am really Montiel, who was punished by being compelled to assume the shape of a
                    dog; if so, the punishment has been a source of pleasure and amusement." In the
                    second place, even the dog, as dog, sees himself duplicated, and is conscious of
                    the dissolution of the unity of his being. "Sometimes I actually saw myself
                    lying in front of myself like another Berganza, another which yet was myself;
                    and I, Berganza, saw another Berganza maltreated by the witches, and growled and
                    barked at him."</p>
                <p>Still greater is the audacity, still more extravagant the whimsicality in the
                    tale of _The Golden Jar_. In it an ugly old Dresden apple-woman is at the same
                    time the beautiful bronze knocker on Registrar Lindhorst's door. The metal face
                    of the door-knocker occasionally wrinkles itself up into the old crone's crabbed
                    smile. In addition to this, she is the odious fortune-teller, Frau Rauerin, and
                    good old Lise, the fond nurse of the young heroine of the tale. She can (like
                    the fortune-teller in _Der Doppelgänger_) suddenly change dress, shape, and
                    features. When the matter of her parentage is cleared up, we learn that her papa
                    was a "shabby feather broom," made of feathers from a dragon's wing, while her
                    mamma was "a miserable beetroot."</p>
                <p>Lindhorst, the stolid Registrar, who never seems to feel at home except when
                    sitting in his library in his flowered dressing-gown, surrounded by old
                    manuscripts, is also a great magician, who, in the middle of an ordinary
                    conversation, suddenly begins to relate the most insane occurrences as if they
                    were the most natural in the world. He tells, for instance, that he was once
                    invisibly present at a party--quite a simple matter--he was in the punch-bowl.
                    On another occasion he takes off his dressing-gown, steps without more ado into
                    a bowl of blazing arrack, vanishes in the flames, and allows himself to be
                    drunk.</p>
                <p>In creating these doubled and trebled existences, the character, for instance, of
                    the Archive Keeper, who is a Registrar by day and a salamander at night,
                    Hoffmann obviously had in his mind the strange contrast between his own official
                    life, as the conscientious criminal judge, severely rejecting all considerations
                    of sentiment or æstheticism, and his free night life as king of the boundless
                    realm of imagination--a life in which reality, as such, had no part.</p>
                <p>But of all Hoffmann's tales, it is _Die Elixire des Teufels_ ("The Elixir of
                    Satan") which makes the most powerful impression. Let us dwell for a moment on
                    the hero of this romance, Brother Medardus; for he is a typical character. It is
                    impossible in a brief summary to convey any idea of the mysterious, weird horror
                    of the book; to feel this one must read it. A work more saturated with
                    voluptuousness and horrors the Romantic School, with all its long practice in
                    the style, never produced.--In a certain monastery is preserved a flask of
                    Satanic elixir, which had belonged to St. Anthony. This elixir is believed to
                    possess magic properties. A monk who has tasted it becomes so eloquent that ere
                    long he is the most famous preacher of the monastery. But his eloquence is not
                    of a pious or healthy, but of a carnal, strangely exciting, dæmonic description.
                    Brother Medardus drinks from the flask. A charming woman, his penitent, falls in
                    love with him, and a longing for the pleasures and delights of the world impels
                    him to leave the monastery. He finds a young man, Count Viktorin, asleep in the
                    forest on the edge of a precipice, and half accidentally pushes him over. From
                    this time onwards every one takes him for the Count.</p>
                <p>"My own Ego, the sport of a cruel accident, was dissolved into strange forms, and
                    floated helplessly away upon the sea of circumstances. I could not find myself
                    again. Viktorin is undoubtedly pushed over the precipice by the accident which
                    directed my hand, not my will--I step into his place." And as though this were
                    not marvellous enough, he adds: "But Reinhold knows Father Medardus, the
                    preacher of the Capuchin Monastery; and thus to him I am what I really am.
                    Nevertheless, I am obliged to take Viktorin's place with the Baroness, for I am
                    Viktorin. I am that which I appear to be, and I do not appear to be that which I
                    am. At strife with my own Ego, I am an unanswerable riddle to myself."</p>
                <p>Medardus, in his own form, now enters into relations with Viktorin's mistress,
                    the Baroness, who has no idea that he is not Viktorin. He is possessed by carnal
                    desires; women fall in love with him; he gives himself up to sensual pleasures,
                    and in order to attain the fulfilment of his wishes, commits crimes of every
                    kind, including murder. Horrible visions haunt him and drive him from place to
                    place. In the end he is denounced and imprisoned. In prison the confusion of
                    individualities reaches a climax. "I could not sleep; in the strange reflections
                    cast by the dull, wavering light of the lamp upon the walls and ceiling, I saw
                    all kinds of distorted faces grinning at me. I put out the lamp and buried my
                    head in my pillow of straw, only to be still more horribly tormented by the
                    hollow groans of the prisoners and the rattling of their chains." It seems to
                    him that he is listening to the death-rattle of his victims. And now he plainly
                    hears a gentle, measured knocking beneath him. "I listened, the knocking
                    continued, and sounds of strange laughter came up through the floor. I sprang up
                    and flung myself upon the straw mattress, but the knocking went on, accompanied
                    by laughter and groans. Presently, an ugly, hoarse, stammering voice began
                    calling gently but persistently: 'Me-dar-dus, Me-dar-dus!' An icy shiver ran
                    through my veins, but I took courage and shouted: 'Who is there? Who is there?'"
                    Then the knocking and stammering begins directly beneath his feet: "He, he, he!
                    He, he, he! Lit-tle brother, lit-tle brother Me-dar-dus ... I am here, am here
                    ... le-let me in ... we will g-g-go into the woo-woo-woods, to the
                    woo-woo-woods." To his horror he seems to recognise his own voice. Some of the
                    flagstones of the floor are pushed up, and his own face, in a monk's cowl,
                    appears. This other Medardus is, like him, imprisoned, has confessed, and is
                    condemned to death. Now everything happens as if in a dream. He no longer knows
                    whether he is really the hero of the events which he believes to have happened,
                    or whether the whole is a vivid dream. "I feel as if I had been listening in a
                    dream to the story of an unfortunate wretch, the plaything of evil powers, who
                    have driven him hither and thither, and urged him on from crime to crime."</p>
                <p>He is acquitted; the happiest moment of his life is at hand; he is to be united
                    to the woman he loves. It is their wedding day. "At that very moment a dull
                    sound rose from the street below; we heard the shouting of hollow voices and the
                    slow rumbling of a heavy vehicle. I ran to the window. In front of the palace, a
                    cart, driven by the headsman's apprentice, was stopping; in it sat the Monk and
                    a Capuchin friar who was praying loudly and fervently with him. Though the Monk
                    was disfigured by fear and by a bristly beard, the features of my terrible
                    Doppelgänger were only too easily recognisable. Just as the cart, which had been
                    stopped for the moment by the throng, rolled on again, he suddenly glared up at
                    me with his horrible glistening eyes, and laughed loud, and yelled: Bridegroom!
                    Bridegroom! Come up on to the housetop! There we will wrestle with one another,
                    and he who throws the other down is king and has the right to drink blood!' I
                    cried: 'You monster! What have I to do with you?' Aurelia flung her arms round
                    me and drew me forcibly away from the window, crying: 'For God and the Holy
                    Virgin's sake!... It is Medardus, my brother Leonard's murderer, whom they are
                    taking to execution.' ... Leonard! Leonard! The spirits of hell awoke within me,
                    and exerted all the power they possess over the wicked, abandoned sinner. I
                    seized Aurelia with such fury that she shook with fear: 'Ha, ha, ha! mad,
                    foolish woman! I, I, your lover, your bridegroom, am Medardus, am your brother's
                    murderer. You, the Monk's bride, would call down vengeance upon him? Ho, ho, ho!
                    I am king--I will drink your blood.'"</p>
                <p>He strikes her to the earth. His hands are covered with her blood. He rushes out
                    into the street, frees the Monk, deals blows right and left with knife and fist,
                    and escapes into the forest. "I had but one thought left, the hunted animal's
                    thought of escape. I rose, but had not taken many steps before a man sprang upon
                    my back and flung his arms round my neck. In vain I tried to shake him off; I
                    flung myself down; I rubbed myself against the trees--all to no purpose--the man
                    only chuckled scornfully. Suddenly the moon shone clear through the dark firs,
                    and the horrible, deathly pale face of the Monk, the supposed Medardus, the
                    Doppelgänger, glared at me with the same appalling glance he had shot at me from
                    the cart. 'He, he, he! little brother! I am w-w-with you still; I'll n-n-never
                    let you go. I can't r-r-run like you. Y-you must carry me. They were go-go-going
                    to break me on the wh-wh-wheel, but I got away.'" This situation is spun out _ad
                    infinitum_, but I forbear. To the end of the book one is uncertain of the real
                    significance of the events, of the ethical tendency of the actions, so
                    completely in this case has imagination disintegrated personality.</p>
                <p>The Scandinavian author, Ingemann, has followed Hoffmann in this path. He turns
                    to account, for instance, the eeriness in the idea of loudly calling one's own
                    name in a churchyard at midnight; see his tale, _The Sphinx_, and others in the
                    so-called Callot-Hoffmann style.</p>
                <p>But, as already observed, Romanticism is not content with stretching out and
                    splitting up the Ego, with spreading it throughout time and space. It dissolves
                    it into its elements, takes from it here, adds to it there, makes it the
                    plaything of free fancy. Here, if anywhere, Romanticism is profound; its
                    psychology is correct, but one-sided; it is always on the night side or on the
                    inevitability of things that it dwells; there is nothing emancipating or
                    elevating about it.</p>
                <p>In the old days the Ego, the soul, the personality, was regarded as a being whose
                    attributes were its so-called capacities and powers. The words "capacity" and
                    "power," however, only signify that there is in me the possibility of certain
                    events, of my seeing, reading, &amp;c. My true being does not consist of
                    possibilities, but of these events themselves, of my actual condition. My real
                    being is a sequence of inward events. For me, my Ego is composed of a long
                    series of mental pictures and ideas. Of this Ego, I constantly, daily, lose some
                    part. Forgetfulness swallows up gigantic pieces of it. Of all the faces I saw on
                    the street yesterday and the day before, of all the sensations which were mine,
                    only one or two remain in my memory. If I go still farther back, only an
                    exceptionally powerful sensation or thought here and there emerges, like a
                    solitary rocky island, from the ocean of forgetfulness. We only keep together
                    the ideas and pictures that remain to us from our past lives by means of the
                    association of these ideas, that is to say, by the aid of the peculiar power
                    they have, in virtue of certain laws, of recalling each other. If we had no
                    numerical system, no dates, no almanacs, wherewith to give some coherence to our
                    different memories, we should have an extremely slight and indistinct idea of
                    our Ego. But however substantial the long inward chain may seem (and it is
                    strengthened, it gains in tenacity, every time we run over its links in our
                    memory), it happens that we at times introduce into it a link which does not
                    belong to it, at times take a link from it and place it in another chain.[3]</p>
                <p>The first of these actions, the introducing of new, incongruous links into the
                    chain of memory, happens in dreams. We dream we have done many things which we
                    have never done. It also happens when we have a false recollection. He who has
                    seen a white sheet blowing about in the dark, and believes he has seen a ghost,
                    has such a false recollection. Most myths and legends, especially religious
                    legends, come into existence in this way.</p>
                <p>It frequently happens, however, that, instead of adding links to the chain of the
                    Ego, we withdraw them. Thus the sick man, when his mind is wandering, supposes
                    that the words he hears are spoken by a strange voice, or endows his inward
                    visions with an outward reality, as Luther did when he saw the devil in his room
                    in the Wartburg; and the madman not only partly, but entirely confuses himself
                    with some one else.</p>
                <p>In a state of reason, then, the Ego is an artificial production, the result of
                    association of ideas. I am certain of my own identity--in the first place,
                    because I associate my name, that sound which I call my name, with the chain of
                    my inward experiences, and secondly, because I keep all the links of this chain
                    connected by the association of ideas, by virtue of which they produce each
                    other. But, since the Ego is thus not an innate but an acquired conception,
                    founded upon an association of ideas which has to maintain itself against the
                    constant attacks of sleep, dreams, imaginations, hallucinations, and mental
                    derangement, it is by its nature exposed to manifold dangers. Just as disease is
                    ever lying in wait for our bodies, so madness lies in wait at the threshold of
                    the Ego, and every now and again we hear it knock.</p>
                <p>It is of this correct psychological theory, originally propounded by Hume, that
                    the Romanticists, though they do not define it scientifically, nevertheless have
                    a presentiment. Dreams, dipsomania, hallucinations, madness, all the powers
                    which disintegrate the Ego, which disconnect its links, are their familiar
                    friends. Read, for instance, Hoffmann's tale, _The Golden Jar_, and you will
                    hear voices issue from the apple-baskets, and the leaves and flowers of the
                    elder-tree sing; you will see the door-knocker make faces, &amp;c., &amp;c. The
                    strange, striking effect is here specially due to the way in which the
                    apparitions suddenly emerge from a background of the most humdrum, ordinary
                    description, from piles of legal documents, or from tureens and goblets. All
                    Hoffmann's characters (like Andersen's Councillor in _The Galoshes of Fortune_,
                    which is an imitation of Hoffmann) are considered by their neighbours to be
                    either drunk or mad, because they always treat their dreams and visions as
                    realities.</p>
                <p>Hoffmann created most of his principal characters in his own image. His whole
                    life resolved itself into moods. We see from his diary how anxiously and
                    minutely he observed these. We come on such entries as: "Romantically religious
                    mood; excitedly humorous mood, leading finally to those thoughts of madness
                    which so often force themselves upon me; humorously discontented, highly-wrought
                    musical, romantic moods; extremely irritable mood, romantic and capricious in
                    the highest degree; strange, excited, but poetic gloominess; very comfortable,
                    brusque, ironical, overstrained, morose, perfectly weak moods; extraordinary,
                    but miserable moods; moods in which I felt deep veneration for myself and
                    praised myself immoderately; _senza entusiasmo, senza esaltazione_, every-day
                    moods," &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
                <p>We seem to see the man's spiritual life spread and split itself up fan-wise into
                    musical high and low spirits. It is easy to guess from this register of moods
                    that Hoffmann, genuine lover of night as he was, was in the habit of going to
                    bed towards morning, after having spent the evening and night in a tavern.</p>
                <p>Romanticism having thus dissolved the Ego, proceeds to form fantastic Egos,
                    adding here, taking away there.</p>
                <p>Take, for an example, Hoffmann's _Klein Zaches_, the little monster who has been
                    endowed by a fairy with the peculiarity "that everything good that others think,
                    say, or do in his presence is attributed to him; the result being that in the
                    society of handsome, refined, intelligent persons he also is taken to be
                    handsome, refined, and cultured--is taken, in short, for a model of every
                    species of perfection with which he comes in contact." When the student reads
                    aloud his charming poems, it is Zaches who is credited with them; when the
                    musician plays or the professor performs his experiments, it is Zaches who gets
                    the honour and the praise. He grows in greatness, becomes an important man, is
                    made Prime Minister, but ends his days by drowning in a toilet-basin. Without
                    overlooking the satiric symbolism of the story, I draw attention to the fact
                    that the author has here amused himself by endowing one personality with
                    qualities properly belonging to others, in other words, by dissolving
                    individuality and disregarding its limits. With the same satirical intention,
                    the same idea is worked out more ingeniously, though more roughly, by Hostrup,
                    the Dane, in his comedy, _En Spurv i Tranedans_ ("A Sparrow among the Cranes" =
                    a dwarf among the giants), in which each one of the other characters attributes
                    to the comical young journeyman tailor the qualities which he himself values
                    most.</p>
                <p>Here we have Romanticism amusing itself by adding qualities to human nature; but
                    it found subtracting them an equally attractive amusement. It deprives the
                    individual of attributes which would seem to form an organic part of it; and by
                    taking these away it divides the human being as lower organisms, worms, for
                    example, are divided into greater and smaller parts, both of which live. It
                    deprives the individual, for instance, of his shadow. In Chamisso's _Peter
                    Schlemihl_, the man in the grey coat kneels down before Peter, and, with
                    admirable dexterity, strips the shadow off him and off the grass, rolls it up
                    and pockets it--and the story shows us the misfortunes which are certain to
                    befall the man who has lost his shadow.</p>
                <p>This same tale of _Peter Schlemihl_ shows how Romanticism, as a spiritual force,
                    succeeded in impressing a uniform stamp on the most heterogeneous talents. It
                    would be difficult to imagine two natures more unlike than Chamisso's and
                    Hoffmann's; hence the plot of Chamisso's tale is as simple and readily
                    comprehensible as the plots of Hoffmann's are morbidly extraordinary.</p>
                <p>Adalbert von Chamisso was a Frenchman born, who acquired the German character
                    remarkably quickly and completely, to the extent even of developing more than
                    one quality which we are accustomed to consider essentially German. The son of a
                    French nobleman, he was born in 1781 in the castle of Boncourt, in Champagne.
                    Driven from France as a boy during the Reign of Terror, he became one of Queen
                    Louisa of Prussia's pages, and later, at the age of twenty, a lieutenant in the
                    Prussian army. He was a serious, almost painfully earnest, but absolutely
                    healthy-minded man of sterling worth, brave and honourable, with a little of the
                    heaviness of the German about him and much of the liveliness of the
                    Frenchman.</p>
                <p>The reverse of Hoffmann, he was no lover of social pleasures, but all the more
                    ardent a lover of nature. He longed on hot summer days to be able to go about
                    naked in his garden with his pipe in his mouth. Modern dress, modern domestic
                    life and social formalities he regarded in the light of burdensome fetters. His
                    love of nature led him to circumnavigate the globe, enamoured him of the South
                    Sea Islands, and is expressed in much of his poetry.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, the imperceptible intellectual compulsion exercised by the age
                    caused him, as author, to adopt Romantic theories and write in the Romantic
                    style. It is characteristic, however, that when in such a poem as _Erscheinung_
                    ("The Apparition") he treats the Romantic idea of the "Doppelgänger," he does it
                    with a certain moral force which leaves on the reader's mind the impression of
                    genuine despair. The narrator comes home at night and sees himself sitting at
                    his desk. "Who are you?" he asks. "Who disturbs me thus?" returns the
                    "Doppelgänger":--</p>
                <p> "Und er: 'So lass uns, wer du seist, erfahren!' Und ich: 'Ein solcher bin ich,
                    der getrachtet Nur einzig nach dem Schönen, Guten, Wahren; Der Opfer nie dem
                    Götzendienst geschlachtet, Und nie gefröhnt dein weltlich-eitlen Brauch,
                    Verkannt, verhöhnt, der Schmerzen nie geachtet: Der irrend zwar und träumend oft
                    den Rauch Für Flamme hielt, doch mutig beim Erwachen Das Rechte nur
                    verfocht:--bist du das auch?' Und er mit wildem kreischend-lautem Lachen: 'Der
                    du dich rühmst zu sein, der bin ich nicht. Gar anders ist's bestellt um meine
                    Sachen. Ich bin ein feiger, lügenhafter Wicht, Ein Heuchler mir und ändern, tief
                    im Herzen Nur Eigennutz, und Trug im Angesicht. Verkannter Edler du mit deinen
                    Schmerzen, Wer kennt sich nun? wer gab das rechte Zeichen? Wer soll, ich oder
                    du, sein Selbst verscherzen? Tritt her, so du es wagst, ich will dir weichen!'
                    Drauf mit Entsetzen ich zu jenem Graus: 'Du bist es, bleib und lass hinweg mich
                    schleichen!' Und schlich zu weinen, in die Nacht hinaus."[4]</p>
                <p>The painful moral self-recognition endows the ghost story with marvellous
                    significance.</p>
                <p>Chamisso's double nationality was a source of much unhappiness to him in his
                    younger days, when there was violent enmity between the land of his birth and
                    his adopted country. In one of his letters to Varnhagen (December 1805) he
                    writes: "'No country, no people--each man for himself!' These words of yours
                    seemed to come straight from my own heart. They almost startled me; I had to
                    wipe away the tears that rolled down my cheeks. Oh! the same sentiment must have
                    made itself felt in all my letters, every one!"</p>
                <p>When, in 1806, Napoleon began the war with Prussia, he issued an order that every
                    Frenchman serving in the enemy's ranks should, when taken prisoner, be tried by
                    court-martial and shot within twenty-four hours. Hence Chamisso, who had in vain
                    demanded to be allowed to resign his commission, was exposed to the chance of a
                    disgraceful death.</p>
                <p>He visited France in the following year, but in Paris there was nothing to
                    attract him. "Wherever I am," he complains, "I am countryless. Land and people
                    are foreign to me; hence I am perpetually longing." He was one of the bravest
                    and most capable of German officers (his behaviour on the occasion of the
                    surrender of Hameln proves this), but, as a Frenchman born and an admirer of
                    Napoleon, he would have preferred not to have taken part in the war against
                    France and the Emperor.</p>
                <p>After his resignation was actually accepted, he spent some time at the court of
                    Madame de Staël, and made the acquaintance of her international circle of
                    friends. The year 1813, the year of Prussia's declaration of war against France,
                    was the most trying of all for the unfortunate young Franco-German. His heart
                    was divided; he desired the fall of Napoleon because he hated despotism, but at
                    the same time he felt every humiliation which befell the French troops during
                    their retreat from Russia, and every insulting word spoken of the Emperor, as if
                    the misfortune had happened, the insult been offered, to himself. And with this
                    very natural feeling his German associates showed no forbearance. He often cried
                    despairingly: "No, the times have no sword for me." "Action and inaction," he
                    writes in May 1813, "are equally painful to me."</p>
                <p>This was the mood which produced his most notable work, _Peter Schlemihl_. The
                    great historical events which harrowed his feelings made him intellectually
                    productive; the summer of 1813 was a turning-point in his life. "I had no longer
                    a country," he says, "or as yet no country." And so the man without a country
                    writes the tale of the man without a shadow. In spite of its intangibility, a
                    man's shadow is, like his country, like his home, one of his natural
                    possessions, a thing which belongs to him from his birth, which is, as it were,
                    part of him. In ordinary circumstances it is regarded as so entirely natural
                    that a man should have a country, that it is hardly reckoned as a special
                    possession, but is, like his shadow, taken as a matter of course. Chamisso gave
                    expression to all his sadness, to the great sorrow of his life, in his daringly
                    imagined fable. And strangely enough, he not only figuratively gave in it the
                    essence of all his past experiences, but also prophetically imaged his future,
                    his voyage round the world and his scientific labours. After Schlemihl has
                    escaped from the temptations of the devil, he accidentally comes into possession
                    of the seven-leagued boots, which take him to every country in the world, and
                    enable him to pursue his favourite study to the greatest advantage. Schlemihl
                    himself says: "My future suddenly showed itself clearly to the eyes of my soul.
                    Banished from human society by the misdemeanours of my youth, I was thrown into
                    the arms of Nature, whom I had always loved. The earth was given to me as a rich
                    garden, study as the directing influence and strength of my life, knowledge as
                    its aim."</p>
                <p>The originality of its plot and the remarkable clearness of its style (this last
                    a characteristic of all Chamisso's writing, and evidently his intellectual
                    inheritance as a Frenchman) made _Peter Schlemihl_ an extraordinary success. It
                    was translated into nearly every language. Ten years after its publication a new
                    kind of lamp, which cast no shadow, was named the Schlemihl lamp.</p>
                <p>Chamisso's success naturally roused Hoffmann to emulation. In the clever little
                    _Story of the Lost Reflection_, the hero leaves his reflection in Italy with the
                    entrancing Giulietta, who has bewitched him, and returns home to his wife
                    without it. His little son, discovering suddenly one day that his father has no
                    reflection, drops the mirror he is holding, and runs weeping from the room. The
                    mother comes in with astonishment and fright written on every feature. "What is
                    this Rasmus has been telling me about you?" she asks. "That I have no
                    reflection, I suppose, my dear," answers Spikher with a forced laugh, and
                    proceeds to try to prove that it is foolish to believe that a man can lose his
                    reflection, but that even if the thing be possible, it is a matter of no
                    importance, seeing that a reflection is simply an illusion. Self-contemplation
                    only leads to vanity, and, moreover, such an image splits up one's personality
                    into truth and imagination.</p>
                <p>Here we have the mirror chamber developed to such a point that the reflections
                    move about independently, instead of following their originals. It is very
                    amusing, very original and fantastic, and, as one is at liberty to understand by
                    the reflection whatever one chooses, it may even be said to be very profound. I
                    express no opinion, but simply draw attention to fact.</p>
                <p>We have seen that the Romanticist is instinctively, inevitably, the enemy of
                    clearly defined form in art. We have seen Hoffmann mixing up the different parts
                    of his book to the extent of having part of one story on the front, part of
                    quite a different one on the back of the same leaf; have seen Tieck composing
                    dramas like so many puzzle balls one within the other, to prevent the reader
                    taking them too _seriously_, and Kierkegaard fitting one author inside another
                    in the Chinese box fashion, on the strength of the theory that truth can only be
                    imparted indirectly, a theory which he ended by treating with scorn--we have
                    seen, in a word, that the artistic standpoint of Romanticism is the exact
                    opposite of the artistic standpoint of the ancients. And when, with their
                    leaning to the supernatural, the Romanticists extend the personality of the
                    individual throughout several successive generations, representing him as living
                    before his birth and after his death, or represent him as a day-dreamer, half
                    visionary and half madman, or humorously endow him with other men's attributes
                    and despoil him of his own, fantastically filching now a shadow, now a
                    reflection, they show by all this fantastic duplication and imagination that
                    their psychological standpoint too, is an absolutely different one; for in the
                    days of old both the work of art and the personality were whole, were of one
                    piece. The movement is a perfectly consistent one, regarded as the antipodes of
                    classicism, in short, as Romanticism.</p>
                <p>But, granted that man is of necessity, by his very nature, a divided, complex
                    being, he is nevertheless, as the healthy, vigorous personality, one. Aim, will,
                    resolve, make him a complete unit. If, as a natural product, the human being is
                    only a group held more or less firmly together by association of ideas, as a
                    mind he is a complete whole; in his will all the elements of the mind are
                    united. Romanticism only understood and depicted human nature with genius from
                    the natural, from the night side. It made no closer approach in this than in any
                    other of its endeavours to intellectual collectedness, unity, and liberty.</p>
                <p>[1] "The morning he suffered his terrible sentence, ere yet it was day, the
                    warder entered and said: 'Come! the hour is about to strike.' Then he fell on my
                    breast for the last time, crying: 'Say a word, a word of power, to strengthen me
                    for the last steps I am to take on earth!' And I said ... But, Fredrik, you
                    frighten me. What is it? Why do you rise and gaze on me thus, pale as a corpse?
                    _Fredrik_--O mother! mother! stop! You said: 'When you stand before your
                    Creator, say: My God and my Brother, forgive me for the sake of Thy passion, of
                    my repentance, and of my mother!' _Gertrud_--Oh, tell how you know this?
                    _Fredrik_--Because it was to me you spoke; not till this moment have I
                    understood myself; I am your own son, now living life over again."</p>

                <p>ROMANTIC SOUL. NOVALIS</p>
                <p>The traveller who visits a mine is let down into a subterranean shaft in company
                    with a man who carries a lamp, by the uncertain light of which they explore the
                    hidden depths. It is on such an expedition that I now invite my readers to
                    accompany me. The shaft to which we are about to descend is that of the German
                    "soul," a mine as deep, as dark, as strange, as rich in precious metal and in
                    worthless refuse as any other. We shall note the imprint received by this soul
                    in the days of Romanticism, for this purpose dwelling at length on the
                    Romanticist who above all others is the poet of the soul--Novalis.</p>
                <p>No word in any other language is the exact equivalent of the German word
                    "Gemüth," here translated "soul." "Gemüth" is something peculiarly German. It is
                    the inward flame, the inward crucible. In the famous words of the "Wanderer's
                    Sturmlied":--</p>
                <p> "Innre Wärme, Seelenwärme, Mittelpunkt! Glüh entgegen Phöb-Apollon, Kalt wird
                    sonst Sein Fürstenblick Ueber dich vorübergleiten,"</p>
                <p>Goethe has described soul, and its significance in the poet's life. With those
                    who have soul, everything tends inwards; soul is the centripetal force of the
                    spiritual life. To the man who sets soul above all else in human life, fervour
                    becomes a patent of nobility. In their conception of soul, as in everything
                    else, the Romanticists rush to extremes. They magnify all that is mysterious,
                    dark, and unexplained in the soul, at the expense of what is clear and
                    beautiful. Goethe is to them the greatest of all poets, not because of his
                    plastic power, but because of the obscurity, the dæmonic mystery, surrounding
                    such characters as the Harper and Mignon, and because of the pregnant intensity
                    of his smaller poems. Lessing and Schiller, on the other hand, are not deemed
                    poets at all, and are sneered at and disparagingly criticised because of the
                    outward direction taken by their keen, energetic thought. For enthusiasm,
                    strength of character, and all such qualities are not soul. Soul remains at home
                    when enthusiasm draws the sword and goes forth to war. To the Romanticists the
                    greatest poet is he who has most soul.</p>
                <p>The change which takes place in the case of the Romanticists is the turning of
                    Goethe's "Seelenwärme"--warmth of soul--into heat, a heat which rises to the
                    boiling or melting point, and in its intensity consumes all established forms
                    and ideas. The glory of the Romantic poet is the heat and passion of the emotion
                    which burns within him. What Novalis does is done with the force of his whole
                    being. Intense, reckless feeling is his motto.</p>
                <p>Friedrich von Hardenberg, a scion of an ancient house, was born at Wiederstedt,
                    in the County of Mansfeld, in May 1772. His father, a man of a vigorous, ardent
                    nature, had, after "leading a very worldly life," been converted at the age of
                    thirty-one, when in great distress because of his first wife's death, to the
                    faith of the English Methodists. At a later period he fell under the influence
                    of the Moravian Brethren, more particularly of Count Zinzendorf; and he was at
                    all times strongly influenced by his elder brother, a bigoted and somewhat
                    ignorant aristocrat of pietistic leanings. The elder brother's will was law in
                    the younger's household after the latter's second marriage; his strict
                    principles forbade the family all social intercourse, and the children were
                    obliged to keep their youthful amusements carefully concealed. In 1787 Novalis's
                    father was appointed director of the saltworks in the little town of
                    Weissenfels.</p>
                <p>[Illustration: NOVALIS]</p>
                <p>Tieck became acquainted with the Hardenberg family in 1799, and they made a
                    profound impression on him. Köpke says: "It was a quiet, serious life that they
                    led, a life of unostentatious but sincere piety. The family belonged to the sect
                    of the Moravian Brethren, and set forth its doctrines in their lives. Old
                    Hardenberg, a high-minded, honourable man, who had been a fine soldier in his
                    day, lived like a patriarch among his talented sons and charming daughters.
                    Change and enlightenment in any form were his detestation; he loved and lauded
                    the good old, misjudged days, and on occasion could express his views very
                    decidedly and defiantly, or blaze up in sudden anger."</p>
                <p>The following little domestic scene speaks for itself: --one day heard the old
                    gentleman fuming and scolding in the adjoining room. "What has happened?" he
                    anxiously asked a servant who entered. "Nothing," was the dry response; "it is
                    only the master giving a Bible lesson." Old Hardenberg was in the habit of
                    conducting the devotional exercises of the family, and at the same time
                    examining the younger children on religious subjects, and this not infrequently
                    meant a domestic storm.</p>
                <p>Such was Friedrich von Hardenberg's home. He was a dreamy, delicate child, an
                    intelligent, ambitious youth. In 1791 he went to Jena to study law. Those were
                    the palmy days of that university, which then numbered amongst its professors
                    such men as Reinhold, Fichte, and Schiller. Novalis found Schiller's lectures
                    specially spirit-stirring, and the poet himself was to the young man "the
                    perfect pattern of humanity." Fichte, whose acquaintance he also made, he
                    enthusiastically called "the legislator of the new world-order." No one at that
                    time could have foreseen in young Hardenberg the future high priest of
                    obscurantism.</p>
                <p>We see him in those youthful days intensely absorbed in the study of his own Ego.
                    His plans are constantly changing; at one time he determines to be the diligent,
                    ardent student, at another to throw up the pursuit of science and be a soldier.
                    Strange as it may sound, the men whom he at this time regards as his models are
                    those friends of freedom who were at the same time apostles of the gospel of
                    utilitarianism. He writes to his brother: "Buy Franklin's autobiography, and let
                    the genius of this book be your guide." We occasionally hear of a little
                    youthful folly; he is now and again in trouble because of debts he has
                    contracted; but he reasons very sensibly with his father, when the latter is
                    inclined to take his peccadilloes too seriously.</p>
                <p>Father and uncle naturally regarded the French Revolution with horror and
                    loathing, but Friedrich and his elder brother were its ardent partisans.</p>
                <p>Things in Saxony being on too small a scale to suit Friedrich's taste, his
                    kinsman, the Prussian Minister (afterwards Chancellor) von Hardenberg, offered
                    him an appointment in Prussia; this, however, he was unable to accept, owing to
                    his father's unwillingness to allow him to become a member of the liberal-minded
                    Berlin cousin's household. He was finally sent to Tennstedt, near Erfurt, to
                    acquire practical experience of the administration of the laws of the Electorate
                    of Saxony under the excellent district magistrate, Just.</p>
                <p>Novalis's first friend among the Romanticists was Friedrich Schlegel, whose
                    acquaintance he made at Jena. The two had much in common, and Novalis at once
                    fell under Schlegel's influence. At the age of twenty-five he writes to him: "To
                    me you have been the high priest of Eleusis; you have revealed heaven and hell
                    to me; through you I have tasted of the tree of knowledge." Young Hardenberg
                    shows himself to be entirely free from political prejudice; he takes a great
                    fancy to Schlegel's landlord, because of the man's "honest republicanism," and
                    jokes at Schlegel's severity in blaming him and the said landlord for their
                    loyalty to the princely house. He has an extremely high opinion of Friedrich
                    Schlegel as a critic, admires the fineness of the meshes of his critical net,
                    which allows no fish, however small, to escape, and calls him "einen
                    dephlogistisirten Lessing."</p>
                <p>When, in 1797, Schlegel visited Hardenberg at his home, he found him utterly
                    broken down. A young girl, Sophie von Kühn, to whom he had been passionately and
                    absorbingly devoted, had just died. His despair took the form of longing for
                    death, and he fully believed that his body must succumb to this desire and to
                    his longing for the departed. Though he had no definite plans of suicide, he
                    called the desire for annihilation by which he was possessed, "a firm
                    determination, which would make of his death a free-will offering." It was under
                    the influence of these thoughts that he wrote his _Hymns to Night_.</p>
                <p>This excess of despair, and also the singular circumstance that Sophie, who died
                    at the age of fifteen, was only twelve years old when he fell in love with her,
                    seem to testify to something unhealthy and abnormal in Novalis's character. The
                    impression is strengthened when we find him, only one year later, betrothed to a
                    daughter of Von Charpentier, superintendent of mines. It is quite true, as La
                    Rochefoucauld says, that the strength of our passions has no relation to their
                    durability; nevertheless it is strange that Hardenberg could suddenly console
                    himself with another, after finding his one pleasure for a whole year in the
                    thought of death, talking for a whole year as if the grave held everything that
                    was dear to him. It was a somewhat lame excuse that Julie seemed to him a
                    reincarnation of Sophie, though the fancy was not a surprising one, considering
                    how much the Romanticists dwelt on the idea of a previous existence. But here,
                    as elsewhere in Hardenberg's life, much that is apparently unnatural is easily
                    explainable when the circumstances are rightly understood. Sophie von Kühn
                    seems, like Auguste Böhmer, to have been a most precocious child. When the youth
                    of twenty-three made her acquaintance, she possessed all the attractions of the
                    child combined with those of the maiden. Her features were fine, her curly head
                    was lightly poised, and there was a whole world in her large, dark, expressive
                    eyes. More impartial judges than Hardenberg have called her "a heavenly
                    creature."</p>
                <p>Sophie's bright, hospitable home presented a striking contrast to young
                    Hardenberg's own; he was fascinated (as was his elder brother) by the whole
                    family; and the young girl, who, had she lived, would perhaps have disappointed
                    him by turning out worldly or insignificant, became his muse, his Beatrice, his
                    ideal. When we remember that, almost at the same time with Sophie, Hardenberg
                    lost his brother Erasmus, to whom he was united by an intimate and beautiful
                    friendship, we cannot think it strange that life should have seemed to him to
                    have lost all its charms. He regarded death not merely in the light of a
                    release; his mystical tendency led him, as already mentioned, to speak of it as
                    "a free-will offering." He wrote in his diary at this time: "My death will be a
                    proof of my understanding and appreciation of what is highest; it will be a real
                    sacrifice, not a flight nor a makeshift." It is at this crisis that he begins to
                    turn in the direction of positive Christianity. Not that he dreamed of declaring
                    allegiance to any particular Church, or belief in any particular set of dogmas,
                    but his pagan longing for death assumed a Christian colouring. His inmost
                    spiritual life had long been of such a nature that, had it not been for the
                    influence of the spirit of the times, he might just as easily have become a
                    determined opponent of all ecclesiastical doctrine. His state of mind seems to
                    have been that indicated by Friedrich Schlegel when he wrote to him a year
                    later: "Possibly you still have the choice, my friend, between being the last
                    Christian, the Brutus of the old religion, or the Christ of the new gospel."
                    Shortly after this his choice was made.</p>
                <p>In December 1798 he still feels, when he compares himself with his friend Just,
                    that he is only the apostle of pure spirituality. He does not, like Just, rely
                    "with childlike mind upon the unalterable words of a mysterious ancient
                    document;" he will not be bound by the letter, and is inclined to find his own
                    way to the primeval world; in the doctrines of Christianity he sees an
                    emblematic pre-figurement of the coming universal religion. "You will not," he
                    writes to Just, "fail to recognise in this conception of religion one of the
                    finest elements in my composition--namely, fancy." In other words, he
                    consciously admits fancy to be at the source of his religious development.</p>
                <p>In the same year (1798) he sent some fragments to Wilhelm Schlegel for
                    publication in the _Athenæum_, with the request that their author might be known
                    as NOVALIS, "which is an old family name, and not altogether unsuitable."</p>
                <p>Tieck met Novalis for the first time when he visited Jena in the summer of 1799.
                    August Wilhelm Schlegel brought them together, and they were soon devoted
                    friends. The three spent the first evening in earnest conversation, opening
                    their hearts to each other At midnight they went out to enjoy the splendour of
                    the summer night. "The full moon," says Köpke, "was shedding a magic glory upon
                    the heights round Jena." Towards morning Tieck and Schlegel accompanied Novalis
                    home. Tieck has commemorated this evening in _Phantasus_.</p>
                <p>It was under Tieck's influence that Novalis wrote his principal work, _Heinrich
                    von Ofterdingen_. While he was still engaged upon it, his young life was put an
                    end to by consumption. He died at the age of twenty-nine, only two years after
                    the meeting with Tieck and A. W. Schlegel above described. This early death, a
                    remarkable degree of originality, and great personal beauty have combined to
                    shed a poetic halo round Novalis. The St. John of the new movement, he resembled
                    the most spiritual of the apostles in outward appearance also. His forehead was
                    almost transparent, and his brown eyes shone with remarkable brilliance. During
                    the last three years of his life it could be read in his face that he was
                    destined to an early death.</p>
                <p>Novalis was seventeen when the French Revolution broke out. If one were asked to
                    give a brief definition of the main idea of that great movement, one would say
                    that it was the destruction of everything that was merely traditional, and the
                    establishment of human existence upon a basis of pure reason, by means of a
                    direct break with everything historic. The thinkers and heroes of the Revolution
                    allow reason, as it were, to upset everything, in order that reason may put
                    everything straight again. Although Novalis is deaf to all the social and
                    political cries of the period, and blind to all its progressive movements, and
                    although he ends in the most grim and repulsive reaction, he is, nevertheless,
                    not merely influenced, but, all unconsciously, completely penetrated by the
                    spirit of his age. Between him--the quiet, introspective, loyal Saxon
                    assessor--and the poor _sans-culottes_ who rushed from Paris to the frontiers,
                    singing the "Marseillaise" and waving the tricolour flag, there is this
                    fundamental resemblance, that they both desire the destruction of the whole
                    outward and the construction of an inward world. Only, their inward world is
                    reason, his is soul: for them, reason with its demands and formulæ--liberty,
                    equality, and fraternity; for him, the soul, with its strange nocturnal gloom,
                    in which he melts down everything, to find, at the bottom of the crucible, as
                    the gold of the soul--night, disease, mysticism, and voluptuousness.[1]</p>
                <p>Thus, in spite of his violent animosity to his age, Novalis belongs to it; the
                    direct opponent of all its enlightened and beautiful ideas, he is, despite
                    himself, possessed by its spirit.</p>
                <p>What in Fichte and the men of the Revolution is clear reason, comprehending and
                    testing everything, is in Novalis an all-absorbing self--perception, which
                    becomes actual voluptuousness; for the new spirit has taken such a hold upon him
                    that it is, as it were, entwined round his nerves, causing a species of
                    voluptuous excitement. What with them is abstract liberty, liberty to begin
                    everything from the beginning again, with him is lawless fancy, which changes
                    everything, which resolves nature and history into emblems and myths, in order
                    to be able to play at will with all that is external, and to revel
                    unrestrainedly in self-perception. As Arnold Ruge puts it: "Mysticism, which is
                    theoretical voluptuousness, and voluptuousness, which is practical mysticism,
                    are present in Novalis in equally strong proportions."</p>
                <p>Novalis is himself thoroughly conscious that, in spite of all its would-be
                    spirituality, his hectic imagination inclines towards the sensual. Writing to
                    Caroline Schlegel on the subject of _Lucinde_, he says: "I know that imagination
                    (Fantasie) is most attracted by what is most immoral, most animal; but I also
                    know how like a dream all imagination is, how it loves night, meaninglessness,
                    and solitude." He here affirms of imagination in general what applied
                    particularly to his own.</p>
                <p>Tieck writes with enthusiasm of music, as teaching us to _feel feeling_. Novalis
                    is a living interpretation of these words. He, whose aim is feeling,
                    unrestrained, irresponsible feeling, desires to feel himself, and makes no
                    secret of the fact that he seeks this self-enjoyment. Therefore to him sickness
                    is preferable to health. For the sick man perpetually feels his own body, which
                    the healthy man does not. Pascal, and our own Kierkegaard, contented themselves
                    with defining sickness as the Christian's natural condition. Novalis goes much
                    further. To him the highest, the only true life, is the life of the sick man.
                    "_Leben ist eine Krankheit des Geistes_" ("Life is a disease of the spirit").
                    Why? Because only in living individuals does the world-spirit feel itself,
                    attain to self-consciousness. And no less highly than disease does Novalis prize
                    voluptuousness, sensual rapture. Why? Because it is simply an excited, and
                    therefore in his eyes diseased, self-consciousness, a wavering struggle between
                    pleasure and pain. "Could man," he says, "but begin to love sickness and
                    suffering, he would perhaps in their arms experience the most delicious rapture,
                    and feel the thrill of the highest positive pleasure.... Does not all that is
                    best begin as illness? Half-illness is an evil; real illness is a pleasure, and
                    one of the highest." And he writes elsewhere of a mystic power, "which seems to
                    be the power of pleasure and pain, the enrapturing effect of which we observe so
                    distinctly in the sensations of voluptuousness." To Novalis's voluptuous feeling
                    of sickness corresponds the pietist's conviction of sin, that spiritual sickness
                    which is at the same time a voluptuous pleasure. Novalis himself is perfectly
                    aware of this correspondence. He says: "The Christian religion is the most
                    voluptuous of religions. Sin is the greatest stimulant to love of the Divine
                    Being; the more sinful a man feels himself to be, the more Christian he is.
                    Direct union with the Deity is the aim of sin and of love." And again: "It is
                    curious that the evident association between sensuality, religion, and cruelty
                    did not long ago draw men's attention to their close kinship and common
                    tendencies."</p>
                <p>And just as Novalis now prefers sickness to health, so he prefers night to day,
                    with its "impudent light."</p>
                <p>Aversion for day and daylight was general among the Romanticists. I drew
                    attention to it in _William Lovell_. Novalis simply gives expression to a
                    heightened degree of the general feeling in his famous _Hymns to Night_. That he
                    should love the night is easy to understand. By hiding the surrounding world
                    from it, night drives the Ego in upon itself; hence the feeling of night, and
                    self-consciousness, are one and the same thing. The rapture of the feeling of
                    night lies in its terror; first comes the fear of the individual, when
                    everything round him disappears in the darkness, that he will himself disappear
                    from himself; then comes the pleasant shudder when, out of this fear,
                    self-consciousness emerges stronger than before.</p>
                <p>In one of his fragments Novalis calls death a bridal night, a sweet mystery, and
                    adds:--</p>
                <p> "Ist es nicht klug, für die Nacht ein geselliges Lager zu suchen? Darum ist
                    klüglich gesinnt, wer auch Entschlummerte liebt."[2]</p>
                <p>So completely is this idea incorporated in the Romantic philosophy of life, that
                    in Werner's drama, _Die Kreuzesbrüder_, the hero, immediately before he is led
                    to the stake, says:--</p>
                <p> "Den Neid verzeih' ich, Die Trauer nicht.--O unaussprechlich schwelg' ich In der
                    Verwandlung Wonn', in dem Gefühl Des schönen Opfertodes!--O mein Bruder! Nicht
                    wahr? es kommt die Zeit, we alle Menschen Den Tod erkennen--freudig ihn umarmen,
                    Und fühlen werden, dass dies Leben nur Der Liebe Ahnung ist, der Tod ihr
                    Brautkuss, Und sie, die mit der Inbrunst eines Gatten, Im Brautgemach, uns vom
                    Gewand entkleidet-- Verwesung, Gluterguss der Liebe ist!"[3]</p>
                <p>Life and death are to Novalis only "relative ideas." The dead are half alive, the
                    living half dead. It is this thought which in his case first gives zest to
                    existence. In the first of his Hymns to Night he writes: "I turn to thee, holy,
                    ineffable, mysterious Night! Far off lies the world, as if it had sunk into a
                    deep grave; deserted and lonely is its place. My heart-strings vibrate with
                    sorrow.... Dost thou find pleasure in us as we in thee, dark Night?... Costly
                    balsam drips from thy hand, from thy poppy-sheaf. Thou unfoldest the heavy wings
                    of the soul.... How poor, how childish seems the day, how joyful and blessed its
                    departing!... More heavenly than those sparkling stars are the myriad eyes which
                    Night opens in us. They see farther than the palest of those countless hosts;
                    without the aid of light, they see into the depths of a loving soul, and its
                    high places are filled with unspeakable rapture. Praised be the Queen of the
                    earth, the august revealer of holy worlds, the guardian of blessed love! She
                    sends me thee, my beloved, sweet sun of the night. Now I wake, for I am thine
                    and mine. Thou hast proclaimed to me the life-giving gospel of Night, hast made
                    of me a human being. Consume my body with the glowing flame of the spirit, that
                    I may mingle yet more ethereally, yet more closely with thee, and the
                    bridal-night be eternal."</p>
                <p>One feels the feverish desire of the consumptive in this outburst. The parallel
                    passage in _Lucinde_ is: "O infinite longing! But a time is coming when the
                    fruitless desire and vain delusions of the day will die away and disappear, and
                    the great night of love bring eternal peace." The thoughts of these two Romantic
                    lovers of the night meet in this idea of an eternal embrace.</p>
                <p>In this enthusiasm for night lies the germ of religious mysticism. In the case of
                    Justinus Kerner (which recalls that of Jung Stilling), bias towards the
                    mysterious becomes belief in apparitions and fear of spirits. In certain of the
                    writings of the later Romanticists, for instance in Achim von Arnim's _Die
                    schöne Isabella von Ægypten_, half the characters are spirits. Mysticism is a
                    fundamental element in the art of Clemens Brentano, even when he is at his best,
                    and it gives charm and colour to his descriptions.</p>
                <p>Novalis himself describes mysticism as voluptuousness--"ein wollüstiges Wesen."
                    To understand this expression aright, we must study his hymns:--</p>
                <p> "Hinüber wall' ich Und jede Pein Wird einst ein Stachel Der Wollust sein. Noch
                    wenig Zeiten So bin ich los, Und liege trunken Der Lieb' im Schoss."[4]</p>
                <p>Still plainer expression is given to the ecstatic passion of the sensual Ego in a
                    sacramental hymn (No. vii. of the _Spiritual Songs_): "Few know the secret of
                    love, feel for ever unsatisfied, for ever athirst. The divine significance of
                    the sacrament of the Lord's Supper is an enigma to the carnal mind. But he who
                    even once has drunk in the breath of life from warm, beloved lips, whose heart
                    has melted in the quivering flames of holy fire, whose eyes have been opened to
                    fathom the unfathomable depths of heaven--he will eat of His body and drink of
                    His blood for ever more. Who has yet discerned the transcendent meaning of the
                    earthly body? Who can say that he understands the blood? The day is coming when
                    all body will be one body; then the beatified pair will float in heavenly blood.
                    Oh! that the ocean were already reddening, that the rocks were softening into
                    fragrant flesh! The sweet repast never ends, love is never satisfied. Never can
                    it have the beloved near enough, close enough to its inmost self. By lips that
                    are ever more tenderly amorous, the heavenly nutriment is ever more eagerly
                    seized and transformed. Hotter and hotter burns the passion of the soul,
                    thirstier, ever thirstier grows the heart; and so the feast of love endures from
                    everlasting to everlasting. Had those who abstain but once tasted of it, they
                    would forsake everything and seat themselves beside us at the table of longing,
                    which is ever furnished with guests. They would comprehend the infinite fulness
                    of love, and extol our feast of the Body and the Blood."[5]</p>
                <p>These lines give us an excellent idea of the nature and main characteristics of
                    mysticism. Mysticism retains all the old religious forms, but it truly _feels_
                    their significance; it speaks the same language as orthodoxy, but it changes a
                    dead language into a living one. Herein lay the secret of its victory in the
                    Middle Ages over that dry, formal scholasticism which it consumed in its glow.
                    This made it the precursor of the Reformation. The mystic needs no external
                    dogma; in his pious rapture he is his own priest. But, as his spiritual life is
                    altogether an inward life, he does not abolish external dogma, and in the end
                    actually becomes a sacerdotalist.</p>
                <p>In mystically prophetic words Novalis foretells the coming of the new kingdom of
                    sacred darkness:--</p>
                <p> "Es bricht die neue Welt herein _Und verdunkelt den hellsten Sonnenschein_. Man
                    sieht nun aus bemoosten Trümmern Eine wunderseltsame Zukunft schimmern, Und was
                    vordem alltäglich war, Scheint jetzo fremd und wunderbar. Der Liebe Reich ist
                    aufgethan, Die Fabel fängt zu spinnen an. Das Urspiel jeder Natur beginnt, Auf
                    kräftige Worte jedes sinnt, Und so das grosse Weltgemüth Ueberall sich regt und
                    unendlich blüht. * * * * * * * * * * Die Welt wird Traum, der Traum wird Welt,
                    Und was man glaubt, es sei geschehn, Kann mann von weitem erst kommen sehn; Frei
                    soll die Phantasie erst schalten, Nach ihrem Gefallen die Fäden verweben, Hier
                    manches verschleiern, dort manches entfalten, _Und endlich in magischem Dunst
                    verschweben_. _Wehmuth und Wollust, Tod und Leben Sind hier in innigster
                    Sympathie,_-- Wer sich der höchsten Lieb' ergeben, Genest von ihren Wunden
                    nie."[6]</p>
                <p>Night, death, sensual rapture, heavenly bliss--these ideas are still more firmly
                    interwoven in the verses above the churchyard gate, in _Heinrich von
                    Ofterdingen_. The dead say:--</p>
                <p> "Süsser Reiz der Mitternächte, Stiller Kreis geheimer Mächte, Wollust
                    räthselhafter Spiele, Wir nur kennen euch. * * * * * * * * Leiser Wünsche süsses
                    Plaudern Hören wir allein, und schauen Immerdar in sel'ge Augen, Schmecken
                    nichts als Mund und Kuss. Alles was wir nur berühren, Wird zu heissen
                    Balsamfrüchten, Wird zu weichen zarten Brüsten, Opfern kühner Lust.</p>
                <p> Immer wächst und blüht Verlangen Am Geliebten festzuhangen, Ihn im Innern zu
                    empfangen, Eins mit ihm zu sein. Seinem Durste nicht zu wehren, Sich im Wechsel
                    zu verzehren, Von einander sich zu nähren, Von einander nur allein.</p>
                <p> So in Lieb' und hoher Wollust Sind wir immerdar versunken, Seit der wilde trübe
                    Funken Jener Welt erlosch;</p>
                <p> Seit der Hügel sich geschlossen Und der Scheiterhaufen sprühte, Und dem
                    schauernden Gemüthe Nun das Erdgesicht zerfloss."[7]</p>
                <p>This mysticism, which deems the dead happy because it supposes them to be
                    revelling in all sensual delights, becomes, in its practical application, a sort
                    of quietism, that is, preference for a vegetating, plant-like life, the life
                    extolled in _Lucinde_.</p>
                <p>"The plants," says Novalis, "are the plainest speech of the earth; every new
                    leaf, every remarkable flower is some mystery which is trying to reveal itself,
                    and which remains motionless and dumb only because from very joy and love it can
                    neither move nor speak. If one chances in solitude upon such a flower, does not
                    everything around it seem transfigured? do not the little feathered songsters
                    seem to seek its vicinity? One could weep for gladness, and, forgetting the
                    world, could bury one's hands and feet in the ground, take root, and never leave
                    that happy neighbourhood."</p>
                <p>What an overdose of sentiment! It provides its own cruel parody in the insane
                    situation which reminds us Danes of one in Holberg's _Ulysses von Ithacia_.</p>
                <p>In another part of _Ofterdingen_ we read: "Flowers exactly correspond to children
                    ... like children they are found lowest down, nearest the earth; the clouds,
                    again, are possibly revelations of the second, higher childhood, of Paradise
                    regained; therefore it is that they shed such refreshing dews upon the children
                    of earth." In the Romantic jargon there is even talk of the childlikeness of
                    clouds. Naïveté aspires, and is not satisfied until it has reached the sky. O
                    Polonius!--These naïve clouds are the true, the proper symbols of
                    Romanticism.</p>
                <p>But even in the plants and the clouds there is still too much endeavour and
                    unrest to satisfy the Romantic soul. Even vegetation is not perfect abstraction,
                    perfect quiescence; there is tendency upwards in the straining of the plant
                    towards the light. Therefore even the plant life is not the highest. Novalis
                    goes a step further than Friedrich Schlegel.</p>
                <p>"The highest life is mathematics. Without enthusiasm no mathematics. The life of
                    the gods is mathematics. Pure mathematics is religion. It is arrived at only by
                    revelation. The mathematician knows everything. All activity ceases when
                    knowledge is attained. The state of knowledge is bliss (Eudämonie), rapturous
                    peace of contemplation, heavenly abstraction."</p>
                <p>Now we have reached the climax. All life is crystallised into dead mathematical
                    figures.</p>
                <p>At this point the life of the soul is condensed to such a degree that it comes to
                    a standstill. It is as if the clock of the soul had ceased to strike. Every
                    noble aspiration, every tendency towards independent action is forced back and
                    stifled in the airless vaults of the soul.</p>
                <p>It is at this point, therefore, that intense spirituality turns into gross
                    materialism. When all capacity of producing new outward forms is not only
                    despised, but actually destroyed, we have reached the turning-point, the point
                    at which all established outward forms are recognised and accepted, and accepted
                    the more gladly the more rigid they are, the closer they approach to
                    crystallised petrifaction, the more certain it is that they only leave room for
                    the life of vegetation. The step is taken by Novalis in a remarkable essay,
                    _Christendom in Europe_, which Tieck by his erasures vainly tried to nullify,
                    and which Friedrich Schlegel, by leaving out one most important passage,
                    converted into a defence of Catholicism.</p>
                <p>In this essay he writes as follows:--"These were happy, glorious days, when
                    Europe was still a Christian continent, the home of the one, undivided Christian
                    religion.... The wise head of the Church rightly set himself against the bold
                    cultivation of the human mind at the cost of religious faith, and against
                    untimely and dangerous discoveries in the domain of science. Thus he forbade the
                    scientists to maintain openly that this earth is an insignificant planet, for he
                    knew well that men would lose, along with their respect for their earthly home,
                    respect for their heavenly home and their fellow-men, that they would choose
                    limited knowledge in preference to unlimited faith, and would acquire the habit
                    of despising everything great and wonderful, as being simply the result of
                    lifeless law."</p>
                <p>We could almost suppose ourselves to be listening to the sermonising of a
                    parish-clerk of the eighteenth century. And yet we are sensible of the poet's
                    consistency. Poetry, which led Schiller back to Greece, leads Novalis back to
                    the Inquisition, and induces him, like Joseph de Maistre, to side with it
                    against Galileo.</p>
                <p>Of Protestantism he says: "This great spiritual disruption, which was accompanied
                    by disastrous wars, was a notable proof of the harmfulness of knowledge, of
                    culture--or at least of the temporary harmfulness of a certain degree of
                    culture.... The schismatics separated the inseparable, divided the indivisible
                    Church, and presumptuously dissociated themselves from the great Christian
                    communion, in which, and through which alone, true, lasting regeneration was
                    possible.... A religious peace was concluded, based upon principles which were
                    as foolish as they were irreligious; for the continued existence of so-called
                    Protestantism was equivalent to the establishment of a self-contradiction,
                    namely, permanent revolutionary government.... Luther treated Christianity
                    arbitrarily, mistook its spirit, and introduced a new letter, a totally new
                    doctrine, that of the sacred and supreme authority of the Bible. This,
                    unfortunately, meant the interference in religious matters of a perfectly
                    foreign, entirely earthly science, namely, philology, the destructive influence
                    of which is thenceforward unmistakable.... The popularisation of the Bible was
                    now insisted upon, and its contemptible matter and the crude abstract sketch of
                    a religion provided by its books had a remarkable effect in frustrating the
                    inspiring, revealing activity of the Holy Spirit.... The Reformation was the
                    death-blow of Christianity.... Fortunately for the Church, there came into
                    existence at this time a new religious order, on which the expiring spirit of
                    the hierarchy seemed to have bestowed its last gifts. This order gave new life
                    to the old forms, and with wonderful intuition and determination set about the
                    restoration of the Papal power. Never before in the world's history had such a
                    society been known.... The Jesuits were well aware how much Luther owed to his
                    demagogic arts and his knowledge of the common people.... From of old, the
                    scholar has been the instinctive enemy of the priest; the learned and the
                    ecclesiastical professions must carry on a war of extermination against each
                    other so long as they are separated; for they are struggling for the same
                    position.... To the outcome of modern thought men gave the name of philosophy;
                    and under philosophy they comprehended everything that was hostile to the old
                    order of things, consequently every attack upon religion. What was at first
                    personal hatred of the Roman Catholic Church became by degrees hatred of the
                    Bible, of the Christian faith, indeed of all religion."</p>
                <p>We see how clearly Novalis understood that free-thought was a consequence of
                    Protestantism. He continues:--</p>
                <p>"Nay, more; the hatred of religion developed naturally and inevitably into a
                    hatred of all enthusiasms, denounced imagination and feeling, morality and love
                    of art, the past and the future, barely acknowledged man to be the highest among
                    the animals, and reduced the creative music of the universe to the monotonous
                    whirr of an enormous mill, driven by the stream of chance--a mill without a
                    builder or miller, a true _perpetuum mobile_.... One enthusiasm was
                    magnanimously left to mankind, enthusiasm for this glorious philosophy and its
                    priests. France had the good fortune to be the seat of this new faith, which was
                    patched together out of fragments of knowledge.... On account of its obedience
                    to the laws of mathematics and its audacity, light was the idol of these men....
                    The history of modern unbelief is very remarkable, and is the key to all the
                    monstrous phenomena of these later days. It only begins in this century, is
                    little noticeable till the middle of it, and then quickly develops with
                    incalculable force in every direction; a second, more comprehensive and more
                    remarkable Reformation was inevitable, and of necessity came first in the
                    country which was most modernised and had suffered longest from want of
                    freedom.... During this anarchy religion was born again, true anarchy being its
                    generating element.... To the reflective observer the overthrower of the state
                    is a Sisyphus. No sooner does he reach the summit, where there is equipoise,
                    than the mighty burden rolls down on the other side. It will never remain up
                    there unless it is kept in position by an attraction towards heaven. All your
                    supports are too weak as long as your state has a tendency towards the
                    earth."</p>
                <p>He enthusiastically predicts the coming age of "soul." "In Germany we can already
                    point to sure indications of a new world.... Here and there, and often in daring
                    union, are to be found incomparable versatility, brilliant polish, extensive
                    knowledge, and rich and powerful imagination. A strong feeling of the creative
                    arbitrariness, the boundlessness, the infinite many-sidedness, the sacred
                    originality, and the unlimited capacity of the human spirit is taking possession
                    of men.... Although these are only indications, disconnected and crude, they
                    nevertheless discover to the historic eye a universal individuality, new
                    history, a new humanity, the sweet embrace of a loving God and a young,
                    surprised Church, and the conception of a new Messiah in the hearts of all the
                    many thousands of that Church's members. Who does not, with sweet shame, feel
                    himself pregnant? The child will be the express image of the father--a new
                    golden age, with dark, fathomless eyes; a prophetic, miracle-working, comforting
                    age, which will kindle the flame of eternal life; a great reconciler, a saviour
                    who, like a spirit taking up his abode amongst men, will only be believed in,
                    not seen, will appear to the faithful in innumerable forms, will be consumed as
                    bread and wine, embraced as the beloved, inhaled as the air, heard as word and
                    song, received as death with voluptuous ecstasy and love's keenest pain, into
                    the inmost recesses of the dissolving body."</p>
                <p>After occupying ourselves so long with voluptuous rapture, bliss, religion,
                    night, and death, do we not instinctively cry: "Air! light!" We seem to be
                    suffocating. This "soul" in truth resembles the shaft of a mine. Novalis's love
                    for the miner's life, in which smoky red lanterns replace the light of day, is
                    not without significance. And what is the upshot of it all? What new being is
                    the result of the embraces of a loving God and a young, surprised Church? What
                    but a regenerated reaction, which in France restored Catholicism and (after
                    Napoleon's fall) the Bourbons, and in Germany led to that hateful tyranny which
                    gave pietism the same power there that Catholicism exercised in France, cast
                    young men into prison, and drove the best writers of the day into exile.</p>
                <p>Novalis relegated everything to the inner life, the inner world. It engulfed
                    everything, the forces of the Revolution and of the counter-revolution; in it
                    all the lions of the spirit lay bound; in it the Titanic powers of history were
                    shut up and hypnotised. Night surrounded them; they felt the voluptuous joys of
                    darkness and death; the life they lived was the life of a plant, and in the end
                    they turned into stone. In the inner world lay all the wealth of the spirit, but
                    it was dead treasure, inert masses, ingeniously crystallized according to
                    mathematical laws. It was like the gold and silver in the inward parts of the
                    earth, and the poet was the miner who was spirited down into the depths and
                    rejoiced in all that he saw.</p>
                <p>But while he stayed down below, things in the upper world pursued their usual
                    course. The outer world was not in the least disturbed because the poet and the
                    philosopher were employed in taking it to pieces in the inner world. For they
                    did not go to work in the rough, material fashion of a Mirabeau or a Bonaparte;
                    they only disintegrated it inwardly in an inner world. When the poet, released
                    by the spirits, came up from the mine again, he found the outer world, which he
                    supposed he had resolved into its elements, exactly as it had been before. All
                    that he had melted in his heart stood there, hard and cold; and, since the outer
                    world had never really interested him, and since it seemed to him almost as
                    night-like, murky, and drowsy as his inner world, he gave it his blessing and
                    let it stand.</p>
                <p>The prophetic quality in Novalis, his peculiar type of personal beauty, his
                    genuine lyric talent, and his early death, have led critics to compare him with
                    Shelley, who was born twenty years after him. Quite lately, in the _Revue des
                    Deux Mondes_, Blaze de Bury drew attention to the resemblance. He writes:
                    "Shelley's poetry has a strong resemblance to Novalis's, and the likeness
                    between these two singular poets is not only a physical one; common to them both
                    are close observation of nature, divination of all her little secrets, a choice
                    combination of sentiment with philosophical thought, an utter want of
                    tangibility, reflections, but no body, a mounting upwards, an aspiration, that
                    leads nowhere."</p>
                <p>These resemblances, however, do not affect the great fundamental unlikeness, the
                    diametrically opposed spiritual standpoints of these two poets of such an
                    apparently similar cast of mind, one of whom lives before, the other after the
                    great spiritual revulsion of the beginning of this century.</p>
                <p>Think of Shelley's life in its main outlines. The son of a good family, he was
                    sent to an aristocratic school, where, while yet a child, he was roused to wrath
                    and opposition by the brutality of the boys and the cruelty of the masters. What
                    especially kindled his indignation as he grew older was the hypocrisy with which
                    those who gave free rein to their bad passions perpetually talked of God and
                    Christianity. During his second year at Oxford, Shelley wrote an essay _On the
                    Necessity of Atheism_, of which, with naïve straightforwardness, he sent copies
                    to the Church and University authorities. He was summoned before them, and, on
                    refusing to retract what he had written, was expelled for atheism. He went home,
                    but his father received him with such contemptuous coldness that he soon left
                    again, never to return. His whole life was a tissue of similar rebellions and
                    similar misfortunes. In his twentieth year he was threatened with consumption,
                    and though he recovered, he was thenceforward a delicate, nervously irritable
                    man. The Court of Chancery refused him the guardianship of his own children
                    (after the death of his first wife) on the ground that he had propagated immoral
                    and irreligious doctrines in _Queen Mab_. After this he left England for ever,
                    and lived in Italy in voluntary exile until sudden death put an end to his sad
                    and homeless existence. His boat was capsized in a squall in the Gulf of
                    Spezzia, and he was drowned, at the age of twenty-nine.</p>
                <p>In contrast with such a life as this, Hardenberg's is a true German country-town
                    idyll. At the age of twenty-five he received a Government appointment, an
                    auditorship at one of the state saltworks, and a year or two later he was
                    advanced to be "assessor" at the saltworks of Weissenfels. His Romanticism in no
                    way interfered with his fulfilment of his duties as a good citizen. In his
                    capacity of Government official he was zealous, conscientious, and steady--one
                    of the men who do their duty and are guilty of no extravagances, and whose
                    position is consequently assured. His republicanism was short-lived, and he is
                    only saved by his naïveté from the charge of servility. He calls Frederick
                    William and Louisa of Prussia "ein klassisches Menschenpaar;" in the revelation
                    of these "geniuses" he sees an omen of a better world. Frederick William is, he
                    says, the first king of Prussia; he crowns himself every day. A real
                    "transubstantiation" has taken place; for the court has been transformed into a
                    family, the throne into a sanctuary, a royal marriage into an eternal union of
                    hearts. Only youthful prejudice, he maintains, inclines to a republic; the
                    married man desires order, safety, quietness, a well-regulated household, a
                    "real monarchy." "A constitution has for us only the interest of a dead letter.
                    How different is the law which is the expression of the will of a beloved and
                    revered person! We have no right to conceive of the monarch as the first officer
                    of the state; he is not a citizen, and cannot therefore be an official. The king
                    is a human being exalted to the position of an earthly providence."</p>
                <p>If we compare such utterances as the above with those of Shelley's poems which
                    were inspired by the tyranny prevailing in his native country, or those in which
                    he glorifies the Italian revolutions and the Greek war of liberation, we have
                    the sharpest imaginable contrast. And the same contrast meets us wherever we
                    turn. Novalis sings the praises of sickness. Shelley says: "It is certain that
                    wisdom is not compatible with disease, and that, in the present state of the
                    climates of this earth, health, in the true and comprehensive sense of the word,
                    is out of the reach of civilized man."</p>
                <p>Novalis says: "We picture God to ourselves as a person, just as we think of
                    ourselves as persons. God is exactly as personal and individual as we are."
                    Shelley says: "There is no God! This negation must be understood solely to
                    affect a creative Deity. The hypothesis of a pervading Spirit, co-eternal with
                    the universe, remains unshaken.... It is impossible to believe that the Spirit
                    which pervades this infinite machine begat a son upon the body of a Jewish
                    woman, or is angered by the consequences of that necessity which is a synonym of
                    itself. All that miserable tale of the Devil, and Eve, and an Intercessor, with
                    the childish mummeries of the God of the Jews, is irreconcilable with the
                    knowledge of the stars. The works of his fingers have borne witness against
                    him."</p>
                <p>Novalis sings the praises of the priesthood and of the Jesuits. Shelley says:
                    "During many ages of darkness and misery this story" (the doctrine of the Bible)
                    "gained implicit belief; but at length men arose who suspected it was a fable
                    and imposture, and that Jesus Christ, so far from being a God, was only a man
                    like themselves. But a numerous set of men who derived, and still derive,
                    immense emoluments from this opinion, told the vulgar that if they did not
                    believe in the Bible they would be damned to all eternity; and burned,
                    imprisoned, and poisoned all the unbiassed and unconnected inquirers who
                    occasionally arose. They still oppress them, so far as the people, now become
                    more enlightened, will allow.... The same means that have supported every
                    popular belief have supported Christianity. War, imprisonment, assassination,
                    and falsehood, deeds of unexampled and incomparable atrocity, have made it what
                    it is. The blood shed by the votaries of the God of mercy and peace, since the
                    establishment of his religion, would probably suffice to drown all other
                    sectaries now on the habitable globe."</p>
                <p>From these extracts, to which innumerable others of the same tendency might be
                    added, we see how great was the distance between Novalis, with his introspective
                    soul-life, and Shelley, with his practical enthusiasm for liberty.</p>
                <p>These, then, are the two poets whom men have attempted to represent as twin
                    spirits. They both rank high as lyric poets, though Shelley is a poetical genius
                    of a far higher type than Novalis. But even if Novalis were more on a level with
                    Shelley as a poet, how small is the measure of truth to be found in his works
                    compared with that in Shelley's!</p>
                <p>To Novalis, truth was poetry and dream; to Shelley, it was liberty. To Novalis it
                    was a firmly established and powerful Church; to Shelley a struggling,
                    sorely-pressed heresy; Novalis's truth sat on royal and papal thrones; Shelley's
                    was despised and powerless.</p>
                <p>To make any real impression on humanity, a truth, however great, must be made
                    man, must become flesh and blood. In the early biographies of Defoe, the author
                    of _Robinson Crusoe_, we are told that in July 1703 he was condemned, as author
                    of a certain pamphlet, first to have his ears cut off and then to be pilloried.
                    The day came, the sentence was carried out, the man with the pale, mutilated
                    face, dripping with blood, stood in the pillory, facing the assembled multitude.
                    Then, strange to say, in place of the usual loud hooting, with its accompaniment
                    of showers of rotten apples, eggs, potatoes, &amp;c., there fell a dead silence;
                    not an apple was thrown, not one abusive word was heard--Defoe was far too dear
                    to the hearts of the people. Presently one of the crowd, hoisted on his
                    neighbours' shoulders, placed a wreath upon the mutilated head. I read this when
                    I was a boy, and though I know now that Defoe did not lose his ears, so that
                    Pope was mistaken when he wrote--</p>
                <p> "Earless on high stood unabashed Defoe;"</p>
                <p>and though I also know that Defoe was not the pure character I took him to be at
                    that time, still the picture remains a grand one, and it has burned itself into
                    my soul. For it contains an eternal verity. As a general rule, truth upon this
                    earth presents much such an appearance as did the condemned author in the
                    pillory. And I remember thinking to myself at the time: "If a man chanced to
                    find such a poor, despised, oppressed truth in the pillory, what a great moment
                    in his life it would be if he might draw near and place the wreath upon its
                    brow!" Shelley did this--Novalis did not.</p>

                <p>[2] "We deem that man wise who seeks a companion for his nightly couch; then he
                    also is wise who has a beloved among the dead."</p>
                <p>[3] "I forgive envy; pity I cannot forgive. It is beyond my power to tell how I
                    revel in the thought of my approaching transfiguration, my sacrificial death. O
                    brother! the time is surely drawing nigh when all men, truly understanding
                    death, will welcome him with glad embrace, will feel that life is but the
                    anticipation of love, that death is the bridal kiss, and dissolution, which with
                    a bridegroom's ardour disrobes us in the bridal chamber, the hottest fire of
                    love."</p>

                <p> "Wenige wissen Das Geheimnis der Liebe, Fühlen Unersättlichkeit Und ewigen
                    Durst. Des Abendmahls Göttliche Bedeutung Ist den irdischen Sinnen Rätsel; Aber
                    wer jemals Von heissen, geliebten Lippen Atem des Lebens sog, Wem heilige Glut
                    In zitternden Wellen das Herz schmolz Wem das Auge aufging, Dass er des Himmels
                    Unergründliche Tiefe mass, Wird essen von seinem Leibe Und trinken von seinem
                    Blute Ewiglich. Wer hat des irdischen Leibes Hohen Sinn erraten? Wer kann sagen

                    Sehnsucht, Der nie leer wird. Sie erkännten der Liebe Unendliche Fülle, Und

                    moss-grown ruins one sees a marvellous future glistening; and what used to be
                    common and everyday, now seems miraculous. The kingdom of love has come; the
                    fable has begun to weave itself. Every soul is born again; words of power are
                    heard again; the great world-soul moves, and puts forth bud and blossom without

                    discovering, at last dissolving all into magic vapour. Sadness and rapture,
                    death and life, are here by inmost sympathy but one: he who has known the

                <p>LONGING--"THE BLUE FLOWER"</p>
                <p>I have described Romantic "soul" as intensity, without endeavour or desire, as
                    the glowing furnace in which liberty was asphyxiated and every tendency to
                    outward action destroyed. But this is not the exact truth. One outward tendency
                    remained, that which is known by the name of "longing" (Sehnsucht). Longing is
                    the Romantic equivalent of endeavour, and the mother of all Romantic poetry.
                    What is longing? It is a combination of lack and desire, without the
                    determination or the means to attain what one lacks and desires. And what is the
                    object of this longing? What but that which is the object of all longing and
                    desire, in however fine or hypocritical words it may clothe itself--enjoyment
                    and happiness. The Romanticist does not employ the word happiness, but it is
                    what he means. He does not say happiness, he says "the ideal." But do not let us
                    be deceived by words. The special characteristic of the Romanticist, however, is
                    not his search after happiness, but his belief that it exists, that it must be
                    in store for him, and that it will come to him when he least expects it. And
                    since it is the gift of Heaven, since he himself is not its creator, he may lead
                    as aimless a life as he will, guided only by his vague longing. All that is
                    necessary is to preserve his faith that this longing will be satisfied. And it
                    is a faith easy to preserve, for everything around him is full of omens and
                    prophecies of the accomplishment of his desire.</p>
                <p>It was Novalis who gave to the object of Romantic longing the famous, mystic name
                    of "the blue flower." The expression is, of course, not to be understood
                    literally. The "blue flower" is a mysterious symbol, something of the nature of
                    ΙΧθΥΣ, the Fish of the early Christians. It is an abbreviation, a condensed
                    formulation of all that infinitude of bliss for which a languishing human heart
                    is capable of longing. Hence glimpses of it are caught long before it is
                    reached; it is dreamed of long before it is seen; it is divined now here, now
                    there, in what proves to be a delusion, is seen for a moment amongst other
                    flowers, only to vanish immediately; but its fragrance is perceptible, at times
                    only faint, at times strong, and the seeker is intoxicated by it. Though, like
                    the butterfly, he flutters from flower to flower, settling now upon a violet,
                    now upon some tropical plant, he is always seeking and longing for the one
                    thing--perfect, ideal happiness.</p>
                <p>It is with this longing and its object that Novalis's principal work deals. It is
                    a work which we must study, and, to understand it aright, we must first see how
                    it came into existence.</p>
                <p>Its germ is contained in Goethe's _Wilhelm Meister_, and we can clearly trace the
                    mental processes by which _Wilhelm Meister_ is slowly transmuted into _Heinrich
                    von Ofterdingen_. Wilhelm does not act, he is acted upon. He does not strive, he
                    longs. He pursues ideals, seeking them first on the stage, then in real life.
                    Wilhelm too, is the offspring of "soul." The book is pervaded by soul. It is not
                    only that the characters, like those of many modern English novels (some of
                    Dickens's, for instance), are full of soul, but there is, as it were, soul in
                    the peculiar, hazy atmosphere which surrounds them. No feature is realistically
                    coarse or decided; the children of soul have soft contours. Heiberg once summed
                    up Goethe's philosophy, of which he himself was a disciple, in the following
                    sentence: "Goethe is neither immoral nor irreligious, in the general acceptation
                    of the word, but he shows that there are no unconditional laws of duty, and that
                    we must place our religion on the same level as our poetry and philosophy." We
                    are struck in reading _Wilhelm Meister_ by the manner in which rigid school or
                    text-book ethics, the narrow-minded, conventional ideas of morality and equity,
                    are so re-moulded that morality is no longer regarded as the absolute law of
                    life, but simply as an important principle of life, one among others all equally
                    legitimate and equally under control--just as the brain of the animal, important
                    as it is, is not, in the estimation of the physiologist, the one part of
                    consequence, but simply an organ, fulfilling its task in association with the
                    heart, the liver, and the other organs. Hence sensuality is not abused as
                    animal, but (in Philine) simply and straightforwardly represented as pleasant
                    and attractive. The harmonious development of Wilhelm's nature is arrived at by
                    the aid of many doubtful experiences. In the female characters we are called on
                    to admire well-bred self-possession and the innate nobility of a beautiful
                    nature; the physical and mental superiority and freedom which are the result of
                    a highly favoured and assured position, are sympathetically portrayed in the
                    personages of rank. It may seem objectionable to us nowadays that "noble" and
                    "aristocratic" are evidently often regarded as synonyms, but the reason for it
                    is to be sought in the deplorable, straitened social conditions of the Germany
                    of Goethe's day. As the tale is not the offspring of the union of imagination
                    and reality, but of imagination and "soul," there is something unreal in its
                    whole character; much is veiled, much refined away; everything is so idealised
                    that the material world stands, as it were, in the shadow of the spiritual.</p>
                <p>Only private circumstances and persons are dealt with. War is, indeed, alluded
                    to, and in such a manner that we are enabled to conclude that the war following
                    on the French Revolution is meant; but nothing definite is said about it. As to
                    the locality, we are led to the conclusion that it is somewhere in Central
                    Germany; but the landscape possesses no marked features, it only chimes in like
                    a faint musical accompaniment to the mood. In the world depicted in the tale,
                    art is regarded, in the perverted fashion of the day, as the school of life,
                    instead of life as the school of art; national, historical events are but "etwas
                    Theatergeräusch hinter den Koulissen" (a little noise behind the scenes).[1]
                    None of the characters have any practical aim in view; they are simply driven
                    onward by the current of their longings and moods; they wander about,
                    untrammelled by circumstances, heedless of the boundaries of countries, leading
                    "planless" existences.</p>
                <p>Goethe's avoidance of all psychological extremes is a significant witness to the
                    centripetal tendency of "soul." Such an extreme is crime, conceived of as
                    criminal. Even where Goethe touches upon the horrible, as, for example,
                    incestuous passion (the story of the Harper), his desire is only that we should
                    be powerfully affected, not that we should judge; he does not bring the case
                    before the moral, much less before the legal tribunal. And the story loses some
                    of its painfulness from the manner in which it is communicated to us. We do not
                    hear it from the Harper himself; his lips are sealed; it is told us after his
                    death by a stranger.</p>
                <p>It is in this highly idealised world, on which the poet's hand has set the seal
                    of beauty, that Wilhelm wanders about, without a plan, but not without an aim.
                    He is in pursuit of the ideal--an ideal profession, an ideal woman, ideal
                    culture. He is first a merchant, then an actor, then a doctor; loves first
                    Marianne, then the Countess, then Therese, then Nathalie. His first ideal of
                    culture is experience, his second intellectual refinement; then he seeks it in
                    renunciation; and he ends with experiments in social reform which made the
                    _Wanderjahre_, in its day, one of the books to which socialistic revolutionaries
                    most eagerly appealed. But the main thing to be noted is, that Wilhelm is
                    constantly remoulding his ideal. He does not find it; he loses it, so to speak.
                    It is not so much that he becomes the bourgeois, the philistine (Spiessbürger),
                    as that the word loses its meaning for him.</p>
                <p>It often happens to the young man who throws himself eagerly into the study of
                    philosophy in search of enlightenment as to God, eternity, the aim of life, and
                    the immortality of the soul, that, as he studies, these words lose the meaning
                    he at first attributed to them; he obtains an answer to his questions, but an
                    answer which teaches him that these questions must be differently put. The same
                    thing happens in life to Wilhelm, with his longing for a preconceived ideal.
                    Many have embraced the cloud instead of Juno; Wilhelm lets the cloud go, and
                    presses Juno to his heart.</p>
                <p>_Wilhelm Meister_ had almost as much share as _Die Herzensergiessungen eines
                    Klosterbruders_ in the production of Tieck's _Sternbald_, which is throughout an
                    echo of Goethe's great work. Immediately after the appearance of _Wilhelm
                    Meister_, Tieck sketched the plot of a very interesting story, _Der junge
                    Tischlermeister_ ("The Young Carpenter"), which was not published until
                    forty-one years later. The hero, an almost too accomplished and artistic young
                    carpenter, goes through a process of development which exactly resembles Wilhelm
                    Meister's, as far as the influence of aristocratic acquaintances, of dramatic
                    art, and the theatre is concerned. A true Romanticist, he produces Shakespeare's
                    comedies in a private theatre which is an exact imitation of the theatres of
                    Shakespeare's day, and is the lover both on the stage and behind the scenes.</p>
                <p>This work was set aside in favour of _Sternbald_. The modern tradesman had to
                    give way to the artist of the Romantic period of Albert Dürer. _Sternbald_ is
                    the apotheosis of "soul," of pure soul, without admixture of reason and
                    lucidity. Hence the sum and substance of the book is desire, pining desire;
                    hence we are told of such an event as the Reformation, that, instead of
                    generating a divine fulness of religion, it only generated the emptiness of
                    reason, in which all hearts languish; hence the mild sensuality of Goethe's
                    romance becomes brutal desire of the William Lovell type. The hero, when he
                    looks within himself, sees, like Lovell, "a fathomless whirlpool, a rushing,
                    deafening enigma." In the second edition Tieck thought it advisable to cut out
                    some of the too numerous wanton bathing and drinking scenes amidst which the
                    restless longing of the hero runs riot.</p>
                <p>But the principal thing to which I would draw attention is, that reality is here
                    refined and distilled in a manner unknown to Goethe. It is attenuated into
                    vapour--emotional vapour; personality is drowned in landscape, action in the
                    music of the woodman's horn. In _Sternbald_ every day is a Sunday; a devotional
                    feeling pervades the air; we seem to hear the church bells ring and to know that
                    the world is at leisure. The following words of the hero contain the philosophy
                    of the book: "In this world we can only desire, we can only live in intentions;
                    real action belongs to the hereafter." Consequently there is no action in the
                    story; the characters wander about with as little apparent purpose as comets;
                    their lives consist of a series of accidental, unsought adventures; they are
                    always travelling in search of the ideal, and as the ideal is generally supposed
                    to have taken up its abode somewhere in the neighbourhood of Rome, the book ends
                    there--the _story_ is not brought to a conclusion, and is never continued.</p>
                <p>It is precisely because of its dreaminess and disconnectedness that Novalis
                    prefers _Sternbald_ to _Wilhelm Meister_. "For," says he, "the kernel of my
                    philosophy is the belief that the poetical is the absolutely real, and that the
                    more poetical anything is, the truer it is. Therefore, the task of the poet is
                    not to idealise, but to cast a spell. The poetry of the fairy tale is the true
                    poetry. A fairy tale is a disconnected dream-picture, and its strength lies in
                    its being exactly the reverse of the true world, and yet exactly like it." The
                    world of the future, according to Novalis, is rational chaos--chaos which
                    prevails. The genuine fairy tale must therefore, he maintains, be not a mere
                    tale, but also prophetic representation, ideal, inevitable. The real fairy tale
                    writer is the modern seer. The romance, the novel, is, as it were, free history,
                    the mythology of history. And love, being the form of morality which implies the
                    possibility of magic, is the soul of the novel, the foundation of all romances,
                    all novels. For where true love is, there marvellous, miraculous things
                    happen.</p>
                <p>These obscure, yet in a manner unambiguous expressions of Novalis's opinions on
                    the subject of the true nature of poetry and romance, make it easy for us to
                    understand his judgment of _Wilhelm Meister_, a book he had greatly admired in
                    early youth. For in _Wilhelm Meister_, as in _Torquato Tasso_, poetry has to
                    give way to reality, the poetic conception of life to the practical. Novalis
                    could imagine nothing more shameful than this; it was sin against the holy
                    spirit of poetry. In the novel, in fiction, poetry is not to be done away with,
                    not even to be restricted, but to be exalted and glorified.</p>
                <p>So he determines to write a novel which shall be the direct antithesis of
                    _Wilhelm Meister_. He even takes thought of such small matters as type and size,
                    and determines that in them _Heinrich von Ofterdingen_ shall be the exact
                    counterpart of the book, the worldly philosophy of which it is to refute by its
                    magic mysticism. He writes to Tieck: "My novel is in full swing; it is to be a
                    deification of poetry. In the first part Heinrich von Ofterdingen ripens into a
                    poet; in the second he is the glorified poet. The story will have many points of
                    resemblance with your _Sternbald_ but will lack its lightness. This want,
                    however, may not be a disadvantage, considering the subject."</p>
                <p>Goethe and _Wilhelm Meister_ Novalis criticises thus: "Goethe is an altogether
                    practical poet. His works are what English wares are--simple, neat, suitable to
                    their purpose, and durable.... He has, like the Englishman, a natural sense of
                    order and economy, and an acquired sense of what is fine and noble.... _Wilhelm
                    Meister's Lehrjahre_ is, in a way, altogether modern and prosaic. Romance
                    perishes in it, and so does the poetry, the magic quality, of nature. The book
                    only deals with everyday human affairs; nature, and the belief in her mysterious
                    powers, are quite forgotten. It is a poetically written story of bourgeois
                    domestic life, in which the marvellous is expressly treated as poetry and fancy.
                    Artistic atheism is the spirit of the book. _Wilhelm Meister_ is a _Candide_
                    directed against poetry."</p>
                <p>Novalis's aim, then, is to produce a work exactly the opposite of this, one in
                    which everything is finally resolved into poetry, in which "the world becomes
                    soul." For everything is soul. "Nature is to the soul what a solid body is to
                    light. The solid substance stops light, breaks it up into wonderful colours,
                    &amp;c., &amp;c. Human beings are soul prisms."</p>
                <p>His novel is, then, an allegory, the key to which is contained in the fairy-tale
                    introduced into the story. This fairy-tale is supposed to show how the true
                    eternal world comes into existence; it is a description of the restoration of
                    that kingdom of love and poetry in which the great "world-soul expands and
                    blooms everlastingly." Novalis believes that, since the existing heaven and the
                    existing earth are of a prosaic nature, and since our age is an age of
                    utilitarianism, a poetical day of judgment must come, a spell must be broken,
                    before the new life can blossom forth.--Arcturus and his daughter slumber,
                    frozen in their palace of ice. They are released by Fable (i.e. Poetry) and her
                    brother, Eros. Eros is the child of the restless father, Reason, and the
                    faithful mother, the Heart. Fable owes her being to unfaithfulness on the part
                    of Reason; she is born of Fancy, daughter of the Moon; her godmother is the
                    guardian of the domestic altar, Sophia, Heavenly Wisdom.</p>
                <p>Against the good powers in this allegory a conspiracy is formed by the Writer.
                    The Writer is the spirit of prose, of narrow enlightenment; he is depicted as
                    constantly writing. When Sophia dips what he has written into a bowl which
                    stands upon the altar, a little of it sometimes remains legible, but often it is
                    all washed out. If drops from the bowl happen to fall upon him, they fall from
                    him again in the shape of numbers and geometric figures, which he eagerly
                    collects, strings upon a thread, and wears round his neck as an ornament. The
                    Writer is Novalis's Nureddin. The result of his plot is the imprisonment of the
                    Father and Mother and the destruction of the altar.</p>
                <p>But Fable has escaped. She descends into the realm of Evil, and exterminates Evil
                    by delivering up the Passions to the power of the death-bringing Fates. Time and
                    Mortality are now no more. "The last thread of the flax is spun; the lifeless is
                    reanimated; life reigns." In a universal conflagration, the mother, the Heart,
                    is burned to death, the sun disappears, and the ice is melted round the palace
                    of Arcturus. Through a new, happy earth, stretching far and wide under a new
                    heaven, Eros and Fable pass into the palace. Fable has fulfilled her mission;
                    she has brought Eros to his beloved, the daughter of the king. The kingdom of
                    poetry and love is established.</p>
                <p> "Gegründet ist das Reich der Ewigkeit; In Lieb und Frieden endigt sich der
                    Streit; Vorüber ging der lange Traum der Schmerzen; Sophie ist ewig Priesterin
                    der Herzen."[2]</p>
                <p>Sophia occupies the same place in this allegory that Beatrice does in Dante's
                    great poem.</p>
                <p>The glorification of the old Meistersinger is, of course, intended as a
                    glorification of poetry in general, but his story, as told in the novel, is
                    really the story of Hardenberg's own life and endeavour. Heinrich von
                    Ofterdingen's home and quiet childhood remind us of Hardenberg's. A dream, which
                    seems doubly rich in omen because his father as a youth had dreamed one like it,
                    gives him a fore-feeling of the mysterious happiness of the poet's life, and
                    shows him, in the form of a wonderful blue flower, the object of the poet's
                    longing and endeavour.</p>
                <p>In order that he may acquire some knowledge of the world, it is decided that
                    Heinrich and his mother shall travel, in company with a number of merchants, to
                    Augsburg. The incidents of the journey and the tales of his travelling
                    companions enrich him with impressions, and fertilise the germs of poetical
                    productivity that lie latent in his soul. For all their talk is of poetry and
                    poets; they tell him the story of Arion, and popular legends in which poets are
                    the equals of kings, and they philosophise on the subject of poetry and art, not
                    like merchants of the most barbarous period of the Middle Ages, but like
                    Romanticists of the year 1801. One of them, for example, gives the following
                    pantheistic explanation of the instinctive impulse of mankind towards plastic
                    art: "Nature, desiring to have some enjoyment of all the art that there is in
                    her, has metamorphosed herself into human beings. In their minds, through them,
                    she rejoices in her own glory, selects what is most pleasant and lovely, and
                    reproduces it in such a manner that she may possess and enjoy it in manifold
                    ways."</p>
                <p>In a castle to which they come, Heinrich meets a captive Eastern girl, whose
                    touching plaint it is interesting to compare with the song of the Oriental
                    beauty (La Captive) in Victor Hugo's _Les Orientales_. In a book belonging to a
                    mysterious hermit (the original of the charcoal-burner's book in Ingemann's
                    _Valdemar Sejer_) he finds the history of his own life.</p>
                <p>The travellers arrive at Augsburg, and here Heinrich makes the acquaintance of a
                    poet and a fascinating young girl. In Klingsohr he has a noble example of the
                    fully developed poet, a poet whose utterances in many ways remind us of
                    Goethe's. Almost everything that Klingsohr says is surprisingly rational and
                    wise; we can scarcely understand how Novalis himself failed to take any of it to
                    heart. The following are some of his remarks: "I cannot too strongly recommend
                    you to follow your natural inclination to penetrate into the reason of things,
                    to study the laws of causation. Nothing is more indispensable to the poet than
                    insight into the nature of every event, and knowledge of the means whereby to
                    attain every aim.... Enthusiasm without understanding is useless and dangerous,
                    and the poet will be able to effect few miracles if he is himself astonished by
                    miracles.... The young poet cannot be too calm, too thoughtful. True, melodious
                    eloquence demands a wide, calm, observing mind." Upon one point, however,
                    Klingsohr and Novalis are entirely agreed, namely, that everything is, and must
                    be, poetry. "It is a great misfortune that poetry should have a special name,
                    and that poets should form a separate guild. There is nothing separate or
                    special about poetry. It is the mode of action characteristic of the human mind.
                    Do not all men aspire poetically every moment of their lives?"</p>
                <p>All Heinrich's love longings are satisfied when he sees Klingsohr's daughter,
                    Mathilde. He feels once more as he felt when he saw the vision of the "blue
                    flower." But Mathilde is drowned. Heinrich loses her as Novalis had lost Sophie
                    von Kühn. Utterly broken down, he leaves Augsburg. He is comforted in his sorrow
                    by a vision (like the visions Novalis had at Sophie's grave) in which he sees
                    the departed and hears her voice. In a distant monastery, the mission of whose
                    monks it is to keep alive the sacred fire in young souls, and which seems to be
                    a species of "spirit-colony," he lives "with the departed." He experiences all
                    the sensations to which Novalis has given expression in the _Hymns to Night_.
                    Then he returns from the spirit-world to life, and falls in love with a being no
                    less wonderful than the object of his first passion. Mathilde's place is filled
                    by Cyane.</p>
                <p>The second part of the novel is only sketched. Heinrich wanders the whole world
                    round. After going through every earthly experience, "he retires again into his
                    soul, as to his old home." Things material now become transformed into things
                    spiritual. "The world becomes a dream, the dream becomes the world." Heinrich
                    finds Mathilde again, but she is no longer distinguishable from Cyane--just as,
                    in Novalis's own life, Julie was not Julie, but Sophie come to life again. And
                    now "the festival of soul," of love and eternal fidelity, is celebrated. On this
                    occasion allegory reigns supreme. The principle of good and the principle of
                    evil appear in open competition, singing antiphonies; the sciences do the same,
                    even mathematics. We hear much about Indian plants--probably the lotus-flower
                    was made to play a part as partaking of the nature of the "blue flower."</p>
                <p>The end of the story is merely indicated. Heinrich finds the "blue flower"--it is
                    Mathilde. "Heinrich plucks the blue flower, and releases Mathilde from the spell
                    which has bound her, but loses her again. Stunned by grief, he turns into a
                    stone. Edda, who, besides being herself, is also the 'blue flower,' the Oriental
                    captive, and Mathilde (fourfold 'Doppelgängerei'), sacrifices herself to the
                    stone. It turns into a singing tree. Cyane hews down the tree, and burns herself
                    along with it, upon which it turns into a golden ram. Edda-Mathilde is compelled
                    to sacrifice the ram, and Heinrich becomes a man once more. During these
                    transformations he has all manner of wonderful conversations." This we can
                    readily believe.</p>
                <p>In Danish literature the work most allied to _Heinrich von Ofterdingen_ is
                    Ingemann's _De Sorte Riddere_ ("The Black Knights"). We learn from Ingemann's
                    autobiography how exactly his frame of mind at the time he was writing this book
                    corresponded to that of the German Romanticist. "I paid but little attention to
                    all the great events that were happening in the outer world. Even the
                    conflagration of Moscow, the destruction of the Great Army, and the fall of
                    Napoleon were to me ephemeral phenomena ... even in the German War of Liberation
                    I only saw a divided nation in conflict with itself, noble powers without any
                    principle of unity and concord. _Between the ideal life and human life there lay
                    a yawning abyss_, which only the heavenly rainbow of love and poetry could
                    bridge over.... I wrote myself into a fairy labyrinth, in which love was my
                    Ariadne-thread, and in which I hoped, with the great harp of the poetry of life,
                    the strings of which are strung by genius from rock to rock over black abysses,
                    _to lull the monsters of existence to sleep_, resolve the dissonances in the
                    great world-harmony, and solve the world-mystery." The result of this attempt
                    was woeful.</p>
                <p>It is certain that in _Heinrich von Ofterdingen_ Novalis succeeded in producing
                    something as unlike Wilhelm Meister as possible. The "blue flower" was the
                    emblem of the ideal. Here we have the real forgotten in the ideal, and the ideal
                    in its emblem. Poetry is entirely separated from life. Novalis thinks that this
                    is as it should be. In _Ofterdingen_ he says of poets: "Many and important
                    events would only disturb them. A simple life is their lot, and they must make
                    acquaintance with the varied and numberless phenomena of the outer world only by
                    means of tales and books. Only seldom during the course of their lives is it
                    permissible for them to be drawn into the wild eddy of some great event, in
                    order that they may acquire a more accurate knowledge of the position and
                    character of men of action. Their receptive minds are quite sufficiently
                    occupied with near and simple phenomena.... Here upon earth already in
                    possession of the peace of heaven, untormented by vain desires, only inhaling
                    the fragrance of earthly fruits, not devouring them, they are free guests, whose
                    golden feet tread lightly, and whose presence causes all involuntarily to spread
                    their wings.... If we compare the poet with the hero, we shall find that the
                    poet's song has many a time awakened heroic courage in youthful hearts, but
                    never that heroic deeds have called the spirit of poetry to life in any
                    soul."</p>
                <p>The fundamental error could not have been defined more clearly. According to this
                    theory, poetry is not the expression of life and its deeds; no, life and its
                    deeds have poetry as their _origin_. Poetry creates life. Undoubtedly there is
                    poetry of which this may be true; but if there be any one kind of poetry of
                    which it could never be true, it is the kind under consideration. To what
                    possible deed could it incite? To the changing of one's self into a singing tree
                    or a golden ram? There is no question of action in it at all, only of
                    longing.</p>
                <p>All the best of Novalis's work is simply an expression of this longing, which
                    includes every desire, from the purely natural ones to the most transcendental
                    aspiration. Perhaps the most beautiful things he has written are two songs--the
                    one giving expression to the sensuous longings of the young girl, the other to
                    the longing which is part and parcel of the enthusiastic friendship of young
                    men.</p>
                <p>The song in which the young girls complain of the hardships of their lot is
                    charming. Here the "blue flower" is simply the forbidden fruit. But the longing
                    is expressed with bewitching roguishness. In the poem "To a Friend," again, we
                    have it expressed with fervency and solemnity:--</p>
                <p> "Was passt, das muss sich ründen, Was sich versteht, sich finden, Was gut ist,
                    sich verbinden, Was liebt, zusammen sein, Was hindert, muss entweichen, Was
                    krumm ist, muss sich gleichen, Was fern ist, sich erreichen, Was keimt, das muss
                    gedeihn.</p>
                <p> "Gieb treulich mir die Hände, Sei Bruder mir und wende Den Blick vor Deinem Ende
                    Nicht wieder weg von mir. Ein Tempel, wo wir knieen, Ein Ort, wohin wir ziehen,
                    Ein Glück, für das wir glühen, Ein Himmel mir und Dir!"</p>
                <p>The longing here is almost that of the Crusader--a seeking in the far distance
                    for something great and glorious. The "blue flower" melts into the blue of the
                    horizon. Its very colour betokens distance.</p>
                <p>Let us dwell for a moment longer on this flower. In Spielhagen's _Problematische
                    Naturen_, one of the characters says: "You remember the blue flower in Novalis's
                    tale? Do you know what it is? It is the flower which no mortal eye has seen, yet
                    the fragrance of which fills the world. Not every creature is delicately enough
                    organised to perceive its perfume; but the nightingale is intoxicated with it
                    when she sings and wails and sobs in the moonlight and the grey dawn; and so
                    were, and so are, all the foolish human beings who, in prose and verse, have
                    poured, and are pouring, forth their woes to Heaven; and so, too, are millions
                    more, to whom no God has granted the power to say what they suffer, and who look
                    up in dumb anguish to the Heaven which has no mercy upon them. And alas! for
                    this suffering there is no cure--none except death. For him who has once inhaled
                    the fragrance of the blue flower there is not a peaceful hour left in life. Like
                    a murderer, or like one who has turned away the Lord from his door, he is driven
                    onward, ever onward, however much his tired limbs ache, and however fervently he
                    longs to lay down his weary head. When he is tormented by thirst, he begs at
                    some hut for a drink; but he hands back the empty vessel without a word of
                    thanks, for it was dirty, or there was an ugly insect in the water--in any case,
                    he had found no refreshment in it. Refreshment! Where are the eyes which have
                    taken from us the desire ever to look into other, brighter, more ardent eyes?
                    Where the breast upon which we have rested with the certain knowledge that we
                    should never long to listen to the beating of a warmer, more loving heart?
                    Where? Can you tell me where?"</p>
                <p>"Love," so runs the reply, "is the fragrance of the blue flower, which, as you
                    have said, fills the world; and in every being whom you love with your whole
                    heart you have found the blue flower."</p>
                <p>"I fear that is not a solution of the riddle," says the hero sorrowfully, "for
                    this very condition, that we should love with our whole hearts ... we can never
                    fulfil. Which of us can love with his whole heart? We are all so weary, so worn
                    out, that we have neither the strength nor the courage essential to true,
                    serious love--that love which does not rest until it has taken possession of
                    every thought of a man's mind, every feeling of his heart, every drop of blood
                    in his veins."</p>
                <p>This interpretation is a beautiful one, and it is not incorrect, but it is not
                    exhaustive. It is not only in love, but in every domain of life that the "blue
                    flower" represents perfect, and hence to that extent ideal, but still purely
                    personal happiness. The longing for this, from its nature unattainable,
                    happiness is the constant, restless desire depicted by all the Romanticists.</p>
                <p>Perhaps not one of the regular German Romanticists is so completely the poet of
                    Romantic longing as Shack Staffeldt, who, though a German born, wrote in Danish.
                    But he does not depict the longing which produced outward restlessness. His
                    longing is far too deep to be satisfied by wandering about the world. It is in
                    the writings of certain of the later Romanticists that longing appears as the
                    restless desire which drives man from place to place.</p>
                <p>Of this it seems to me that we have the most typical description in Eichendorff's
                    novel, _Aus dem Leben eines Taugenichts_ ("The Life of a Ne'er-Do-Well").
                    Published in 1824, this book was written twenty years after _Heinrich von
                    Ofterdingen_, though by a man only ten years Novalis's junior, a disciple of
                    Tieck, an ultra-Romanticist of a pious, amiable disposition.</p>
                <p>Joseph, Baron von Eichendorff, the son of a nobleman of high position, was born
                    in Upper Silesia in 1788. His family being Catholic, his early education was
                    superintended by a Catholic ecclesiastic. In 1805 he went to the University of
                    Halle to study law, and, amongst other lectures, attended those of Professors
                    Schleiermacher and Steffens, the latter of whom had a special attraction for
                    him. It was here that he made his first acquaintance with Romantic literature;
                    Novalis opened to him a new dream-world, rich in promise. In his very first
                    holidays he went to Wandsbeck to visit old Claudius, whom he had loved from his
                    early boyhood. Claudius's paper, the _Wandsbecker Bote_, had been his greatest
                    comfort in the days when his tutor plagued him with instructive children's
                    books. There is something of Claudius's mild humour in Eichendorffs own
                    poetry.</p>
                <p>The year 1807 found him at Heidelberg, where he made the acquaintance of the
                    Romanticists living there, Arnim, Brentano, and Görres being the most notable.
                    He assisted in editing _Des Knaben Wunderhorn_ (a famous collection of popular
                    songs and poetry), and collaborated with Görres in his work on the old popular
                    literature. In 1809 he met Arnim and Brentano again in Berlin; here he also made
                    the acquaintance of Adam Müller, who exercised a considerable influence upon
                    him. He was strongly influenced, too, by Fichte's lectures.</p>
                <p>As there seemed no prospect of a career for him in Prussia, he went in 1810 to
                    Vienna, intending to enter the service of the Austrian Government. In Vienna he
                    spent much of his time in the company of Friedrich Schlegel, formed a close
                    friendship with Schlegel's stepson, Philipp Veit, the painter, and wrote his
                    first, exaggeratedly Romantic story, _Ahnung und Gegenwart_, which is nothing
                    but a collection of lyric dreams and fancies. Nevertheless, in this work, as
                    well as in his later productions, it was his desire to contrast the "fervent
                    harmony existing between healthy, fresh humanity and nature, in forest, stream,
                    and mountain, shining mornings and dreamy starlit nights, with the empty
                    pleasures of the great world, and the affected prudery or real depravity of the
                    period." As in all his works, adventure predominates. As soon as he quits the
                    domain of merry vagabond life and romantic adventure, he is in danger of
                    relapsing into the supernatural and horrible.</p>
                <p>Instead of entering the Austrian Government service as he had intended, he
                    determined to take part in the war against Napoleon. He joined Lützow's famous
                    Free Corps, and was attached to a militia battalion. He had just been discharged
                    when the news came of Napoleon's return from Elba. He immediately enlisted
                    again, and entered Paris with the German troops.</p>
                <p>In course of time he received an appointment in the Prussian Kultusministerium
                    (department of religion and education), and developed into a conscientious and
                    capable official. In 1840, a dispute between the Government and the Roman
                    Catholic bishops produced strained relations between him (the good Catholic) and
                    the head of his department. He sent in his resignation, but it was not
                    immediately accepted; he was commissioned to prepare a report on the restoration
                    of the castle of Marienburg.</p>
                <p>Having made himself master of the Spanish language, he translated some of
                    Calderon's _Autos Sacramentales_. This pursuit led to a still closer connection
                    between him and the leaders of the Ultramontane party. In his later years he
                    criticised modern German literature in the spirit of orthodox Catholicism,
                    writing of the Catholic tendency of the Romanticists as if it were the most
                    important and best feature of the school, and treating the change of opinion of
                    some of the leaders in regard to this matter as a falling away from the truth
                    and a sign of literary decadence. He looked with contempt upon Schiller's
                    heroes, with their "rhetorical ideality," and upon the symbolic "Naturpoesie" of
                    Goethe's shorter poems. "How different," he says, "is the great idea of
                    Romanticism, _homesickness_, longing for the lost home--that is to say, for the
                    universal, the Catholic Church." With these unsound theories Eichendorff
                    combined real and considerable lyrical talent. No one has given, in a condensed
                    form, better representations of the longings and the ideals of Romanticism. In
                    the little story, _Aus dem Leben eines Taugenichts_, we seem to hear young
                    Romanticism twittering and singing as if he had caught it bodily and shut it up
                    in a cage. It is all there--the fragrance of the woods and the song of the
                    birds; longing for travel and delight in it, especially when Italy is the goal;
                    Sunday emotions and moonlight; genuine Romantic vagrancy and idleness--such
                    idleness that from want of use the limbs actually begin to fall out of joint,
                    and the hero begins to feel as though he "were tumbling to pieces."</p>
                <p>The Ne'er-Do-Well is a miller's son, young and poor, whose only pleasure in life
                    is to lie under the trees and look up into the sky, or to roam aimlessly about
                    the country with his zither, singing such sad and beautiful songs that the
                    hearts of all who hear him "long." "Every one," he says, "has his allotted place
                    upon this earth, his warm hearth, his cup of coffee, his wife, his glass of wine
                    of an evening, and is content. But I am content nowhere." He, the humble
                    gardener (for such, when he does work, is his occupation), adores a high-born,
                    lovely lady whom he has only seen once or twice; he addresses her in a beautiful
                    and touching song:--</p>
                <p> "Wohin ich geh' und schaue In Feld und Wald und Thal, Vom Berg hinab in die Aue,
                    Vielschöne, hohe Fraue, Grüss ich dich tausendmal.</p>
                <p> In meinem Garten find' ich Viel Blumen, schön und fein, Viel Kränze wohl draus
                    wind' ich, Und tausend Gedanken bind' ich Und Grüsse mit darein.</p>
                <p> "Ihr darf ich keinen reichen, Sie ist zu hoch und schön; Sie müssen alle
                    verbleichen, Die Liebe nur ohne Gleichen Bleibt ewig im Herzen stehn.</p>
                <p> "Ich schein' wohl froher Dinge Und schaffe auf und ab, Und ob das Herz
                    zerspringe, Ich grabe fort und singe Und grab' mir bald mein Grab."[3]</p>
                <p>Through his lady's influence he is promoted to the post of rent-collector for the
                    castle. He inherits from his predecessor a magnificent dressing-gown, red with
                    yellow spots, a pair of green slippers, a nightcap, and some long-stemmed
                    pipes.</p>
                <p>Arrayed in his new splendour, and smoking the longest pipe he can find, he lives
                    a quiet, easy life for some time, digging up all the potatoes and vegetables in
                    his garden and planting flowers in their stead, listening with rapture to a
                    distant hunting or post horn, and placing a bouquet every morning upon a stone
                    table where his lady is certain to find it. This goes on until she vanishes from
                    his horizon. As he is sitting alone one day over his account-book, his zither
                    lying beside him, a sunbeam falls through the window upon its dusty strings. "It
                    touched a string in my heart. 'Yes,' said I; 'come away, my faithful zither! Our
                    kingdom is not of this world!'" So he leaves behind his account-book,
                    dressing-gown, slippers, and pipe, and wanders out into the wide world; to Italy
                    first.</p>
                <p>This Ne'er-Do-Well is the most comical, awkward, childlike creature one can
                    imagine; in mind he is about ten years old, and he never grows any older. Like
                    Andersen's heroes, the Improvisatore and O.T., he is repeatedly saved from
                    temptation simply by his ignorance and inexperience. He never realises what is
                    going on around him. Things happen to him without his doing anything to bring
                    them about. He is the central figure of a group of characters who all pursue
                    callings which leave them as free as he is himself--painters travelling to
                    Italy, an artist who runs away with his lady-love, musicians wandering from town
                    to town, and roaming students, who trudge along, singing student songs. Compared
                    with this life of wandering and seeking and expectation, ordinary, every-day
                    life naturally appears excessively monotonous. When the hero returns to his
                    native town, he finds the new rent-collector sitting at his door, wearing the
                    same spotted dressing-gown, the same slippers, &amp;c. After having spent his
                    life seeking for his "blue flower," he finds it at last at home. His first
                    rapture is described playfully, almost in Hans Andersen's manner, as follows:
                    "It was such a pleasure to hear her talk so brightly and trustfully to me, that
                    I could have listened to her till morning. I was as happy as I could be. I took
                    a handful of almonds, which I had brought all the way from Italy, out of my
                    pocket. She took some, and we sat and cracked them, and looked contentedly out
                    over the peaceful scene."</p>
                <p>The Ne'er-Do-Well may be regarded as the representative, the spokesman, of the
                    ornamental, profitless arts, and of infinite longing. _Infinite longing!_ Let us
                    imprint these words in our memory, for they are the foundation-stone of Romantic
                    poetry.</p>
                <p>The longing took curiously morbid forms in the less healthy Romantic souls. The
                    well-known German author, Franz Horn, informs us in his autobiography that at
                    the age of three or four he was already capable of poetic longing and suffering,
                    and of divining life in apparently dead things. He goes on to say that the
                    child-like mysticism of a certain popular refrain had a perfectly magic
                    attraction for him. He quotes the verse in question, and it proves to be none
                    other than the good old rhyme: "Ladybird, Ladybird, fly away home!"</p>
                <p> "Maikäfer flieg! Dein Vater ist im Krieg, Deine Mutter ist im Pommerland, Und
                    Pommerland ist abgebrannt, Maikäfer flieg!"[4]</p>
                <p>The other children were hard-hearted enough to laugh at this poem, but to him it
                    seemed most touching. The unhappy cockchafer was fatherless and motherless. His
                    father was in the wars, and "what might not come of that?" And his mother? Of
                    her "the news was still more uncertain." She was in far-off Pomerania, and
                    Pomerania was on fire! What scope for fancy! And there was the poor cockchafer,
                    too, borne on the wings of his longing out into the wide, wide world, seeking,
                    ever seeking.--We positively feel as if we were turning into children again.</p>
                <p>But let us return to the idea that underlies all this. The longing of the
                    individual for infinite happiness rests, as has already been said, upon the
                    belief that this infinite happiness is attainable by man. But this belief, in
                    its turn, rests upon the individual's Romantic conviction of his own infinite
                    importance. The doctrine of immortality itself is only a result of belief in the
                    cosmic importance of the individual. And this belief in the infinite importance
                    of each separate individual is genuinely medieval. Whole sciences, such as
                    astrology, were founded upon it. The very stars of heaven were supposed to have
                    a close connection with the destinies of individual men, and actually to occupy
                    themselves with them. Heaven and earth and all that in them is, revolved round
                    man. The Romanticists naturally feel the want of astrology, and would fain have
                    the science restored. What they call the "blue flower" is what in astrology was
                    called a man's planet, and in alchemy, the philosopher's stone.</p>
                <p>In his lectures _Upon the Literature, Art, and Spirit of the Age_ (1802), A. W.
                    Schlegel writes: "In the same sense in which we may call Kepler the last
                    astrologist, we may demand that _astronomy should become astrology_ again.
                    Astrology fell into disrepute because it made pretensions to science which it
                    could not sustain; but the fact of its having made such pretensions does not
                    take away the idea, the imperishable truths, which lie at its foundation. There
                    is unquestionably something more sublime in the idea of the dynamic influence of
                    the stars, in the supposition that they are animated by reason, and, like
                    subordinate deities, exercise creative power in their appointed spheres, than in
                    the theory that they are dead, mechanically governed masses." And in a letter to
                    Buntzen, Heiberg writes: "It must be allowed that the Middle Ages, with their
                    alchemistic and astrological superstitions, which, albeit superstitions, were
                    based upon a belief in the unity of nature and mind ... possessed more of the
                    _true scientific spirit than the present day_, with its deliberate renunciation
                    of the one thing which in the long run is of any account." In the same strain
                    (in his essay on Hveen) he praises astrology, as "based upon the profound
                    mysticism of the Middle Ages." When even Heiberg could praise Tycho Brahe for
                    his astrological bias, can we wonder that Grundtvig defended his hypothesis of
                    the earth being the centre of the universe? O Romanticism! Romanticism!</p>
                <p>The Romanticists aimed at founding a philosophy and a literature upon want and
                    longing--that is to say, upon the idea of the infinite importance of the
                    individual. The man who bases his philosophy of life upon want is certainly more
                    reasonable than the man who bases it upon either present happiness or the
                    pleasures and bliss of a future existence; for all the happiness we know is
                    undermined by sorrow and by insufficiency, and thus it is on the whole better
                    and safer to build upon want and desire. But the Romanticists do not build upon
                    desire alone, but also upon its satisfaction; they yearn, they wander about in
                    longing quest of the "blue flower," which beckons to them from afar.</p>
                <p>Longing, however, is inactivity, is nourished and thrives upon inactivity. He who
                    has left the Romantic philosophy behind him will not base his life upon such a
                    foundation.</p>
                <p>Longing engenders the impotent wish. But the Romantic wish is so instinct with
                    genius, that its fulfilment is permitted--in the Romantic world. What desire
                    promises, life fulfils. Fortune comes to the genuine Romantic hero while he
                    sleeps. Romantic literature consequently leaves the simple-minded reader with
                    the impression of a world where everything comes to those who know how to long
                    and to desire ardently enough, where all hindrances are swept aside without
                    labour, without understanding, without trouble.</p>
                <p>It is eternally true that we long; and it is no less true that we must build upon
                    something certain. Amidst all the uncertainty, insecurity, and doubt wherewith
                    we are surrounded, there is one thing certain, one thing which cannot be
                    explained away, and that is suffering. And equally certain is the good of the
                    alleviation of suffering and of release from it. It is certain that it is
                    extremely disagreeable to endure pain, to be fettered, or to be imprisoned; and
                    it is equally certain that it is a great relief to be cured, to have one's
                    fetters loosed, one's prison door flung wide open. _Hic Rhodus, hic salta_! Here
                    is a deed to be done, a stroke to be struck for liberty. We may wander about,
                    full of uncertainty and doubt, not knowing what to believe or what to do; but
                    from the moment we come upon a fellow-being with his fingers jammed in some
                    heavy door that has shut upon them, there is no longer any doubt what we have to
                    do. We must try to open the door and release the hand.</p>
                <p>And, fortunately or unfortunately, it so happens that there are always plenty of
                    human beings whose hands are caught fast, plenty who suffer, plenty who sit in
                    all manner of chains--chains of ignorance, of dependence, of stupidity, of
                    slavery. To free these must be the object of our lives. The Romanticist
                    egotistically pursues his personal happiness, and believes himself to be of
                    infinite importance. The child of the new age will neither scan the heavens in
                    search of his star nor the far horizon in search of the "blue flower." Longing
                    is inactivity. He will act. He will understand what Goethe meant by making
                    Wilhelm Meister end his life as a physician.</p>
                <p>If it is impossible to found a satisfactory philosophy of life upon longing, it
                    is equally impossible to found upon it a literature which has any connection
                    with life, and which is capable of satisfying in the long run. The task of
                    literature in all ages is to give a condensed representation of the life of a
                    people and an age. Romanticism contemptuously refused this task. Novalis in
                    Germany and Shack Staffeldt in Denmark present the most typical examples of the
                    manner in which it turned its back on outward reality, to create a
                    poetico-philosophic system out of the mind and the poetical longing of the
                    author. It does not represent human life in all its breadth and depth, but the
                    dreams of a few highly intellectual individuals. The cloud-city of Aristophanes,
                    with its air-castles, is the sacred city and goal of its longing.</p>

                    a thousand thoughts and greetings. I may not give her my flowers; she is too

                <head>ARNIM AND BRENTANO</head>
                <p>Herder's _Stimmen der Völker_ ("Voices of the Nations"), published in 1767,
                    contained only twenty German "Volkslieder;" but at the time he brought it out,
                    he expressed the wish that he might live to see the publication of a large
                    collection of the old "Nationallieder," as he called them. In 1806 L. A. von
                    Arnim and Clemens Brentano published the first volume of _Des Knaben
                    Wunderhorn_; it contained 210 German popular songs and ballads, and was followed
                    in 1808 by two more volumes of about the same size. This book was not only of
                    the greatest historical interest, but was epoch-making in German lyric poetry
                    and German literature generally. It struck that natural note which for many
                    years gave freshness and sonority to both the Romantic and the ante-Romantic
                    lyric poetry. Even when, in the case of Heine, the entirely modern had
                    supplanted the Romantic theme, rhythm and form and many hardly noticeable turns
                    of expression owed their simple charm to the inspiration of the Volkslied. The
                    superiority of German to French lyric poetry in this century possibly lies
                    chiefly in that absence of everything rhetorical which it owes to the influence
                    of Des Knaben Wunderhorn.</p>
                <p>Though the two publishers of this great collection were of one accord in their
                    love for the old popular poetry of their country, and also as to the slightly
                    modernised and carefully expurgated form in which the songs were to appear, and
                    though both were thorough-going Romanticists in principle, they were men of very
                    different characters.</p>
                <p>Ludwig Achim von Arnim was born in Berlin in 1781. He studied natural science for
                    some time in Göttingen, and then travelled all over Germany, to make himself
                    acquainted with the country and the people and to collect popular songs and
                    ballads. After this he settled for a time in Heidelberg, where he met Clemens
                    Brentano and Görres. In company with them, in 1808, he started a literary
                    periodical, the Einsiedlerzeitung ("Hermit's Chronicle"), amongst the
                    contributors to which were Tieck, Uhland, Hölderlin, and Jacob Grimm. This
                    periodical he continued at a later time under the title _Trösteinsamkeit_
                    ("Consolation in Solitude").</p>
                <p>In 1811 he married Brentano's sister, the famous Bettina, and thenceforward lived
                    partly in Berlin and partly on his estate of Wiepersdorf in Brandenburg. He kept
                    his Romanticism out of his private life; he was a sane, healthy human being, a
                    clever farmer, a sober Protestant and Prussian. Eichendorff describes him as
                    follows: "Handsome and distinguished looking, frank, ardent, and yet gentle,
                    honourable and reliable in all things, faithful to his friends even when every
                    one else deserted them, Arnim was in reality what others, by dint of a sort of
                    mediæval polish, strove to appear--a knightly figure in the best sense of the
                    word; but for this very reason it always seemed to his contemporaries that there
                    was something strange and out of place about him."</p>
                <p>Something strange there must certainly have been in his nature, for, staid and
                    sober, calm and harmonious as was his life, his writings give us the impression
                    of restlessness and complexity. He himself was cast in one piece, his works
                    never are.</p>
                <p>Besides plays, now unreadable, he wrote two long novels and a number of short
                    tales, which all bear witness to the fantast in him. The epithet "fantast" may
                    be equally suitably applied to Brentano. The first conspicuous difference
                    between the two is, that, whereas Brentano's strength lies in his naïveté and
                    his childlike fancies, Arnim is profoundly serious even in his wildest flights.
                    With all his love for the popular, with all his eagerness to open the eyes of
                    the cultured to the beauty of the simple and childlike, he remained the
                    dignified aristocrat in his own writings; he never let himself go as Brentano
                    did. When his muse has a paroxysm of madness, it is cold, almost severe
                    insanity, not a fiery, merry frenzy, like that to which Brentano's muse is
                    subject.</p>
                <p>His power of plastic representation was great, but quickly exhausted. It shows to
                    advantage in some of his short stories, and in some still shorter fragments of
                    his long novels; but along with descriptions and figures which evince real
                    talent, we are presented with a mass of padding--diffuse digressions from the
                    subject, interpolated tales which have little or no connection with the tale
                    proper, fantastic, impossible episodes, against which even the reader with the
                    most undeveloped sense of realism must protest. Sometimes he lays the whole
                    stock of popular superstitions under contribution, treating them with the utmost
                    seriousness--clay figures are magically endowed with life; a mandrake develops
                    into Field-Marshal Cornelius Nepos. At other times he has recourse to the
                    stock-in-trade of the old-fashioned romances--fabulous parentage, recovery of
                    long-lost children, disguises, strange meetings after the lapse of many years.
                    He is also given to introducing ballads and songs, generally under the rather
                    flimsy pretext that they are the composition of one or other of his characters:
                    fluent, but not melodious, they interrupt the course of the action, momentarily
                    attract the attention of the reader, and are immediately forgotten.</p>
                <p>Arnim's principal novel with a modern plot, _Armuth, Reichthum, Schuld und Busse
                    der Gräfin Dolores: Eine wahre Geschichte zur lehrreichen Unterhaltung armer
                    Fräulein aufgeschrieben_ ("Poverty, Wealth, Sin, and Penance of Countess
                    Dolores: A True Story, Recorded for the Instruction and Amusement of Poor Young
                    Ladies"), is, taken as a whole, quite as tedious as its title. This novel is
                    another of _Wilhelm Meister's_ progeny. It describes the inner life of gifted
                    and distinguished individuals of very varied character, in very varied
                    circumstances. But there is a smooth, pious strain throughout the whole, which
                    is altogether unlike _Wilhelm Meister_.</p>
                <p>The story opens with a description of a castle which has fallen almost into ruins
                    because of its owner's poverty. This description is striking and good; it has
                    its counterpart in French literature in the picture of the Chateau de la Misère
                    in Th. Gautier's _Capitaine Fracasse_. We are made to feel all the melancholy
                    associated with the idea of former grandeur and present decay. The somewhat
                    frivolous and selfish character of the penniless young Countess Dolores is also
                    drawn with a masterly hand. This lady succeeds in engaging the affections of a
                    distinguished and rich young man, Count Karl, who falls passionately in love
                    with her and marries her, after overcoming various outward and inward
                    difficulties. In the character of Count Karl, Arnim has succeeded in doing what
                    had perhaps never been done in German literature before, namely, depicting what
                    the English call a _perfect gentleman_, a conception for which other nations
                    have no corresponding expression. A _gentleman_ is a man of honour, manly,
                    serious, born to command; he is, moreover, a good Christian, conscientious,
                    unselfish, the protector of those around him, not only good by natural
                    disposition, but moral on principle. In this character Arnim seems to have
                    embodied much of what was best in his own nature. Unfortunately he did not
                    succeed in imparting to it sufficient life; a kind of dream-haze surrounds this
                    man of fine feelings, who is always writing verses and who talks a language
                    inspired by the spirit of romance.</p>
                <p>The plot turns upon the seduction of the young Countess. She is ensnared by a
                    Spanish duke, who, under a false name and title, gains admission to the house,
                    flatters her vanity in every possible way, and gradually, by the help of
                    magnetism and romantic mysticism, gains complete influence over her, and
                    persuades her that he has some mysterious connection with higher, nay, actually
                    with divine, powers. It seems almost as if Arnim must have had Zacharias Werner
                    in his mind when he drew this character. In Werner's writings we have exactly
                    this same mixture of impudent lust and sanctimonious mystery; and we know that
                    with Werner's mother it became a fixed idea that she was the Virgin Mary and her
                    son the Saviour of the world. We come upon a similar idea in the following
                    somewhat ineffective description of the seduction of Dolores:--</p>
                <p>"The Marquis looked up to the sky with an inspired gaze, held up his hands, and
                    appeared to salute some superior being. He said something, but she could not
                    hear what it was, and anxiously asked what he saw. He answered that he saw the
                    blessed Virgin, that she was pressing her, Dolores, to his breast and placing a
                    crown of roses on her head, saying: 'Follow me!' Dolores, startled, went close
                    up to him, imagining that she felt herself pushed towards him; she felt his
                    breath, imagined it to be the divine breath, and cried: 'I feel her, I feel her
                    breath; it is warm as the sun of the East and as a mother's love.' Upon this,
                    exclaiming: 'And I am her son!' he seized her in his arms, trembling
                    convulsively. He had often talked to her before of a wonderful renewal of the
                    holy myth; she seemed almost unconscious as she stammered the words: 'Yes, it is
                    thou, the all-powerful, the most holy--who hast been given to me in the weakness
                    of our human nature.' 'And thou,' he sobbed, 'art my eternal bride.'"</p>
                <p>It would almost seem as though it had been Arnim's intention to describe with the
                    aid of these fictitious characters, the mystic-sensual debaucheries of one of
                    his fellow Romanticists, a Werner or a Brentano. He himself was almost the only
                    one of the school who, in spite of the poetic attraction of Catholicism,
                    remained all his life a staunch Protestant. He seems to be attempting to explain
                    exactly that species of piety which mixed itself up with the licentiousness of
                    his Romantic contemporaries when he gives the following diagnosis of the
                    character of the hypnotising seducer: "We are not justified in altogether
                    doubting the piety of this nobleman, which to his truly pious wife seemed so
                    real. He too possessed the religious instinct; and it was Clelia's natural piety
                    which attracted him to her, though the attraction did not last long....
                    Afterwards superstitious fear took possession of him. He had outlived his vices.
                    It was now not merely his religious instinct which impelled him to visit all the
                    places of pilgrimage in Sicily and all the famous priests; he was deluding
                    himself into the piety which in his wife was genuine. It was a new stimulant,
                    the strength of which he was obliged constantly to increase. Religion was to him
                    a kind of opium; his nature craved for more and more of it, till all craving was
                    at an end." (Gräfin Dolores, ii. 136, &amp;c.)</p>
                <p>But it is not only the excesses peculiar to the Romanticists which Arnim
                    reprehends; he also sharply and wittily castigates the anti-Romanticist, Jens
                    Baggesen. In Heidelberg, where he must have met Arnim, Baggesen had written a
                    series of satirical sonnets directed against the Romanticists, "literary
                    sansculottes on the German Parnassus," as he called them. These he published in
                    the same year that _Dolores_ appeared, under the title, _Der Karfunkel- oder
                    Klingklingel-Almanack, ein Taschenbuch für vollendete Romantiker und angehende
                    Mystiker auf das Jahr der Gnade_ 1810. It was, however, undoubtedly less
                    Baggesen's verses than his extraordinary instability of character which provoked
                    Arnim's satire. The life of this enemy of Romanticism was more planless and
                    capricious than the life of any one of the Romanticists; and Arnim, for whom
                    everything strange and improbable had an attraction, could not fail to be
                    interested in such a singular personality. In _Dolores_ he caricatures him
                    wittily and mercilessly in the person of the poet "Waller." But though, in this
                    instance, the weaknesses of a special individual are caricatured, Arnim's
                    general purpose unmistakably is to throw into salient relief characteristics
                    which exemplify the lawlessness and levity of the emotional life of a whole
                    generation.</p>
                <p>His unfinished historical novel, _Die Kronenwächter_ ("The Guardians of the
                    Crown"), published in 1817, presents us, like _Dolores_, with several
                    well-conceived and ably elaborated characters along with a mass of undigested
                    mystic and lyric material. In the background of this tale looms a huge,
                    mysterious, enchanted castle, the seven towers of which are absolutely
                    transparent; they appear to be built of glass, for each of them projects a
                    brilliant rainbow upon black rocks and upon distant water. In this castle the
                    guardians of the crown of the Hohenstaufens have their lonely retreat, and hence
                    they sally forth into the world, to act and to avenge. But it is not this
                    mystical background which is of importance. What one really remembers are one or
                    two characters portrayed with such virile force as probably no German author has
                    exhibited since, unless it be Gottfried Keller, in his historical novels.</p>
                <p>We have, for example, the hero's foster-mother, Frau Hildegard, to whom we are
                    thus amusingly introduced at the beginning of the book:--"Martin, the new tower
                    watchman, has to-day married his predecessor's widow, because she has grown too
                    stout to come down the narrow corkscrew stair. We really could not pull the
                    tower down for her sake, so she had to make up her mind to this marriage, though
                    she would have preferred our clerk, Berthold. The priest has had to tie the knot
                    up there." This story of the widow's corpulence is of course nonsense, but none
                    the less it makes a very original beginning to the book.</p>
                <p>The action passes in the days of Luther, and Luther's figure is seen in the
                    background. It is rare to find a Romanticist writing of him with such warmth as
                    this:--"As a mountain sends out streams to the east and to the west, so this man
                    combined opposites, things that in others are never found together--humility and
                    pride, conviction of the path he was bound to tread and willing acceptance of
                    the advice of others, clear understanding and blind faith."</p>
                <p>A prominent part in the action is taken by Dr. Faust, the Faustus of popular
                    legend, the famous doctor and alchemist. He is represented with a fiery red
                    face, white hair, and bald crown, wearing scarlet trunk hose and ten orders. He
                    is half-genius, half-charlatan, and works miraculous cures.</p>
                <p>The most beautifully drawn character is that of a woman, the hero's betrothed,
                    Anna Zähringer, daughter of Apollonia, the love of his youth. She is the tall
                    German maiden of powerful build and noble carriage, but she also possesses the
                    sensuous attraction which Gottfried Keller has a special faculty of imparting to
                    his young women. The hero of the story, Berthold, the burgomaster, is another
                    personification of Arnim's personal ideal. He is of noble descent, but having
                    grown up in humble circumstances, is simple and plain in all his ways, a good,
                    upright, quiet citizen. Yet all the time he is at heart an aristocrat, who longs
                    for armour and weapons and tournaments, and who actually, without previous
                    training, wins the prize in the first tournament in which he takes part.</p>
                <p>Mystic incidents are, of course, not lacking. If Arnim could not forego them in
                    his modern novel, in which we read of a priest who, with one look, imparted to
                    childless wives the power of conception, they were certain to occur much more
                    frequently, and to be of an even more surprising nature, in a tale of times long
                    past. Faust, for instance, cures Berthold by injecting into his veins some of
                    the blood of a stalwart young man, Anton by name, and ever after this, Berthold
                    has the feeling that Anton has somehow acquired a right of possession in his,
                    Berthold's, lady-love, Anna; and Anton himself immediately feels mysteriously
                    attracted to Anna. _Die Kronenwächter_, like all Arnim's longer productions, is
                    a piece of patchwork, though it must be allowed that the patchwork does not lack
                    poetic value.</p>
                <p>It was only in his short tales that he succeeded in producing the effect of
                    unity. _Philander_ is a clever and pleasing imitation of the style of
                    Moscherosch, a writer who lived in the days of the Thirty Years' War. In _Fürst
                    Ganzgott und Sänger Halbgott_, we have a humorous variation of the favourite
                    Romantic "Doppelgänger" theme, based upon an extraordinary likeness between two
                    half-brothers who do not know each other; the story is at the same time a
                    travesty of the stiffness and burdensome conventions of small courts. But
                    Arnim's best and most characteristic work is the short tale, _Der tolle Invalide
                    auf dem Fort Ratonneau_. In it we have all his quaint extravagance, without any
                    breach of the laws of possibility; and the central idea is touchingly human.</p>
                <p>The story, like most of Arnim's, has a whimsically grotesque introduction. The
                    old Commandant of Marseilles, Count Durande, is sitting in the evening by his
                    crackling fire, shoving olive branches into the flames with his wooden leg, and
                    dreaming of the construction of new kinds of fireworks, when he suddenly awakens
                    to the fact that his leg is on fire. He shouts for help, and a strange woman,
                    who is in the act of entering the room, rushes up to him and attempts to stifle
                    the flames with her apron; the burning wooden leg sets fire to the apron, but
                    the two are saved by people rushing in from the street with buckets of water.
                    The woman's errand is to present a petition on behalf of her husband, whose
                    behaviour has been peculiar ever since he received a wound in the head. He is a
                    most capable, deserving sergeant, only at times so irritable that it is
                    impossible to get on with him. Partly out of compassion, partly because the case
                    interests him, the Commandant gives this sergeant charge of a fort which only
                    requires a garrison of three men, where, therefore, he runs no great danger of
                    falling out with those about him.</p>
                <p>Hardly has he entered the fort before he has an attack of furious madness; he
                    turns out his good wife, refuses to admit his two subordinates, declares war
                    against the Commandant, and opens fire upon Marseilles from his high,
                    inaccessible nest upon the cliffs. For three days he keeps the town in a state
                    of terror. Preparations are made for the storming of the fort, in spite of the
                    certain prospect of loss of life and the fear that the madman may blow up the
                    powder magazine. His brave wife, who loves him, mad as he is, begs that she may
                    first be allowed to try to get into the fort, and, if possible, disarm her
                    husband. He fires upon her, but, led by her love, she climbs undismayed up the
                    narrow rocky path at the top of which two loaded cannons face her. And now, as
                    the result of this terrible excitement, the old wound in the madman's head
                    bursts open again; he comes to his senses, totters to meet his wife--he and she
                    and the town are saved.</p>
                <p>The effect of this little work is rather weakened by the introduction of
                    supernatural agencies; the whole calamity, namely, is explained to be the result
                    of a stepmother's foolish curse; still, the story in its simplicity is a
                    glorification of that strong, beautiful love which has power to drive out even
                    the devil himself.</p>
                <p>And in this, as in several of his other tales, Arnim evinces a humane sympathy
                    with the lower classes which becomes the aristocratic Romanticist well. It is
                    the same feeling of affection for those who are simple of heart as that which
                    led him to collect and publish the popular songs and ballads, and which finds
                    expression in _Dolores_ in the following words of the hero: "I swear to you that
                    often, when I had to pay a couple of thalers for a few lines containing some
                    utterly superfluous formality, I felt a furious desire to take up the inkpot and
                    knock in the lawyer's teeth with it. I should not have been the least surprised
                    to see a flash of lightning come straight from heaven and burn up all his musty
                    documents. And if I feel thus, how much more grievous must such an outlay seem
                    to the poor man who has perhaps to work a whole week from morning till late at
                    night to scrape the money together." We come on this same idea again in his
                    essay _Von Volksliedern_, where he declares that the people have come "to look
                    on the law as they look upon a hurricane, or any other superhuman power, against
                    which they must defend themselves, or from which they must hide, or which leaves
                    them nothing to do but despair."</p>
                <p>His aristocratic bias is perceptible in all his Romantic vagaries.</p>
                <p>With Arnim's name is always coupled that of Clemens Brentano (1778-1849), his
                    partner in the work of collecting and publishing the German popular songs and
                    ballads. Brentano resembles Arnim in his habit of giving free rein to a vivid
                    imagination, but differs from him in being an unstable, unreliable personality.
                    His talent is more sparkling and supple, he is more of an intellectual prodigy;
                    but it is as a psychological phenomenon that he awakens our interest, not as a
                    man. His only claim upon our sympathy is, that he does not, like his spiritual
                    kinsman, Zacharias Werner, degrade himself by sentimental obscenity. He does not
                    act basely, but he is never truthful in the strictest sense of the word, until,
                    intellectually dulled, he renounces the calling of poet, or even of author, and
                    lives entirely for his religious enthusiasms. His case has a certain resemblance
                    to that of Hölderlin, who became insane at such an early age--the last
                    twenty-five years of his life are lost to literature.</p>
                <p>In his young days Brentano is the jester of the Romanticists, the wayward knave
                    and wag who cannot refrain from doing what he knows will cost him the friends he
                    has made, nor from disturbing and destroying the emotions and illusions which he
                    himself has skilfully produced. With the quality, rare among the Romanticists,
                    of grace in art, he combines a certain simple pathos. Like many other men of
                    productive intellect, when he took pen in hand he became more profound, more
                    serious, and, above all, more warm-hearted than he was in real life. Hence he
                    not unfrequently as an artist produces the impression of genuineness, though he
                    was insincere as a man.</p>
                <p>As an intellectual personality he had no backbone. Destitute of firm convictions,
                    he could only conceive of two attitudes towards the principle of authority in
                    matters of belief--wild revolt or unqualified submission. His intellect
                    oscillated between these two extremes until it found rest in submission.</p>
                <p>Of all his gifts and capacities, he, the arch-Romanticist, had only sought to
                    develop that of imagination. Palpably true is the following confession extracted
                    from one of his letters: "Oh, my child! we had nourished nothing but
                    imagination, and it, in return, had half devoured us." Unbridled imagination,
                    developed without any counterbalancing quality, is distinctly akin to mendacity;
                    and, as a matter of fact, Brentano in his youth was an incorrigible liar, whose
                    favourite amusement it was to move ladies to tears by accounts of his entirely
                    imaginary woes.</p>
                <p>He was the _enfant perdu_ of the Romantic School. He might also be called the
                    prodigal son of poetry. Like the young man in the New Testament, he was a
                    spendthrift. He squandered all the many good and witty ideas that occurred to
                    him, all the fertile situations which he invented, upon works destitute of
                    definite plan and form, and consequently destitute of the power to withstand
                    time, which so soon sweeps away everything formless. Before he was forty he had
                    exhausted his intellectual capital, had squandered his substance, and was fain,
                    like the young man of the Bible, "to fill his belly with the husks that the
                    swine did eat"--the husks that were the food of only ignorant and superstitious
                    human beings. In other words, he relapsed into foolish bigotry. In the year 1817
                    he began to go to confession again, as in the days of his earliest youth, and in
                    the following year withdrew from all intercourse with his fellows, to pass the
                    next six years of his life in devout contemplation by the sick-bed of the nun,
                    Catharina Emmerich, who bore on her body the marks of the wounds of Christ. He
                    regarded the bodily infirmities of this pious, single-minded, but perfectly
                    hysterical girl, as so many wonderful signs of grace, believed in the
                    miraculousness of the supposed imprints of the Saviour's wounds, and with
                    awe-strick'en compassion watched them bleed from time to time. Catharina's words
                    convinced him that she possessed a mysterious, supernatural gift of
                    second-sight, and he carefully noted down every one of her visions and
                    hallucinations. He wrote the story of her life, edited her reflections, and
                    wrote to her dictation _The Life of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary_. After her
                    death, which happened in 1824, practically his only occupation was the preparing
                    for publication of the fourteen volumes of manuscript containing her various
                    utterances.</p>
                <p>Brentano's life is a remarkable exemplification of the truth of the words of
                    Mephistopheles in Goethe's _Faust_:--</p>
                <p> "Verachte nur Vernunft und Wissenschaft, Des Menschen aller höchste Kraft, Lass
                    nur in Blend- und Zauberwerken Dich von dem Lügengeist bestärken, So hab' ich
                    dich schon unbedingt."[1]</p>
                <p>Hallucinations and magic played no small part in his existence, and the man who
                    had begun by sneering at rationalism as dull and barren, fell a prey to ideas
                    far duller and more barren than the emptiest rationalism. He was no more a
                    hypocrite than the good soul, Catharina Emmerich, was an impostor. But the
                    craving for some firm, external support for his weak, wavering Ego, now still
                    farther enfeebled by remorse for the recklessness of his youth, led him to cling
                    with all the fanatical enthusiasm of his soul to the Church and its miracles,
                    just as he had clung in earlier days to poetry with its fairy-tales and
                    magic.</p>
                <p>In his later years he was possessed by a kind of religious mania, though on a
                    rare occasion he showed a trace of his old inclination to waggery. He declared,
                    for instance, that he had drawn the apostles who appeared to Catharina Emmerich
                    in her visions exactly as she had described them to him; but Bettina discovered
                    that he had been unable to resist hanging round the apostle Paul's neck, in lieu
                    of a scrip, a curious old tobacco pouch, which had belonged to himself in former
                    days, and about which many funny stories were in circulation among his
                    acquaintances.</p>
                <p>On his father's side Clemens Brentano was of Italian descent. His grandfather, a
                    successful Frankfort merchant, was a native of Tremezzo on the Lake of Como.
                    Through his mother he was descended from the authoress Sophie Laroche, Wieland's
                    friend.</p>
                <p>In personal appearance he was the popular ideal poet, handsome, pale, and slight,
                    with a confusion of curly black hair. He had a Southern complexion and
                    sparkling, restless brown eyes shadowed by long lashes. His voice was deep and
                    beautiful, and he was fond of singing his own songs, accompanying himself on the
                    guitar.</p>
                <p>He was apprenticed to a merchant, but the experiment proved totally unsuccessful,
                    and in 1797 he went to Jena, where he made the acquaintance of the most famous
                    of the Romanticists, Fr. Schlegel, Steffens, and others. These friends often
                    threatened to thrash him for his mad tricks and "not unfrequently malicious
                    boasts and lies," and the threat was more than once actually carried out. But he
                    could not refrain from offending; it was impossible to him to restrain a
                    caprice. While still quite young, he fell in love with a very gifted woman,
                    Sophie Mereau, wife of one of the Jena professors. In the course of this love
                    affair the couple had many wonderful adventures, some of which we find
                    reproduced in his first book, _Godwi, or the Mother's Statue_. When, in 1802,
                    Fr. Tieck executed a marble bust of Brentano, Frau Mereau described the
                    impression it produced on her in the following beautiful sonnet, inspired by
                    genuine admiration and love:--</p>
                <p> "Welch süsses Bild erschuf der Künstler hier? Von welchem milden Himmelsstrich
                    erzeuget? Nennt keine Inschrift seinen Namen mir, Da diese todte Lippe ewig
                    schweiget?</p>
                <p> Nach Hohem loht im Auge die Begier, Begeistrung auf die Stirne niedersteiget, Um
                    die, nur von der schönen Locken Zier Geschmücket, noch kein Lorbeerkranz sich
                    beuget.</p>
                <p> Ein Dichter ist es. Seine Lippen prangen Von Lieb' umwebt, mit wunderselgem
                    Leben, Die Augen gab ihm sinnend die Romanze!</p>
                <p> Und schalkhaft wohnt der Scherz auf seinen Wangen; Den Namen wird der Ruhm ihm
                    einstens geben, Das Haupt ihm schmückend mit dem Lorbeerkranze."[2]</p>
                <p>Happiness came to Brentano before fame. In 1803 he married Sophie Mereau, who had
                    been divorced from her husband, and they lived most happily together till 1806,
                    when she died in childbirth.</p>
                <p>In Heidelberg Brentano collaborated with Arnim in the publication of _Des Knaben
                    Wunderhorn_ and with Görres in _Die Geschichte des Uhrmachers BOGS_ ("Story of
                    Bogs, the Watchmaker"). He had already published several works on his own
                    account--_Ponce de Leon, die lustigen Musikanten_ ("The Merry Musicians"),
                    _Chronika eines fahrenden Schülers_ ("Chronicles of a Roving Student"). In
                    Frankfort he became entangled in a love affair, which led to one of the many
                    tragi-comic episodes in his life. He ran away with a young girl who had fallen
                    violently in love with him, Auguste Busmann, a niece of the famous banker,
                    Bethmann. They went to Cassel, where he married her. It is said that he tried to
                    escape from her on the way to church, but that the energetic bride held him
                    fast. A few days after the ceremony she threw her wedding-ring out of the
                    window. One of her fancies was to dash through the town on horseback, the long
                    plumes of her hat and the scarlet trappings of her horse floating in the wind.
                    She plagued her husband in many ways. We are told that one of the worst tortures
                    he had to endure was caused by her skill in beating a tattoo with her feet
                    against the footboard of the bed, a performance invariably followed by a skilful
                    _pizzicato_ played with her toe-nails upon the sheet.[3] This and other things
                    grew so unendurable that he ran away. The valiant lady procured a divorce the
                    same year, and was ere long married again.</p>
                <p>Brentano settled in Berlin, and was soon in great request in social circles
                    there, on account of his powers of conversation, his whimsicality, and his
                    rocket-like sallies of wit. It was in Berlin that he wrote his fairy-tales and
                    most of his _Romanzen vom Rosenkranz_ ("Romances of the Rosary"). His play, _The
                    Founding of Prague_, was written in Bohemia, where lay the family estate,
                    Bukowan, of which the younger brother, Christian, took charge. After his return
                    to Berlin in 1816, he wrote the famous tale, _Geschichte vom braven Kasperl und
                    der schönen Nannerl_ ("Story of Brave Kasperl and Fair Nannerl"), also _Die
                    mehreren Wehmüller_, and _Die drei Nüsse_ ("The Three Nuts"). Then his
                    conversion took place, and he no longer lived for literature. The profits of
                    anything he wrote subsequently were devoted to charitable objects.</p>
                <p>Steffens remarks of Brentano that he is the only one of the Romanticists who
                    seems to be thoroughly aware that he has no aim. He calls him an ironical,
                    sportive Kronos, who fantastically demolishes every one of his definite
                    utterances by means of its successor, in this manner devouring his own children.
                    Still, as a lyric poet, a writer of fairy-tales, and a novelist, Brentano has
                    produced works of art, few in number, but of permanent value.</p>
                <p>In his poetry there is something touching, simple, and caressingly sweet. He
                    understands the art of condensing an emotion, but he generally dilutes it again,
                    and spoils his effect by repetitions, refrains, or the introduction of
                    inarticulate sounds, such as "Ru, ku, ku, kuh," and the like. Almost all his
                    poems contain single verses of great excellence, but almost all are too long. He
                    has appropriated the diffuseness of the Volkslied. He is distinctly original in
                    such untranslatable verses as the following, taken from the _Dichters
                    Blumenstrauss_ ("Poet's Garland"):--</p>
                <p> "Ein verstimmend Fühlgewächschen Ein Verlangen abgewandt, Ein erstarrend
                    Zitterhexchen, Zuckeflämmchen, nie verbrannt.</p>
                <p> Offnes Räthsel, nie zu lösen, Steter Wechsel, fest gewöhnt, Wesen, wie noch
                    keins gewesen, Leicht verhöhnt und schwer versöhnt. * * * * * * * * Auf dem
                    Kehlchen wiegt das Köpfchen, Blumenglöckchen auf dem Stiel, Seelchen, selig
                    Thaueströpfchen, Das hinein vom Himmel fiel."</p>
                <p>The highly artificial style of this poem is very characteristic of Brentano. Both
                    as lyric poet and story-teller he is artificial; but his mannerism seldom gives
                    the impression of affectation, it only witnesses to the almost morbid
                    sensibility of his temperament.</p>
                <p>In _Der Spinnerin Lied_ we have a simple and touching expression of the pain of
                    the long separation from Sophie Mereau. It begins:--</p>
                <p> "Es sang vor langen Jahren Wohl auch die Nachtigall, Das war wohl süsser Schall,
                    Da wir zusammen waren.</p>
                <p> Ich sing und kann nicht weinen, Und spinne so allein Den Faden klar und rein, So
                    lang der Mond wird scheinen.</p>
                <p> Da wir zusammen waren, Da sang die Nachtigall, Nun mahnet mich ihr Schall Dass
                    du von mir gefahren.</p>
                <p> So oft der Mond mag scheinen Gedenk ich dein allein; Mein Herz ist klar und
                    rein, Gott wolle uns vereinen."[4]</p>
                <p>It is right to give Brentano all honour as the creator, in his ballad "Loreley,"
                    of a figure which, under the treatment of other poets, notably Heine, has become
                    so living, so truly popular, that one can hardly believe that it is not a
                    genuine legendary figure. It is wrong to do what Griesebach and Scherer have
                    done, namely, turn this praise into a depreciation of Heine's merits, credit him
                    only with the greater literary dexterity, Brentano with the greater capacity of
                    invention. It seems particularly unjust when we remember that Brentano's own
                    finest lyrics are adaptations of popular songs. Read, for example, his beautiful
                    _Es ist ein Schnitter, der heisst Tod._ The poem is to be found under the name
                    _Erntelied_ in _Des Knaben Wunderhorn_, and begins thus:--</p>
                <p> "Es ist ein Schnitter, der heisst Tod, Hat Gewalt vom höchsten Gott, Heut wetzt
                    er das Messer, Es schneid't schon viel besser, Bald wird er drein schneiden, Wir
                    müssen's nur leiden; Hüte dich, schön's Blümelein!"</p>
                <p>Brentano's lines are more polished:--</p>
                <p> "Es ist ein Schnitter, der heisst Tod, Er mäht das Korn, wenn Gott's gebot,
                    Schon wetzt er die Sense, Dass schneidend sie glänze; Bald wird er dich
                    schneiden, Du musst es nur leiden; Musst in den Erntekranz hinein; Hüte dich,
                    schönes Blümelein!"</p>
                <p>In their original form the following lines are not only simpler, but more
                    beautiful than in Brentano's version:--</p>
                <p> "Viel hundert Tausend ungezählt, Was nur unter die Sichel fällt, Ihr Rosen, Ihr
                    Liljen, Euch wird er austilgen. Auch die Kaiserkronen Wird er nicht verschonen.
                    Hüte dich, schönes Blümelein!"</p>
                <p>Brentano's run thus:--</p>
                <p> "Viel hunderttausend ohne Zahl, Ihr sinket durch der Sense Strahl; Weh' Rosen,
                    weh' Lilien, Weh' krause Basilien! Selbst euch Kaiserkronen Wird er nicht
                    verschonen. Ihr müsst zum Erntekranz hinein. Hüte dich, schönes Blümelein!"</p>
                <p>He spins out the six verses of the old song to fourteen by the aid of a long list
                    of flowers and plants; we are out of breath before we get to the end of them.
                    The volume of poems entitled _Die Romanzen vom Rosenkranz_ ("Romances of the
                    Rosary") is a romantic variation of the Faust legend, showing the evil of thirst
                    for knowledge and pride of it. Faust himself is transformed into the
                    Mephistophelian evil principle. In this work, as well as in "Loreley," Brentano
                    prepares the way for Heinrich Heine. The romances are written in four-footed
                    trochees, which in their cadence and whole character anticipate Heine's trochaic
                    verse, especially in the droll juxtaposition of light, graceful lines and lines
                    consisting of learned names, obscure legal matter, and scraps of mediæval mystic
                    jargon.</p>
                <p>As a prose writer, Brentano began, with his _Godwi_, in the style of _Lucinde_.
                    The first part of the book assumes that true morality consists in allowing the
                    sensual instincts free play, and immorality in repressing or ignoring them. With
                    bacchantic wildness the heroine preaches the gospel of free love, and denounces
                    marriage and every species of compulsory virtue. The second part, in genuine
                    Romantic fashion, satirises the first part and the characters delineated in it.
                    Godwi, the hero of the first volume, retires into the background, and the author
                    himself, under the pseudonym Maria, takes his place. We learn that it was simply
                    with the view of obtaining the hand of the daughter of one of the personages in
                    the first part of the book, that the author managed to gain possession of the
                    correspondence of which that first part consists. He had hoped by publishing it
                    to attain this end. But, as the first volume is not approved of, he takes it to
                    Godwi, the principal character, and begs him to tell what other love adventures
                    he has had. The astounded Godwi reads his own story. Book in hand, he conducts
                    the author round his garden, and says, pointing to a pond: "This is the pond
                    into which I fall on page 266 of the first volume." Thus in _Godwi_ we have
                    Romantic sensual licence in combination with Romantic irony and
                    selfduplication.</p>
                <p>The revulsion from revolutionary ardour and passion was even more complete in
                    Brentano's case than in Fr. Schlegel's; it became positive renunciation of
                    reason. And his conversion, like Zacharias Werner's, was of the species
                    accompanied by a tearful conviction of sin. In his _Sketch of the Life of Anna
                    Catharina Emmerich_ he tells, without giving a thought to any possible
                    physiological explanation of the fact, that her longing for the Holy Sacrament
                    was so great, that often at night, feeling herself irresistibly drawn to it, she
                    left her cell, and was found in the morning kneeling with outstretched arms
                    outside the locked church door. It never occurred to him that her condition
                    might be a morbid one, not even when she told him all the particulars of the
                    appearance of the stigmata on her body as if the whole thing had happened to
                    another nun of the neighbourhood.</p>
                <p>But during the middle period of his literary career, Brentano produced some prose
                    works which are of more than merely historical literary interest; for example,
                    the fairy-tale, _Gockel, Hinkel, und Gackeleia_, which he first wrote in a
                    pithy, condensed form, but at a later period diluted with holy water and greatly
                    expanded. This tale gives us an idea of the inexhaustible supply of amusing and
                    grotesque conceits to which his conversation doubtless owed its great charm. In
                    it Brentano reveals himself as a master of the prose which, while playing with
                    words and ideas and connecting things which have not the remotest connection,
                    nevertheless dexterously refrains from mixing metaphors, and never breaks the
                    link in the chain of ideas. It may be a perfect trifle, some accidental
                    reminiscence (Brentano's remembering, for instance, that in his childhood he had
                    heard Goethe's mother say: "Dies ist keine Puppe, sondern nur eine schöne
                    Kunstfigur"), which sets him weaving the chain. But with the inexorable artistic
                    severity of a contrapuntist, he holds to his fugitive motive throughout the
                    whole length of his composition, varying and enriching it. As a specimen of this
                    style, take the following paragraph from _Gockel, Hinkelund Gackeleia_, that
                    tale in which, throughout several hundred pages, words and ideas undergo a
                    transformation which fits them for their place in the hen-world:--</p>
                <p>"Die Franzosen haben das Schloss so übel mitgenommen, dass sie es recht
                    abscheulich zurückliessen. Ihr König Hahnri hatte gesagt, jeder Franzose solle
                    Sonntags ein Huhn, und wenn keins zu haben sei, ein Hinkel in den Topf stecken
                    und sich eine Suppe kochen. Darauf hielten sie streng, und sahen sich überall
                    um, wie jeder zu seinem Huhn kommen könne. Als sie nun zu Haus mit den Hühnern
                    fertig waren, machten sie nicht viel Federlesens und hatten bald mit diesem,
                    bald mit jenem Nachbarn ein Hühnchen zu pflücken. Sie sahen die Landkarte wie
                    einen Speisezettel an; we etwas von Henne, Huhn oder Hahn stand, das strichen
                    sie mit rother Tinte an und giengen mit Küchenmesser und Bratspiess darauf los.
                    So giengen sie über den Hanebach, steckten Gross- und Kleinhüningen in den Topf,
                    und dann kamen his in das Hanauer Land. Als sie nun Gockelsruh, das herrliche
                    Schloss der Raugrafen von Hanau, im Walde fanden, statuirten sie ein Exempel,
                    schnitten allen Hühnern die Hälse ab, steckten sie in den Topf und den rothen
                    Hahn auf das Dach, das heisst, sie machten ein so gutes Feuerchen unter den
                    Topf, dass die lichte Lohe zum Dach herausschlug und Gockelsruh darüber
                    verbrannte. Dann giengen sie weiter nach Hünefeld und Hunhaun."</p>
                <p>This fairy-tale style, with its perpetual farcical play upon words, almost
                    reminds one of the manner in which the young men in some of Shakespeare's plays
                    give vent to their overflowing humour.</p>
                <p>Much graver, if not less mannered, is the style of Brentano's most famous story,
                    _Geschichte vom braven Kasperl und dem schönen Annerl_ ("The Story of Brave
                    Kasperl and Fair Annerl").</p>
                <p>The subject is taken from _Des Knaben Wunderhorn_. In the second volume of the
                    collection, p. 204, is to be found a short ballad, _Weltlich Recht_ ("Earthly
                    Justice"), which tells the tale of the execution of Fair Nanerl, who is glad to
                    die and go to her child:--</p>
                <p> "Der Fähndrich kam geritten und schwenket seine Fahn: 'Halt still mit der
                    schönen Nanerl, ich bringe Pardon.'</p>
                <p> 'Fähndrich, lieber Fähndrich, sie ist ja schon todt. 'Gute nacht, meine schöne
                    Nanerl, deine Seel ist bei Gott.'"[5]</p>
                <p>In Brentano's version the whole story is told in the street, on a long summer
                    evening, by a poor old woman of eighty-eight, the beautiful Annerl or Nanerl's
                    grandmother. He has been so successful in reproducing this aged, pious, and very
                    superstitious woman's language, that we seem to see her before us all the time.
                    With consummate art, he manages to keep the reader in constant suspense by the
                    erratic manner in which she tells her story, hurrying onward and then turning
                    back to catch up the thread she has let fall. We are never told enough during
                    the course of the narration to give us a clear understanding of the whole
                    position of affairs, but always enough to keep up our interest and make us
                    anxious to know the answer of the riddle, to get at the explanation of the
                    story-teller's mysterious hints. Seldom have the veils concealing a series of
                    incidents from the reader been raised so skilfully, one by one.</p>
                <p>Another of the merits of the tale is the vigour with which its main idea, honour
                    (the true and the false sense of honour, the shame of wounded pride and the real
                    shame and infamy to which ambition may lead), is presented to us and developed
                    in the actions and experiences of the two principal characters. Kasperl, the
                    brave Uhlan, whose sense of honour is so keen that it amounts to sentimental
                    weakness, is driven to despair by the dishonourable conduct of his father and
                    stepbrother. He commits suicide, and is thereby saved the anguish of knowing the
                    fate of his sweetheart, fair Annerl. Annerl's whole life has been controlled by
                    a cruel fate. The poet, in his gloomy superstition, has taken real pleasure in
                    driving her onwards to calamity and death with the irresistible, mysterious
                    power of predestination. Annerl's mother in her day had loved a huntsman. This
                    huntsman is to be executed for murder. When the child comes near the
                    executioner, his sword trembles in its scabbard--an unmistakable sign that it
                    thirsts for her blood. The huntsman's head, when it is cut off, flies towards
                    her, and the teeth grip her frock. Of the power that draws her on to wrong-doing
                    and misfortune we are constantly told: "It drew her with its teeth" ("Es hat sie
                    mit den Zähnen dazu gerissen"). Ambition leads to disgrace; Annerl is seduced by
                    a young officer under a false promise of marriage; in her anguish and madness
                    she strangles her new-born child, then gives herself up to justice and pays the
                    penalty of her crime with her young life--her seducer, the ensign, arriving too
                    late with a pardon.</p>
                <p>This epitome of the tale shows to what extent Brentano, in this particular case,
                    has done homage to the doctrines of Romanticism. Supernatural warnings play an
                    important part. The career of the heroine is regarded from the standpoint of
                    Oriental fatalism; but at the same time, and without any attempt to smooth away
                    the contradiction, we have the genuinely Catholic persuasion that a sin is being
                    punished, the sin committed by the chief character in setting the purely human
                    principle of honour above the Church's doctrine of heavenly grace. Nevertheless,
                    the little tale has both artistic style and a genuine popular ring. The spirit
                    of the popular ballad from which its theme is borrowed hovers over it. And, what
                    is still more worthy of note, it is in so far an epoch-making work in German
                    literature, that, long before the appearance of Immermann's _Der Oberhof_ it
                    heralds the age of the peasant-story, striking in its naïve if somewhat
                    artificial style the chord of which we hear the echo so long afterwards in
                    Auerbach and others.</p>
                <p>[1] "Yes, despise reason and science, the highest possessions of man, let
                    yourself be persuaded by the spirit of lies to believe in hallucinations and
                    magic, and you are mine without fail."</p>
                <p>[2] "What beautiful image is this that the artist has created? Under what genial
                    sky was this man born? Is there no inscription to tell me his name, since these
                    dead lips are dumb for ever? The eye glows with noble desire; enthusiasm shines
                    from that fair brow, surmounted only by clustering curls, not yet by the laurel
                    wreath. He is a poet. The wondrous smile of love, of life, is on his lips;
                    romance dwells in these thoughtful eyes, drollery in the cheeks' roguish curves.
                    Fame will ere long proclaim his name, and set the crown of laurel on his
                    brow."</p>

                    we were together; now she but reminds me that you have gone from me. It is of
                    you alone that I think in the moonlight; my heart is clean and strong as the

                <p>MYSTICISM IN THE ROMANTIC DRAMA</p>
                <p>There is one form of literature in which men and women are, for the most part,
                    portrayed as essentially intellectual beings, endowed with freedom of will and
                    action. That form is the drama. In lyric poetry emotion reigns; in epic the
                    character is partly lost sight of in the broad painting of the circumstances and
                    powers which determine it; but the subject of the drama is action; and because
                    the human character, acting and willing, is in itself something absolutely
                    definite, it compels the author to give clear, well-defined form to his
                    production. The drama demands lucidity and intellect; in it, where there is a
                    reason for everything, the forces of nature must be either the servants or the
                    masters of the mind; but, above all, they must be comprehended; they cannot
                    appear as dark, mysterious despots, who are not expected to give any explanation
                    of their nature or business. Tieck's two Romantic dramas, the tragedy, _Leben
                    und Tod der heiligen Genoveva_ ("Life and Death of St. Genevieve"), and the ten
                    act comedy, _Kaiser Octavianus_, are really only dramas in name. His admiration
                    of Shakespeare's _Pericles_ and _Winter's Tale_ and Calderon's lyrical and
                    musical interludes betrayed him into a lyric-epic formlessness unequalled in the
                    history of literature. It would be difficult to find dramatic works more
                    destitute of plan and style. All their author's care is lavished upon what he
                    calls the "climate" of events, their atmosphere and fragrance, tone and colour,
                    the mood they inspire, the shadow they cast, the light in which they are seen,
                    which is invariably that of the moon. His medieval characters are possessed by
                    the spirit which the study of old legends has induced in himself. It was a kind
                    of religious impression which imparted this tendency to his productivity.
                    Schleiermacher's _Reden über Religion_ ("Lectures on Religion") had had a
                    profound influence on him. He had begun to read Jakob Böhme's _Morgenröthe_
                    ("Dawn"), expecting to find it a perfect mine of absurdities, and from a scoffer
                    had turned into an enthusiastic disciple. It was about this time, too, that he
                    met Novalis and fell under his influence.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, if we read Genoveva observantly, we soon find what Tieck himself
                    admits, that its religion, the pious emotion which was intended to give it
                    artistic unity, is no more than the Romantic longing for religion. Many traces
                    of this longing are to be found in the play. The old days, the days of faith,
                    are represented as sighing, like Tieck's own, for still older, far more
                    believing days; their religion, too, is but a longing for religion. Golo says to
                    Sir Wolf, who to him represents the good old times: "How could I dream of
                    jeering at thy childlike spirit!" Genoveva looks back to the past; like Tieck
                    himself, she spends her time reading old legends. She says, with a touch of
                    genuine Romanticism:--</p>
                <p> "Drum ist es nicht so Andacht, die mich treibt, Wie inn'ge Liebe zu den alten
                    Zeiten, Die Rührung, die mich fesselt, dass wir jetzt So wenig jenen grossen
                    Gläub'gen gleichen."[1]</p>
                <p>The principal masculine character in the play, the whimpering, whining villain
                    Golo, is William Lovell over again, and William not in the least improved by
                    being dressed up as a dramatic figure in a medieval tragedy.</p>
                <p>_Octavianus_, the allegorical style of which has been strongly influenced by
                    _Heinrich von Ofterdingen_, is, if possible, still more shapeless and incoherent
                    than _Genoveva_. It strikes one as resembling nothing so much as a splendid
                    collection of samples of all kinds of metres, those of Southern as well as of
                    Northern Europe, and is in reality simply a fatiguing succession of carefully
                    elaborated descriptions of impressions produced, moods inspired, by nature.</p>
                <p>In the introduction to _Phantasus_, Tieck has himself described how all definite
                    impressions of the surrounding world blend in his mind into a sort of mystic
                    pantheism:--</p>
                <p> "Was ich für Grott' und Berg gehalten, Für Wald und Flur und Felsgestalten, Das
                    war ein einzigs grosses Haupt, Statt Haar und Bart mit Wald umlaubt. Still
                    lächelt er, dass seine Kind' In Spielen glücklich vor ihm sind Er winkt und
                    ahndungsvolles Brausen Wogt her in Waldes heil'gem Sausen. Da fiel ich auf die
                    Kniee nieder Mir zitterten in Angst die Glieder. Ich sprach zum Kleinen nur das
                    Wort: Sag an, was ist das Grosse dort? Der Kleine sprach: Dich fasst sein Graun,
                    Weil Du ihn darfst so plötzlich schaun, Das ist der Vater, unser Alter, Heisst
                    Pan, von Allem der Erhalter."[2]</p>
                <p>And Tieck looked at and apprehended human nature exactly as he looked at and
                    apprehended forest and mountain. In describing it, too, he drowns all
                    definiteness and character in the flood of mystic pantheism. And this mystic
                    pantheism in his plays paves the way for the Christian mysticism distinguishing
                    the Romantic drama.</p>
                <p>Arnim and Brentano are hardly to be taken into account as dramatists. The latter,
                    in his mad comedy, _Ponce de Leon_, the dialogue of which is loaded with
                    wearisome play upon words, is the would-be disciple of Shakespeare, who has only
                    succeeded in imitating the affectations of the master's youthful style. In his
                    great Romantic drama, _Die Gründung Prags_ ("The Founding of Prague"), he gives
                    us sorcery and miracles, visions and prophecies, magic rings and curses, instead
                    of real human beings and real action; the course of events is indicated by
                    strange forebodings and unerring second-sight.</p>
                <p>There is some resemblance between the manner in which Brentano has dramatised
                    Slavonic legend in this play, and the Polish Romanticist Slowacki's treatment
                    (in _Lilla Weneda_, for instance) of similar themes. Both, out of crude myths
                    and traditions, have produced pictures of Slavonic heathendom which display a
                    certain gift of intuition. The fact is that the Romantic authors of all lands
                    had a keener sense for religious mysticism than for dramatic truth and effect.
                    This play of Brentano's is actually declared to have influenced the mythological
                    theories of his contemporaries, the brothers Grimm.</p>
                <p>Arnim's _Halle und Jerusalem_, the "tragedy in two comedies," as he himself
                    styled it, in which the legend of the Wandering Jew is interwoven with the story
                    of Cardenio and Celinde, is one of the most intolerable productions of German
                    Romanticism. It is a reading-drama of four hundred large octavo pages, which
                    begins as a wild student's comedy in Halle, and develops into a pilgrim-mystery
                    in Jerusalem. It turns upon the medieval idea of the Holy Sepulchre being the
                    centre of the world; and it ends with an apparition of three crosses of fire
                    above the graves of the three principal characters.</p>
                <p>In one of the scenes Celinde attempts in the dead of night to cut the heart out
                    of her dead lover's breast, that with its assistance she may perform certain
                    magic rites which will ensure her possession of the heart of her living lover.
                    The dead man, the blood pouring from his breast, rises out of his coffin, and
                    complains of her treatment in such verse as:--</p>
                <p> "Geliebte, du durchbohrst mein Herz, Das ist bittrer als der Hölle
                    Schmerz."[3]</p>
                <p>Immediately after this, the sexton unmasks himself, reveals himself as the devil,
                    and carries off Celinde's wicked mother to be his bride.</p>
                <p>In another scene Celinde is supposed to be about to give birth to a child in a
                    mountain cavern. A stork appears on the stage carrying a child in its beak, and
                    flies into the cavern. Then come a whole flight of storks, which direct their
                    course southwards, singing:--</p>
                <p> "Hast du schwer am Kind getragen, Musst sie mit den Flügeln schlagen, Hast du
                    müssen lange reisen, Musst sie mit dem Schnabel beissen," &amp;c.[4]</p>
                <p>The child is born dead, and the wretched mother is in despair. This fact also is
                    communicated to us by a stork:--</p>
                <p> "In meiner Wut, In der Reiseglut, Hab ich das Kind erdrückt," &amp;c.,
                    &amp;c.[5]</p>
                <p>Immediately on the head of this follow would-be pathetic, but in reality
                    revoltingly horrible scenes, like the one entitled "The Temptation in the
                    Desert," in which Ahasuerus, the Wandering Jew, who is starving, struggles
                    against the temptation to eat a little boy, who has been saved along with
                    himself from shipwreck. Ahasuerus says: "How terrible is my desire for his
                    flesh! I already feel the juicy morsel rolling between tongue and palate...." He
                    is on the point of committing the crime, when the child cries: "Father! father!"
                    on which the old man hastily absorbs himself in his book.</p>
                <p>Almost at the end of the play, in the middle of a religious service held by the
                    Knights of the Holy Sepulchre, an attack is suddenly made upon those
                    Romanticists whose piety is not sincere. A traveller says: "I will deliver the
                    Holy Sepulchre out of the hands of the Turks." One of the author's favourite
                    characters retorts: "Do it first, and then speak of it." Hereupon follows this
                    incredibly undramatic parenthesis: "The traveller turns away ashamed; he goes
                    out into the wide world and pleads the cause of Christianity in thousands of
                    words; but his words have not the power of eternal life, for his is love without
                    deeds. From him are descended all the new, poetic Christians, those, I mean, who
                    are only Christians in their poems." When it comes the length of the author's
                    "I" appearing in a parenthesis in the middle of a play, we may regard dramatic
                    form as practically non-existent. Even Tieck and Hoffmann never went as far as
                    this.</p>
                <p>German Romanticism produced only two real dramatists--Zacharias Werner and
                    Heinrich von Kleist. Of these, the latter is incomparably the greater; indeed
                    his poetic gifts are so great that one may unhesitatingly assign him the highest
                    place among all the poets of his school. He has a clearer, more plastic style
                    than any of them, and pathos such as we do not find even in Goethe. His finest
                    works are full of soul, heart, and burning passion, and yet the style is simple
                    and lucid. Kleist is Germany's Mérimée; and a study of his characteristics will
                    show us what the German Romantic tendency could make of a Mérimée. We shall see
                    how the clearness, the definiteness, which was the natural quality of his
                    genius, was disturbed and deranged by the poetical insanity of Romanticism.</p>
                <p>Thirty steps from the Wannsee, a little lake near Berlin, and fifty from the
                    wayside inn, stands a gravestone bearing the inscription: "Heinrich von
                    Kleist."</p>
                <p>Upon this spot, on the 20th of November, 1811, at the age of thirty-four, the
                    greatest German poet of the younger generation of that day, shot, with unerring
                    aim, first the woman he loved and then himself. It was long believed that the
                    two were united simply by a calm, reasonable friendship. But when, in 1873,
                    their correspondence was published, its unhealthy passion made it evident that
                    there was extravagantly strong feeling on both sides, and that the reason of
                    both was undermined. Kleist addresses his friend, Frau Henriette Vogel, in such
                    terms as these: "My Jette, my all, my castle, land, meadows, and vineyards, sun
                    of my life, my wedding, baptism of my children, my tragedy, my fame, my guardian
                    angel, my cherub and seraph!" and she replies: "My defence, my guard, my sword,
                    my spear, my buckler, my shield," &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Heinrich von Kleist was of noble birth, the scion of an old Prussian military
                    family, which in the eighteenth century had already produced a poet. Heinrich
                    had been through one campaign, as a young ensign, when military life became
                    distasteful to him, and a dim consciousness of his unusual powers impelled him
                    to turn to study. In 1799 he matriculated at the university of his native town,
                    Frankfort-on-the-Oder, and was soon working hard at philosophy, mathematics, and
                    classics, living, in spite of his youth, a very sober life, entirely occupied
                    with his own ardent introspective thoughts. In an awkward, pedantic way he
                    attempted to educate his sister, and to cultivate the mind of his _fiancée_, so
                    that she might really understand him. In the course of a year he left Frankfort
                    to pursue his studies in Berlin. He early developed a fatal inclination to stake
                    everything on one card. His biographer, Wilbrandt, has aptly compared his
                    character to Werther's. He had Werther's gloomy dissatisfaction and cynical
                    reserve, his vivid imagination, his habit of brooding and reasoning, and of
                    dwelling upon everything painful, his overpowering outbursts of emotion.</p>
                <p>It was clear to Kleist himself that his was the poet's vocation long before he
                    dared confide the thought to his friends; he left them, he isolated himself,
                    until he was certain of his powers. When for the first time he felt the plan of
                    a work taking shape in his mind, it seemed to him as though "something like
                    earthly happiness" were smilingly beckoning him on. Impetuous and audacious, he
                    expected to produce a masterpiece at once. The immature beginner's attempt was
                    unsuccessful. When, a year later, he planned _Robert Guiscard_, the tragedy
                    which occupied his thoughts throughout the rest of his youth, it was with the
                    distinct intention of surpassing the classical works of Goethe and Schiller "by
                    the aid of a new art principle." In his art Æschylus and Shakespeare, the best
                    qualities of antiquity and the Renaissance, were to be fused together, the cult
                    of the beautiful was to be combined with truth to nature, and irreproachable
                    style with the extreme of tragic horror.</p>
                <p>His powers were as yet inadequate to the task of producing a complete work, and
                    he was obliged to lay the tragedy aside.</p>
                <p>In the discouragement produced by the failure of this attempt he turned to
                    philosophy. His desire was to find, not truths, but the truth. With the naïve
                    confidence of the self-taught man he expected to discover at once the full,
                    perfect truth which would guide him both in life and death.</p>
                <p>It was the philosophy of Kant which he set himself to study, and the impression
                    it made upon him was distinctly depressing. He had expected to find a religion
                    in philosophy, and Kant's Theory of Cognition taught him that we cannot attain
                    to the truth, can never know what things are in themselves, but only see them as
                    our own organs show them to us--that is to say, he who has green spectacles sees
                    things green, and he who has red, sees them red. When he recognised that
                    knowledge of the truth, as he had represented it to himself, was not possible,
                    it seemed to the young man as if his highest, his only aim were gone.</p>
                <p>In this state of spiritual disorganisation he, like other Romanticists, felt the
                    inclination to seek the support of a system of dogmas, either that of orthodox
                    Protestantism or that of the older and more authoritative Catholic Church. He
                    writes from Dresden: "Nothing could have been better calculated to entice me
                    away from the melancholy domain of science than the treasures of art collected
                    in this town.... But nowhere did I feel so deeply moved as in the Catholic
                    church, where the most sublime music leagues itself with the other arts to touch
                    the heart. Our divine service is nothing at all in comparison; it only appeals
                    to cold reason, but a Catholic festival appeals to all the senses.... Oh, for
                    one drop of forgetfulness! then I should with joy become a Catholic."</p>
                <p>Though he overcomes these fancies, he is unable to force himself to work, now
                    that he has made the discovery that truth is not to be found upon earth. To put
                    an end to this painful aimlessness, he determines, though with no particular
                    object in view, to go to Paris. His letters from Paris show how fruitless this
                    new attempt at discovering his real vocation in life proved. He breaks off his
                    engagement, because his _fiancée_ will not blindly and obediently follow him to
                    Switzerland, there to live the life of a peasant's wife. His pride will not
                    permit him to return to his native town before he has accomplished something in
                    the way of fulfilment of his ambitious projects. He goes to Weimar with the
                    intention of completing _Robert Guiscard_ there, is much in Wieland's society,
                    and finally takes up his abode in his house. The old man's goodness and his
                    daughter's quiet tenderness keep him there, but he remains reserved and
                    absent-minded. At last he confesses to the lovable, sympathetic old poet that he
                    is at work upon a tragedy, but that his ideal is so high that he has as yet
                    found it impossible to transfer his conception to paper.</p>
                <p>One afternoon Wieland, taking advantage of a favourable opportunity, persuaded
                    his guest to repeat some fragments of the principal scenes from memory. The old
                    poet's admiration knew no bounds; he asserted that if it were possible for the
                    spirits of Æschylus, Sophocles, and Shakespeare to combine in creating a
                    tragedy, it would be such a tragedy as _Robert Guiscard_, provided that the
                    whole fulfilled the promise of the parts he had heard.</p>
                <p>Kleist's joy was great, but short-lived. Circumstances soon unsettled him again.
                    He went first to Leipzig, then to Dresden. It was in Dresden, to a girl who was
                    in distress because of the supposed indifference of her lover, that he first
                    made the proposal (a proposal which he afterwards often repeated to friends of
                    both sexes), that he should take a pistol and shoot her and himself. Not long
                    afterwards he made a similar offer to his faithful friend, Von Pfuel. Pfuel came
                    to the conclusion that travel would be the best thing possible for Kleist and
                    his tragedy. Kleist caught eagerly at the idea. Shortly before he started for
                    Switzerland he received a letter from Wieland which gave him fresh courage, and
                    was for a long time his greatest comfort. Wieland wrote that it was impossible
                    to him to believe that any external hindrance could prevent the completion of
                    Kleist's masterpiece: "To the Holy Muse who inspires you nothing is impossible.
                    You must complete your _Guiscard_; yes, even if the whole Caucasus were weighing
                    you down."</p>
                <p>During his travels in Switzerland and Northern Italy, which occupied the summer
                    and autumn of 1803, Kleist wrote nothing. Despairing of the sufficiency of his
                    powers, coming to the conclusion that he possessed only a "half talent," he
                    temporarily gave up all idea of literary work. All the time tormented by
                    thoughts of death, he travelled by Lyons to Paris. There he burned _Guiscard_
                    and all his papers, and determined to enter the army of France (a nation he
                    hated) and take part in the great expedition preparing at Boulogne, in the
                    confident hope that the undertaking would fail, and that he and the whole army
                    would find graves in England. He tried to enlist as a common soldier, but was
                    refused. An acquaintance whom he accidentally met, put him in a position to
                    return to Germany, where, after many mishaps and disappointments, he obtained a
                    small official appointment at Königsberg.</p>
                <p>Kleist had announced his intention of competing with Goethe. "I will tear the
                    wreath from his brow," was early the burden of his confidences and his dreams.
                    It sounds like the utterance of a madman. And yet, when we read the one fragment
                    that remains to us of the never-completed drama, _Guiscard_, we are filled with
                    astonishment. It was as little within the power of this work as of any other to
                    remove the crown of honour from the brow of the genius whose spirit dominates
                    two centuries; but the fact remains that the fragment of it which we possess
                    stands on a level with much of the best produced by Goethe.</p>
                <p>Kleist has drawn on his imagination for the picture of a great man, a great
                    leader; and he at once successfully impresses us with his hero's greatness by
                    showing how much depends upon him, upon his life, how thousands upon thousands
                    look up to him as their ruler and only saviour.</p>
                <p>The great adventurer, Robert Guiscard, son of Tancred de Hauteville, is lying
                    with his army before Constantinople, which city he has vowed to take and keep.
                    But fate is against him; the plague has broken out in his camp and is committing
                    terrible ravages.</p>
                <p>Kleist himself had encountered just such overwhelming misfortune on the path of
                    victory which his imagination had painted; and his delineation of a hero
                    struggling against an overpowering destiny which he has long borne consciously
                    within himself is grand. For Guiscard himself is plague-stricken; the mortal
                    sickness is raging in his intestines; its poison is consuming his very bones. He
                    who till now has been everywhere victorious, the conqueror of Southern Italy, of
                    Rome, of Venice, and of Greece, knows, feels, that his end is at hand. A crowd
                    of Normans are besieging his tent, calling on him to lead the army away from
                    this terrible camping-ground, where they feel the poisonous breath of the plague
                    blowing in their faces. A rumour that he is ill has already begun to spread, but
                    as yet the truth is not to be divulged; Guiscard is too proud to let any one
                    know what he is suffering.</p>
                <p>His tent is thrown open, and the man in whose breast a consuming fire is burning,
                    whose throat is parched with unquenchable thirst, and whose hand is so weak that
                    all through the night he has not been able to lift it, steps forth erect and
                    proud, and shows himself to the crowd. So strong and gay and masterful does he
                    seem, that even those who before were certain of the worst, no longer know what
                    to believe.</p>
                <p>And there is profound meaning as well as grandeur in this conception of Kleist's.
                    This Guiscard, who stands there erect and unflinching while mortal disease is
                    gnawing at his vitals, who is he but Kleist himself, his whole unhappy life
                    long? He himself is the great genius whose plans are foiled by the pestilence
                    without and within him.</p>
                <p>Kleist soon resigned his Government appointment and returned to the calling of
                    literature. It is most interesting to observe the dramatic characters now
                    produced by a man in reality full of productive energy. Our study of the
                    psychological peculiarities and doctrines of the Romanticists has shown us how
                    their predilection for disintegrating personality led them to lay special weight
                    upon all that has a disintegrating effect--dreams, hallucinations, and madness.
                    What distinguishes Kleist's characters from those of the other Romanticists is
                    that there is nothing blurred and vague about them; the essential quality which
                    his and theirs have in common is morbidity. In every passion Kleist seizes upon
                    that feature which betrays kinship with the fixed idea or with helpless
                    insanity; he probes every mind, however sound, till he finds the diseased point
                    where it loses control over itself--somnambulistic tendency, overpowering animal
                    appetites, absent-mindedness, cowardice in the face of death. Take such a
                    passion as love; it is certainly not of a rational nature, but it has a side
                    from which it may be seen to be connected with reason and intellect. Kleist
                    almost invariably, and with admirable skill, depicts it as of the nature of
                    disease, as mania.</p>
                <p>When Käthchen of Heilbronn sees Count Walter von Strahl for the first time, she
                    drops everything she is carrying, food, wine, and glasses, and, pale as death,
                    with folded hands, falls at his feet as if she had been struck by lightning. The
                    Count speaks a friendly word to her. Presently, from her window, she sees him
                    mounting his horse to ride away. In her haste to follow him, she jumps from the
                    window, thirty feet high, on to the street, and breaks both her legs. Barely
                    recovered from six weeks' fever, she rises from her bed, collects a small bundle
                    of belongings, and deserts her home to seek the Count and follow him in blind
                    devotion from place to place, led "by the rays which shine from his face and
                    twine themselves round her heart like a five-stranded cord." She wanders after
                    him, her bare feet bleeding on the stony roads, her scanty skirt fluttering in
                    the wind, a straw hat her only protection against the heat of the sun and the
                    pelting of the rain. Through mountain mists, across desert tracts scorched by
                    the sun, through the darkness of thick forests, she follows, like a dog on its
                    master's track; and she, who had been accustomed to lay her head on soft
                    pillows, disturbed by each little knot spun inadvertently by herself into the
                    thread of the sheets, now, when night comes, sleeps in the Count's stables like
                    the meanest servant, sinking exhausted upon the straw spread for his horses.</p>
                <p>There is the ring of truth in this description, given by her father, of the young
                    girl's flight. The Count, who knows that he is in no way to blame, tries every
                    method of alienating her. Coming upon her in his stable one night, he thrusts
                    her aside with his foot, and more than once he threatens her with his dog-whip.
                    He allows her to sacrifice herself for his bride, who orders her to rush into a
                    burning house to save his miniature, and when she has brought it, sends her back
                    again for the case. With joy and deep humility she does and bears all. The more
                    refined, but weaker, representation of an overpowering, unrequited passion given
                    us by Henrik Hertz in The _House of Svend Dyring_ is modelled upon Kleist's
                    Käthchen. Side by side with much that is ridiculous and repulsive, _Käthchen von
                    Heilbronn_ contains much that is really grand. It is plain enough that this
                    passion, which comes on as suddenly as a fit of apoplexy--which, moreover, as a
                    fixed idea, destroys every other idea, and, itself a miracle, performs miracles
                    with the aid of an angel--oversteps the bounds of the natural and the healthy.
                    Yet there is something fine in it. It gave intense satisfaction to Kleist, who
                    had such a rooted aversion for mere phrases, to represent a loving woman, in
                    whom everything was truth and reality which in other women is mere words. It was
                    thus that he himself had desired to be loved by his Wilhelmine; and at a later
                    period he had demanded such excessive devotion from a young girl whose
                    acquaintance he had made at the Körners' house in Dresden, and who had become
                    attached to him, that all relations between them were broken off. Now he had
                    taken refuge with his ideal in poetry.</p>
                <p>There is something satisfying and pleasing in the realisation of the well-known
                    phrases: To see and love was one and the same thing--to follow the beloved to
                    the ends of the earth--to be more devoted to him than his dog--to go through
                    fire and water for him. But yet all this properly belongs to the domain of
                    pathology; these are morbid manifestations. Then, too, we have the Romantic
                    reason of it all. Käthchen's violent agitation when she sees the Count is
                    explained by the fact of his having previously appeared to her in a dream. At
                    the moment when she sees him in this dream, the Count is in reality lying
                    dangerously ill with typhus fever. Stretched like a corpse on his bed, he
                    himself has the feeling that he is entering Käthchen's room. And when he hears
                    of the strange coincidence, he cannot help exclaiming anxiously--</p>
                <p> "Help me, ye gods! Now am I double! A spirit I, who wander in the night."</p>
                <p>Here we have the favourite idea of Romanticism, "Doppelgängerei," in close
                    connection with somnambulism.</p>
                <p>Somnambulism plays a similar part in _Der Prinz von Homburg_, the finest of
                    Kleist's dramas--probably the finest drama produced by the Romantic School. In
                    it all the important characters stand out as if hewn in stone. The dialogue is
                    vigorous and clear; every word tells. The young cavalry leader commits an
                    unpardonable breach of discipline; he is victorious in an engagement which he
                    has brought about in a manner forbidden in his instructions. The Elector
                    condemns him to death. Not for a moment imagining that the sentence will be
                    carried out, the young hero treats it as a mere matter of form. When it dawns
                    upon him that it is sober earnest, a sudden fear of death takes possession of
                    him, and he abjectly begs for his life. Kleist's genius shows itself in the
                    delineation of the mental process by which the Prince becomes himself again, and
                    demands death as his right. Here once more it is the night side of the mind to
                    which attention is drawn. The Prince is nervous, ill, and absent-minded. In the
                    first act he walks in his sleep. In the last we have the realisation of one of
                    his visions. He transgresses orders, not, like the son of Manlius Torquatus, in
                    youthful audacity and martial ardour, but because, in his nervous, dreamy
                    absent-mindedness he has not heard the orders given, and consequently dashes
                    recklessly on.</p>
                <p>Kleist had been deeply interested by G. H. von Schubert's _Die Nachtseite der
                    Naturwissenschaft_ ("The Night Side of the Science of Nature"). This book,
                    written by the most popular "Naturphilosoph" of the day, is one of the most
                    extravagant works of the whole period. The night side of a planet is that which
                    is turned away from the sun, and only glimmers faintly in the darkness, with a
                    light destitute of warmth, a light in which all objects look strange, and
                    totally different from what they do in the light of the sun. Schubert considers
                    that he succeeds, in his "Science of Nature," in demonstrating the existence of
                    such a night side. The first half of the work is "Naturphilosophie," much as
                    Steffens understood it. "This is certainly not philosophy for the world," says
                    the author, "but it is much older than the world and all its philosophies, and
                    will last much longer." Most of it is on the same lines as the so-called occult
                    sciences of to-day. Man, like the nature which surrounds him, is a "prophetic
                    hieroglyph." In animal magnetism, in somnambulism, in presentiment, and in
                    so-called prescience, proofs are sought of a predestined harmony between the
                    life of the individual and that of the whole.</p>
                <p>According to Schubert's theory, man originally had the power of working miracles.
                    Sin bereft him of his power over nature, and after this there was always
                    something dark and dæmonic connected with the miracle-working gift--with the
                    oracles of Greece, for instance, and with all heathen sorcery. The old, natural
                    miraculous power was revived in Christ. In its dæmonic form it has reappeared
                    among the Rosicrucians and the Freemasons (the secret societies which played so
                    important a part in the imagination of Schubert's day); and it is also
                    observable in such phenomena as animal magnetism, clairvoyance, &amp;c. Adam
                    Müller writes: "Schubert's book seems to me the best which the
                    'Naturphilosophie' has produced; its author, though not superior to Schelling in
                    polemical and critical talent, is certainly his superior in feeling, in
                    sincerity, and above all in erudition.... In Schubert's writings I find a
                    glorified, yet in all essentials accurate presentment of an earlier stage of my
                    development, when my one longing was, that all that was human and personal in my
                    power of achievement might, as it were, dissolve into the smoke of a sweet
                    incense, an offering to the God I worshipped. How I longed to be able to divest
                    myself of name and personality, and become the most devoted of martyrs or the
                    most priestly of priests" (der geistlichste Geistliche). Every one read the
                    book, and even a mind like Kleist's allowed itself, as we have seen, to be
                    engrossed by all this pretentious foolishness. Mysticism was the order of the
                    day, and it is curious to see how the mystic element, the strange trinity of
                    sensuality, religion, and cruelty, insinuates itself into all Kleist's dramas.
                    Take, for example, that remarkable tragedy, _Penthesilea_. The heroine is the
                    wild queen of the Amazons, who is waging a victorious war upon both the Greeks
                    and the Trojans. It is a law among the Amazons that each must capture in battle
                    the man who is to be her husband; then, when the war is over, she lives with him
                    in peace and happiness. Penthesilea has conceived quite as fatal a passion for
                    Achilles as Käthchen's for Count Strahl. But in Penthesilea love shows itself in
                    a different way; it takes the form of cruelty. In every battle she pursues
                    Achilles, thirsting for his blood. If Käthchen loved like a dog, Penthesilea
                    loves like a tigress escaped from a Bacchanalian procession.</p>
                <p>It is plain that it is his own temperament with which Kleist has endowed the
                    Amazon queen. She cares for nothing, will take nothing, but Achilles, just as he
                    refused to aim at anything, to be content with anything, but the highest place
                    of honour. Her wild haste to conquer her beloved corresponds with his desire to
                    attain his aim at one blow, with his drama, _Robert Guiscard_. Like Kleist, she
                    can only live when she is striving after what her soul desires. She says, what
                    her author might have said:[6] "I should go mad if I did not attempt all that is
                    within the bounds of possibility."</p>
                <p>She hates Achilles as fervently as Kleist in dark hours must have hated and
                    cursed the destiny which forbade his winning the highest fame. She kills him in
                    an access of detestation, as Kleist, in an access of desperation, destroyed his
                    beloved work, his _Guiscard_. Yet she loves him, loves him helplessly, with a
                    consuming passion.[6] When Achilles has wounded her in battle, she complains in
                    words which seem to refer to the poet himself:--</p>
                <p> "Mir diesen Busen zu zerschmettern, Prothoe! Die Brust, so voll Gesang, Asteria!
                    Ein Lied, jedweder Saitengriff auf ihn!"[7]</p>
                <p>When she is on the point of giving up everything, she says, as Kleist did in so
                    many of his letters to his sister:--</p>
                <p> "Das Aeusserste, das Menschenkräfte leisten Hab ich gethan, Unmögliches
                    versucht, Mein Alles hab ich an den Wurf gesetzt; Der Würfel, der entscheidet,
                    liegt, er liegt: Begreifen muss ich's--und dass ich verlor!"[8]</p>
                <p>We can readily understand how it was that Pfuel, Kleist's faithful friend, found
                    him sitting weeping after writing the description of Penthesilea's death.
                    Indeed, the poet himself wrote of the play to a friend: "It is true; you have
                    divined it with the glance of a seer; my inmost self is in it, my soul in its
                    glory and its anguish."</p>
                <p>Yet this personal element does not preclude Romantic mysticism; the story is
                    impregnated with it. Penthesilea's love expresses itself in such words as the
                    following:--</p>
                <p> "Hetzt alle Hund' auf ihn! mit Feuerbranden Die Elephanten peitschet auf ihn
                    los! Mit Sichelwagen schmettert auf ihn ein Und mähet seine üpp'gen Glieder
                    ab!"[9]</p>
                <p>This last repulsive wish, to see Achilles' limbs mowed off by the scythes of the
                    chariots, is, as we learn at the conclusion of the play, no feigned desire. The
                    Amazons are defeated, and their wearied and wounded queen falls into Achilles'
                    hands. He loves her, and, to keep her from grieving and despairing, he attempts
                    to make her believe that she has been victorious, and that he is her captive.
                    She soon, however, discovers the truth. Then Achilles challenges her to single
                    combat, with the intention of allowing her to defeat him, and in this manner
                    becoming her husband. When Penthesilea receives the challenge, she does not
                    understand its meaning. She is seized by a sort of Berserker fury, throws
                    herself upon her horse, cries to her hounds, and dashes off. He sees her coming
                    and is afraid. She bends her bow "till the ends kiss," takes aim, and sends an
                    arrow through his neck. He falls, but, with the death rattle in his throat,
                    struggles to rise again; then she urges on her hounds to tear him to pieces,
                    and, following their example, sets her teeth in his breast and bites until the
                    blood drips from her mouth and hands.</p>
                <p> "Doch hetz! schon ruft sie: Tigris! hetz, Leäne! Hetz, Sphinx! Melampus! Dirke!
                    hetz, Hyrkaon! Und stürzt--stürzt mit der ganzen Meut, o Diana! Sich über ihn,
                    und reisst--reisst ihn beim Helmbusch Gleich einer Hündin, Hunden beigesellt,
                    Der greift die Brust ihm, dieser greift den Nacken, Dass von dem Fall der Boden
                    bebt, ihn nieder! Er, in dem Purpur seines Bluts sich wälzend, Rührt ihre sanfte
                    Wange an, und ruft: Penthesilea! meine Braut! was thust du? Ist dies das
                    Rosenfest, das du versprachst? Doch sie--die Löwin hätte ihn gehört, Die
                    hungrige, die wild nach Raub umher Auf öden Schneegefilden heulend treibt-- Sie
                    schlägt, die Rüstung ihm vom Leibe reissend, Den Zahn schlägt sie in seine
                    weisse Brust, Sie und die Hunde, die wetteifernden, Oxus und Sphinx den Zahn in
                    seine rechte, In seine linke sie; als ich erschien, Troff Blut von Mund und
                    Händen ihr herab."[10]</p>
                <p>It is long before she comes to her senses and realises what she has done. Her
                    first feeling is utter despair, but presently she says:--</p>
                <p> "Wie manche, die am Hals des Freundes hängt, Sagt wohl das Wort: sie lieb'ihn, o
                    so sehr, Dass sie vor Liebe gleich ihn fressen könnte; Und hinterher, das Wort
                    geprüft, die Närrin! Gesättigt sein zum Ekel ist sie schon. Nun, du Geliebter,
                    so verfuhr ich nicht; Sieh her: als ich an deinem Halse hing, Hab ich's
                    wahrhaftig Wort für Wort gethan; Ich war nicht so verrückt, als es wohl
                    schien."[11]</p>
                <p>She is not so mad as she seems. It is the same here as in _Käthchen von
                    Heilbronn_--what with most women is only a figure of speech, is in Penthesilea's
                    case reality. Many a woman says she loves her lover with a passion so wild that
                    she could eat him; Penthesilea does it. She says:--</p>
                <p> "Küsse, Bisse, Das reimt sich, und wer recht von Herzen liebt, Kann schon das
                    eine für das andere greifen."[12]</p>
                <p>But even this is not the complete explanation. As yet we have only the two
                    elements, sensuality and cruelty; the third, religion, is present also. It
                    appears as the supplementary colour when we look carefully at the first two.
                    Remember Novalis's words, already quoted: "The divine significance of the
                    sacrament of the Lord's Supper is an enigma to the carnal mind. But he who even
                    once has drunk in the breath of life from warm, beloved lips, whose heart has
                    melted in the quivering flames of holy fire ... he will eat of His body and
                    drink of His blood for ever more." The great Christian mystery was a subject
                    occupying all minds at this time, Kleist's among the rest. One of his intimate
                    friends was the most notable mystic of the day, the ingenious sophist, Adam
                    Müller. It may astonish us, or offend us, to find traces of Christian mystic
                    dogma in a pagan drama which has the Queen of the Amazons for heroine; but to
                    understand this, and many other kindred phenomena, we must take the relative
                    truth and justifiableness of this mysticism into consideration. These men could
                    not shut their religious ideas into a cupboard, and keep them altogether apart
                    from their lives and actions. It was not only twice, or possibly three times, a
                    year that such a subject as the Lord's Supper occupied their minds; it pervaded
                    all their thoughts; they strove to see life in the light of this great mystery.
                    In the complete edition of Friedrich von Baader's collected works (vol. iv.
                    Anthropology), amongst a number of short essays, such as: _On the Ecstatic
                    Rapture of those who Talk in Magnetic Sleep, The Vision Seer of Prevorst, Forty
                    Tenets of Religious Love, &amp;c., &amp;c_., we find one entitled: _That, in the
                    Spiritual, Good or Evil Meaning of the Word, all Men are Anthropophagi_. It
                    begins: "Man at heart, or, to use the language of Scripture, the inner man, does
                    not live on tangible nourishment, on material bread; he lives, and that not in
                    the symbolical, but in the most real meaning of the word, entirely upon other
                    inner men, whose hearts and words are his food."</p>
                <p>The great religious mystery ultimately became the centre round which even
                    philosophical thought revolved. Henrik Steffens may serve as an example. This
                    writer, in whose character, as Julian Schmidt[13] aptly remarks, "there is an
                    undeniable strain of innate servility," was appointed to conduct the trial of
                    the demagogues in Breslau. It was a task which he accomplished in a spirit at
                    variance with sound human reason and the natural sense of justice, and during
                    its performance he gave expression to the most reactionary religious sentiments,
                    entirely forgetful of the pantheism of his youth. In the essay, _How I Once More
                    Became a Lutheran_, he writes: "The Holy Sacrament is the chief individualising
                    process in Christianity; by its means the whole mystery of the redemption enters
                    in all its fulness into the receptive personality. The fertilising stream of
                    grace, which, since the day of the great regeneration, has flowed through all
                    nature and all history, and which matures us for a blessed future, here takes
                    the form of the Saviour, in order that that which is all in all may be
                    completely present.... By means of the satisfying personal presence of the
                    Saviour, that which the Christian truly believes, that which pervades his whole
                    life, and overcomes death, yet at the same time forces him back into the domain
                    of the senses, here becomes certainty, enjoyment, nourishment. ... To me the
                    communion of the Lord's Supper is the highest, most important, most mysterious
                    of all religious acts; so important does it seem to me, that through it every
                    doctrine acquires unfathomable significance."</p>
                <p>We see, then, how tremendously important a part this sacrament plays in the
                    Christian mysticism of the period under consideration. There existed a tender,
                    almost an erotic, relation between the faithful and the consecrated elements.
                    True believers were declared to be sensible of the presence of these elements at
                    an extraordinary distance. Read what Görres writes on the subject in the second
                    part of his _Mystik_. "To begin with what is holiest--" he says, "all who have
                    attained to the higher spiritual life are aware, at a prodigious distance, of
                    the presence of the Host." A number of examples of this are given, and we are
                    told in the preface that all the facts instanced are vouched for by numerous
                    witnesses, that these witnesses were the most reliable imaginable, either
                    priests or pious laymen, and that they were particularly favourably situated for
                    making the necessary observations. And we not only learn that saintly believers
                    can detect the Host, no matter where it may be hidden, but that the Host feels
                    such an attraction towards them, that it springs from the priest's hand into
                    their mouths. Sometimes the priest actually feels that it is violently torn out
                    of his hands, drawn like steel by a magnet; and the saintly, in their turn, are
                    so forcibly attracted to the holy substance that they are carried through the
                    air to it.</p>
                <p>Nowhere in all Kleist's writings has mysticism taken such strange possession of a
                    perfectly pagan, not to say wanton, theme as in his _Amphitryon_, which is an
                    adaptation of Molière's well-known comedy. The story, not a very easy one to
                    treat, is as follows. During Amphitryon's absence, Jupiter assumes his form and
                    visits his wife, Alcmene, who believes the god to be her husband. Amphitryon
                    returns, and a whole series of comical confusions ensue between the real and the
                    pretended husband, the real slave, Sosias, and Mercury as Sosias. At last the
                    true state of affairs is explained, and Amphitryon has to console himself with
                    the consideration that there is nothing dishonourable in such a relationship
                    with Jupiter,--a moral theory which it must have been very much to the interest
                    of Louis the Fourteenth to defend and propagate.</p>
                <p> "Mon nom, qu'incessamment toute la terre adore, étouffe ici le bruit, qui
                    pouvait éclater; Un partage avec Jupiter N'a rien du tout qui déshonore."</p>
                <p>In genuine French fashion, Molière makes the collision between the husband and
                    the lover the main point in his play; and when Alcmene upbraids Jupiter for the
                    hard words he (i.e. Amphitryon) has used to her, the god takes refuge in the
                    following fine distinction:--</p>
                <p> "L'époux, Alcmène, a commis tout le mal; C'est l'époux qu'il vous faut regarder
                    en coupable: L'amant n'a point de part à ce transport brutal, Et de vous
                    offenser son cœur n'est point capable. Il a de vous, ce cœur, pour jamais y
                    penser, Trop de respect et de tendresse; Et si de faire rien à vous pouvoir
                    blesser Il avait eu la coupable faiblesse, De cent coups à vos yeux il voudrait
                    le percer. Mais l'époux est sorti de ce respect soumis Ou pour vous on doit
                    toujours être; A son dur procédé l'époux s'est fait connaître, Et par le droit
                    d'hymen il s'est cru tout permis."</p>
                <p>Jupiter expresses himself, we see, with the polished gallantry of a courtier. At
                    the close of the play the bystanders congratulate the wretched Amphitryon, and
                    Sosias recites an epilogue, in which the whole matter is treated from the
                    comical point of view, and the moral pointed that the less said about such
                    affairs the better.</p>
                <p>Kleist naturally saw the subject in quite a different light. It is obvious that
                    his Romantic mind was attracted first and foremost by the "Doppelgängerei;" then
                    came the possibility of playing, faintly but clearly, on one of the most
                    important mysteries of the Christian faith. Alcmene's husband is not the father
                    of Hercules, yet the conception was no violation of her marriage vow; it was
                    immaculate; the being to which she gives birth is not the child of a man, but of
                    a god. Therefore, in the most important scene between Jupiter and Alcmene, the
                    former is pantheistically exalted to the rank of the great world-spirit; he is
                    not the wanton Olympian of the Greeks, he is as divine and spiritual as the
                    "Absolute" of the _Naturphilosophie_. He says to Alcmene:--</p>
                <p> "Nimmst Du die Welt, sein grosses Werk, wohl wahr? Siehst Du ihn in der
                    Abendröthe Schimmer, Wenn sie durch schweigende Gebüsche fällt? Hörst Du ihn
                    beim Gesaüsel der Gewässer, Und bei dem Schlag der üpp'gen Nachtigall?
                    Verkündigt nicht umsonst der Berg ihn Dir, Gethürmt gen Himmel, nicht umsonst
                    ihn Der felszerstiebten Katarakten Fall? Wenn hoch die Sonn' in seinen Tempel
                    strahlt, Und, von der Freude Pulsschlag eingeläutet, Ihn alle Gättungen
                    Erschaff'ner preisen, Steigst Du nicht in des Herzens Schacht hinab Und betest
                    Deinen Götzen an?"[14]</p>
                <p>Therefore, also, Alcmene is repeatedly addressed as "Thou Holy One!"</p>
                <p> "Du bist, Du Heilige, vor jedem Zutritt Mit diamantnem Gürtel angethan. Auch
                    selbst der Glückliche, den Du empfängst, Entlässt Dich schuldlos noch und
                    rein."...[15]</p>
                <p>Adam Müller wrote an enthusiastic, mystical preface to the play. And in one of
                    his letters to Gentz he writes: "Hartmann has painted a grand picture, 'The
                    Three Marys at the Sepulchre.' This and Amphitryon seem to me to herald a new
                    period in art. For Amphitryon unmistakably treats of the immaculate conception
                    of the Holy Virgin as well as of the mystery of love in general." Even Goethe
                    felt this. He said: "The play contains nothing less than a new, Christian
                    interpretation of the myth as a parallel to the overshadowing of Mary by the
                    Holy Ghost."</p>
                <p>In 1806 Kleist had resigned his appointment and left Königsberg. When the war
                    broke out between France and Prussia, he was, from a misunderstanding,
                    imprisoned for a time by the French. In 1808 he went to Dresden, where he became
                    acquainted with Adam Müller. It was now Müller's ambition, as it had previously
                    been Fr. Schlegel's, to influence men's minds in the capacity of prophet and
                    apostle of Romanticism. He professed ardent admiration for Kleist, and,
                    unfortunately, succeeded in gaining considerable power over him. Müller was a
                    phrasemonger, who had acquired some little knowledge of several sciences, and
                    was at this moment on the point of announcing a new philosophy, in which there
                    was (so he maintained) none of the one-sidedness characteristic of all previous
                    systems. Its distinguishing doctrine was the doctrine of "opposites," of the
                    constantly changing, constantly renewed and superseded "opposite." According to
                    Müller, the spirit of the eighteenth century and the spirit of Romanticism were
                    only disguises of one and the same truth-- a truth of which he no doubt believed
                    himself to have entered into complete and enduring possession when he joined the
                    Church of Rome in 1805.</p>
                <p>For some time after his conversion to Catholicism, Müller's whole intellectual
                    life resolved itself into mysticism. He studied "the mysterious life of the
                    clouds," regarded his nervous fear of thunder and lightning as a special gift
                    bestowed on him by Heaven, and believed himself able to foretell the
                    intellectual development of genius by mathematical calculations. In course of
                    time, in fellowship with Gentz, he entered the field of practical politics,
                    beginning as a Prussian progressive patriot, ending as a reactionary in the
                    service of Metternich.</p>
                <p>In Dresden, in 1808, Müller and Kleist started the periodical, _Phöbus_, in which
                    several of Kleist's best works first saw the light.</p>
                <p>It is characteristic that what pleased Müller most in _Amphitryon_ was exactly
                    that element of Pagan--Christian mysticism, already referred to, which reveals
                    itself in such a speech as the following almost literal reproduction of the
                    words announcing the birth of Christ:--</p>
                <p> "Dir wird ein Sohn geboren, dess Name Hercules."</p>
                <p>He did not penetrate into the spirit of the work. The interest of the play
                    centres in the character of Alcmene, the interest of her character in the vigour
                    with which she refuses to allow her peace of mind to be disturbed and her
                    feelings confused, and the interest of her tragic story in the anguish she
                    suffers when, in spite of herself, her inmost feelings are agitated and
                    perplexed by the appearance of her husband in different forms.</p>
                <p>Goethe, whose genius enabled him, though he did not understand Kleist's
                    character, to understand much of the working of his mind, made the profound
                    remark that what he chiefly aimed at was "confusion of feeling" (Verwirrung des
                    Gefühls). Kleist was in an abnormal degree dependent upon security of feeling.
                    Confusion of feeling was to him the truest tragedy.</p>
                <p>His own strong, undivided feeling was unsettled and perplexed again and again. In
                    conformance with the custom of his family, he became a Prussian officer; but
                    family tradition and his own inclinations were at variance; he could not endure
                    the discipline, and left the army. He fell in love and pledged himself. His
                    feeling for Wilhelmine was strong, but his instinct of self-preservation as an
                    artist was stronger; here, too, there was perplexity of feeling, and he broke
                    off the engagement. He had the feeling that he was a poet, a genius, but the
                    result of all his efforts was a conviction of his want of real capacity, and in
                    dire perplexity he determined to enlist in the French army, hoping to find death
                    in its next campaign. All this explains his perpetual circling round the theme
                    of perplexity of feeling. We have the idea very plainly in the admirable little
                    tale, _Die Marquise von O_. The Marquise knows as little as Alcmene who it is
                    that has embraced her in the dark; her feelings, too, are perplexed and
                    confused; her nearest and dearest suspect her; and when the Russian officer,
                    whom she looks upon as her saviour, but who proves to be the delinquent, returns
                    to her, loving and repentant, her innocent soul is rent by alternate paroxysms
                    of hatred and love. In much the same manner, the sense of justice, originally so
                    strong in the soul of _Michael Kohlhaas_, is confused by the wrongs he
                    suffers.</p>
                <p>Wounded pride led Kleist to quarrel with friends and acquaintances; a wounded
                    sense of justice tempted him to insult Goethe. He sent his _Penthesilea_ to the
                    great master, whom he envied as much as he admired, and was bitterly
                    disappointed when, as might have been expected, it was entirely disapproved of.
                    Goethe, who, unfortunately, was only keen-sighted as regarded the repellent side
                    of Kleist's character, said of him: "In spite of my honest intention to be
                    sympathetic and judge mildly, Kleist aroused in me nothing but shuddering
                    aversion, resembling that produced by a body which nature has made beautiful,
                    but which is attacked by some incurable disease." When the comedy, _Der
                    zerbrochene Krug_ ("The Broken Jar"), failed in Weimar, owing to Goethe's
                    arbitrary rearrangement of its acts, Kleist's feelings became entirely
                    "confused," and he wrote epigrams on the great man's private life, among others
                    the low, ugly one on the child, "the precocious genius," who wrote the
                    epithalamium for his own parents' wedding-day.</p>
                <p>It is this same confusion of feeling which gives their morbidness to all his
                    productions. Even _Michael Kohlhaas_, that masterpiece of the art of
                    story-telling, at the beginning of which each character is drawn with the
                    precision of genius, ends in a kind of dream-like confusion. Towards the close
                    of the story there appear two spectral figures--the sickly and at last
                    half-insane Elector of Saxony, and an extraordinary gipsy woman, who, we are
                    given to understand, is possessed by the spirit of Kohlhaas's dead
                    wife--characters which contrast very forcibly with the simple, sane personages
                    introduced to us at the beginning. _Die heilige Cäcilie_ (St. Cecilia) is a
                    Catholic legend, with a moral pointed against iconoclasm. The author revels here
                    with a certain satisfaction in superstitious ideas; he makes the saint punish
                    the haters and destroyers of the art treasures of the Church with sudden
                    madness.</p>
                <p>Kleist early became addicted to indulgence in opium, a fact of which some of
                    these works remind us.</p>
                <p>In the year 1809 the poet appears as an ardent political agitator. Now, for a
                    time, his voice sounds clear and full. He reproaches his countrymen with not
                    having sufficient confidence in the mysterious power of the heart. He calls
                    Napoleon a sinner, whose iniquity it is beyond the power of human language to
                    express. Such resistance as has been offered to the French seems to him
                    contemptibly weak. He dislikes Fichte's _Addresses to the German Nation_, sneers
                    at Fichte himself as a pedant who talks but cannot act, and expresses unbounded
                    contempt for the members of the _Tugendbund_ and their puerile inactivity. He
                    writes a tragedy, _Die Hermannsschlacht_, with the object of inciting his
                    countrymen to treat Napoleon as Hermann (Arminius) treated Varus. The following
                    lines in it are aimed at the laggard youth of the day:--</p>
                <p> "Die schreiben, Deutschland zu befreien, Mit Chiffren, schicken mit Gefahr des
                    Lebens Einander Boten, die die Römer hängen, Versammeln sich um
                    Zwielicht--essen, trinken, Und schlafen, kommt die Nacht, bei ihren Frauen. * *
                    * * * * * * * Die Hoffnung: morgen stirbt Augustus Lockt sie, bedeckt mit
                    Schmach und Schande, Von einer Woche in die andere."[16]</p>
                <p>So little care does he bestow on the historical colouring of this play that he
                    makes Hermann talk of a "bill" (of exchange), and Varus compare the leader of
                    the Cheruski to a Dervish.</p>
                <p>He wanted such a war as the Spaniards used to wage, with murder and perjury,
                    burning villages and poisoned wells.</p>
                <p>The battle of Wagram shattered all his hopes. Aghast, he asked if there were no
                    such thing as justice upon earth.</p>
                <p>Things stood badly now with Kleist--no comfort in public life, no prospects in
                    private life, no money, no employment, no approbation, no encouragement. His
                    nearest and dearest did not appreciate him. Shortly before his death he writes
                    to a motherly friend: "I would rather die ten times over than endure again what
                    I lately endured in Frankfort, sitting at the dinner-table between my two
                    sisters. The thought that what I have actually done, be it little or much, is
                    not acknowledged by them at all, that I am looked upon as an utterly useless
                    member of society, no longer worthy of the slightest sympathy, not only robs me
                    of the future, but poisons the past to me."</p>
                <p>Unwilling as he was to return to a profession he had given up twelve years
                    before, it at last seemed to him that the only possible way in which he could
                    earn his bread was by re-entering the army. He did not even own money enough to
                    procure an officer's outfit. An appeal to Hardenberg for assistance was left
                    unanswered. It was exactly at this time that Prussia was compelled to enter into
                    an alliance with Napoleon against Russia. Can one imagine greater "confusion of
                    feeling" than was now the lot of the unhappy patriot? The author of the
                    _Hermannsschlacht_, the mortal enemy of Napoleon, forced, as a Prussian officer,
                    to fight for the humiliator of his country!</p>
                <p>This last collision of duties broke his heart. "My soul is so spent," he writes,
                    "that I feel as if the very daylight that shines on me when I put my head out at
                    the window hurts me."</p>
                <p>He was ripe for the irrevocable decision. Through Müller he had made the
                    acquaintance of Frau Henriette Vogel, a gifted woman, who, like himself,
                    suffered from melancholia, and who imagined that she had an incurable disease.
                    This lady reminded him one day, that in an early stage of their friendship he
                    had promised to do anything she might require of him, let it be what it might.
                    He replied that he was ready at any moment to fulfil his promise. "Then kill
                    me," she said. "My sufferings are so great that I can no longer endure life. I
                    don't believe, though, for a moment that you will do it--the men of to-day are
                    not men at all." This was enough for Kleist. In November 1811 he and Henrietta
                    drove together to a little inn on the shore of the Wannsee, a small lake near
                    Potsdam. They were apparently in the best of spirits, full of jest and merriment
                    all that day and until the afternoon of the next, when they went down to a
                    retired spot on the shore, and Kleist shot his friend through the left breast
                    and himself through the head. They had previously written a strange, mournfully
                    humorous letter to Adam Müller's wife. It runs as follows:--</p>
                <p>"Heaven knows, my dear, good friend, what strange feeling, half sorrowful, half
                    glad, moves us to write to you at this hour--when our souls, like two lightsome
                    aërial voyagers, are preparing to take flight from the world. For you must know
                    that we had determined to leave no p.p.c. cards upon our friends and
                    acquaintances. The reason probably is, that we have thought of you a thousand
                    times in as many happy moments, and pictured to ourselves a thousand times how
                    you would have laughed good-naturedly if you had seen us together in the green
                    or the red room. Yes, the world is a strange place! It is not unfitting that we
                    two, Jette and I, two sorrowful, melancholy beings, who have always complained
                    of each other's coldness, should have come to love each other dearly, the best
                    proof of which is, that we are now about to die together.</p>
                <p>"Farewell, our dear, dear friend! May you be happy here upon earth, as it is
                    doubtless possible to be! As for us, we have no desire for the joys of this
                    world; our dream is of the plains of heaven and the heavenly suns, in whose
                    light we shall wander with long wings upon our shoulders. Adieu! A kiss from me,
                    the writer, to Müller. Tell him to think of me sometimes, and to continue to be
                    a brave soldier of God, fighting against the devil of foolishness, who holds the
                    world in his chains."</p>
                <p>Postscript in Henriette's writing:--</p>
                <p> "Doch, wie dies alles zugegangen, Erzähl' ich euch zur ändern Zeit, Dazu bin ich
                    zu eilig heut.[17]</p>
                <p>"Farewell, my dear friends! And do not forget to think, in joy and in sorrow, of
                    the two strange beings who are now about to set out on the great voyage of
                    discovery." HENRIETTE."</p>
                <p>(In Kleist's handwriting)--"Written in the green room, on the 21st of November,
                    1811. H. v. K."</p>
                <p>Kleist was the most intractable character in the intellectual world of the
                    Germany of that day; he had, moreover, too much heart, too strong feelings.
                    After he had given up all hope of attaining to a knowledge of the truth, he
                    tried to build upon the foundation of feeling. As author he was able to do it;
                    his _Michael Kohlhaas_ is based upon the feeling of justice, _Käthchen von
                    Heilbronn_ upon the feeling of absolute devotion. But the real world to which he
                    himself belonged had no use for strong, unmixed feeling such as his. He did not
                    find it in others, and wherever he followed it himself, the consequences were
                    disastrous. Alas! no; nothing was quite certain on this earth, not even his own
                    vocation!</p>
                <p>No one could prize decision, unity of character, more than he did, and never was
                    there a more uncertain, divided, morbid man. He was always despairing, always
                    wavering between the highest endeavour and the inclination to commit suicide.
                    This explains how it is that we see him, the greatest of the Romanticists,
                    liable to almost all the errors which distinguish his contemporaries. His own
                    really fine, noble nature was spoiled very much as are most of the characters in
                    his works, by sinister, disastrous peculiarities, which slacken the will and
                    destroy the elasticity of the mind. Yet Heinrich von Kleist has assured himself
                    a place in literature, like all others who have won places there, by the vigour
                    and the passion with which he lived and wrote.[18]</p>
                <p>In the other notable dramatist of the Romantic School there was far less to
                    disintegrate. He was the genuine Romanticist from the very first.</p>
                <p>Zacharias Werner was born in Königsberg in 1768. He was the son of a professor at
                    the University, who also held the post of dramatic censor. Hence, even as a
                    child, Zacharias had the opportunity of seeing plays almost daily, and in his
                    earliest youth he was able to make himself acquainted with all the
                    technicalities of the stage. His mother, according to Hoffmann, "was richly
                    endowed with both intellect and imagination." Her mind inclined to earnest,
                    highly imaginative mysticism, and she exercised no inconsiderable influence upon
                    her son's ardent imagination; but in course of time she became insane, one of
                    her delusions being that she herself was the Virgin Mary, and her son the
                    Saviour of the world.</p>
                <p>As a student, Zacharias, who was of a sanguine, sensual temperament, led an
                    exceedingly dissolute life. In his twentieth year he published a volume of lyric
                    poems, which, like the earliest writings of Friedrich Schlegel and the other
                    Romanticists, are entirely untouched by mysticism; they inveigh, in the style of
                    the eighteenth century, against "sanctimoniousness, pious stupidity, hypocrisy,
                    and Jesuitism." Nevertheless, while still comparatively young, he himself
                    adopted the sanctimonious style. Though he continued to be dissipated, he cannot
                    exactly be called a hypocrite, for he sinned and repented alternately. The
                    distinguishing feature of his character was instability, as he himself confesses
                    in his last poem, _Unstäts Morgenpsalm_ ("The Unstable Man's Morning Hymn"); and
                    long before, in the prologue to Söhne des Thals ("Sons of the Vale"), he had
                    called himself an inconstant creature, "perpetually erring, lamenting,
                    warning."</p>
                <p>Religious motives induced Werner to join the Freemasons; he believed that this
                    order would prove the means of diffusing throughout the whole world a new and
                    more sincere spirit of piety. Pecuniary motives induced him to accept a
                    Government secretaryship; and in 1795, not long after addressing three
                    enthusiastic poems (a war song, a call to arms, and a lament) to the unfortunate
                    Poles, he took up his abode in the capacity of a Prussian Government official in
                    the conquered city of Warsaw, where he spent ten pleasant years. He married
                    three times during the course of those ten years. The first two marriages were
                    so ill-advised that in both cases the divorce promptly followed the wedding; the
                    third, with a particularly charming Polish lady, lasted for some years. From her
                    he was divorced in 1805. On this occasion Werner took all the blame upon
                    himself. "I am not," he writes to Hitzig at the time, "a bad man, but I am in
                    many ways a weakling, though in others God grants me strength. I am timid,
                    capricious, miserly, uncleanly. You know it yourself." Not a flattering
                    portrait.</p>
                <p>Schleiermacher's _Lectures on Religion_ and, following on these, the writings of
                    Jakob Böhme made no small impression on him. Art and religion now became to him
                    one and the same thing. "Why," he writes to Hitzig, "have we not one name for
                    these two synonyms?" They signify to him what he at one time calls the "vivid
                    sense of the nearness of great Nature," at another, "the simple, humble
                    outpouring of the pure soul into the pure stream (of Nature)." His literary
                    opinions are, he declares, "exactly those of Tieck." In Warsaw he still writes
                    coldly of the Catholic Church; he defends it, not as "a system of faith, but as
                    a newly reopened mine of mythology."</p>
                <p>Death bereft him on one day, the 24th of February, 1804, of his mother and his
                    most intimate friend, Mnioch, a Pole--hence the title of his fatalistic tragedy,
                    _The Twenty-Fourth of February_, written ten years later.</p>
                <p>Having solicited all his patrons and friends in turn to procure him an
                    appointment with as little work and as much remuneration as possible, he finally
                    obtained an easy and profitable post in Berlin, through the influence of a
                    minister who was deeply interested in both religion and freemasonry. He gave
                    himself up for a time to all the amusements and dissipations of the capital;
                    but, after the defeat of the Prussians by Napoleon, he threw up his appointment
                    and began to lead a wandering life. He was alone and free, for all his marriages
                    had been childless, and he had inherited a fortune at his mother's death. He
                    travelled through Germany and Austria, that "blessed land," as he calls it, made
                    the acquaintance of Madame de Staël, and visited her at Coppet. In Weimar he
                    succeeded in obtaining a pension from the Prince-Primate (Fürst-Primas) Dalberg.
                    Professor Passow, who made his acquaintance in Weimar, wrote to Voss: "I dislike
                    Werner exceedingly, for the reason that I have never seen him twice the same.
                    This is the consequence of his insufferable anxiety to please every one. It
                    depends entirely upon his company whether he is the low libertine or the pious
                    devotee of the most modern, most spiritual type." A clergyman named Christian
                    Mayr obtained great influence over him. Mayr was a fanatic and an eccentric. In
                    order to realise one of the visions in the Book of Revelations and to attain
                    heavenly wisdom, he swallowed the greater part of a Bible, and was dangerously
                    ill in consequence; he shot with a pistol at any member of his congregation who
                    fell asleep when he was preaching; and he believed that he could, during the
                    celebration of the sacrament, produce real flesh and blood. This man was
                    desirous that Werner should join a great secret society, the "Kreuzesbrüder im
                    Orient." At first Werner was very enthusiastic in the matter, then he began to
                    entertain doubts, and these doubts partly led to his conversion to
                    Catholicism.</p>
                <p>In November 1809, after paying a visit at Coppet, he went to Rome, where he spent
                    several years. His conversion took place in 1810. During his years of wandering
                    he had led the maddest of lives, dividing each day between low debauchery and
                    religious excitement, between gross sensual indulgence and solemn intercourse
                    with the Deity. The fragments of his diary, published in two small volumes by
                    Schütz, betray a coarse immorality, an obscenity of thought, and a shamelessness
                    of expression, which are rendered only the more repulsive by the outbursts of
                    miserable remorse and self-accusation which interrupt the detailed descriptions
                    of erotic experiences.</p>
                <p>In a testamentary epistle to his friends (dated September 1812) he mentions the
                    two motives which withhold him from a public confession. "The one is, that to
                    open a plague pit is dangerous to the health of the still uninfected bystanders;
                    the other, that, in my writings (for which God forgive me), among a wilderness
                    of poisonous fungi and noxious weeds there is to be found here and there a
                    healing herb, from which the poor sick people to whom it might be useful would
                    assuredly shrink back in horror if they knew the pestilential spot in which it
                    had grown."</p>
                <p>When Werner had (characteristically enough _after_ his conversion) studied
                    theology and made himself acquainted with the Catholic ritual, he was ordained
                    priest. It was in Vienna, in 1814, at the time of the Congress, that he made his
                    first appearance as a preacher. He was most successful. People were impressed by
                    his tall, spare, ascetic figure and his long thin face, with the prominent nose
                    and the dark brown eyes gleaming under heavy eyebrows. He preached to enormous
                    crowds sermons of which the Monk's sermon in _Wallenstein's Lager_ may serve to
                    give a faint idea. They were full of high-flown bombast and disgusting
                    obscenities, united wit and wisdom with ascetic nonsense and tiresome twaddle,
                    overflowed with denunciations of heretics and eulogies of the rosary.[19]</p>
                <p>Werner died in Vienna in 1823. He is the representative-in-chief of mysticism in
                    literature. His life is the key to his works--works which profoundly impressed
                    his contemporaries, but which interest us chiefly from the pathological point of
                    view. He undoubtedly possessed considerable poetic gifts.</p>
                <p>His verse is melodious and falls caressingly on the ear, like the church music of
                    southern lands. His characters are generally well planned (take, for example,
                    Franz von Brienne in the first and second acts of _Die Templer auf Cypern_--"The
                    Knights Templar in Cyprus"), and the action interests and keeps us in suspense;
                    but the core and kernel of it all, the threefold kernel of sensuality, religion,
                    and cruelty, is ill-flavoured and unwholesome.</p>
                <p>His first important work, _Die Söhne des Thals_, which is in two parts, of six
                    acts each, deals with the Order of the Templars. He was obviously inspired to it
                    by the ideas of freemasonry, ideas which had impressed Schubert, had played a
                    part in _Wilhelm Meister_, and had considerably influenced his own private
                    life.</p>
                <p>In this work the encasing of one idea within another--from the very beginning a
                    favourite device of the Romanticists--takes the form of everything circling
                    round a central mystery, the mystery of the secret society; we penetrate ever
                    farther and farther in, but as we do so, it seems to retreat from us. The Order
                    of the Templars has its own particular mysteries, and we witness every detail of
                    the initiation of the neophytes into these--in gloomy vaults, with all the
                    paraphernalia of colossal skeletons, cryptic books, curtains, swords, palms,
                    &amp;c., &amp;c. The meaning underlying it all is: "_Aus Blut und Dunkel quillt
                    Erlösung_" (From blood and darkness issues redemption). But the order of Knights
                    Templar is only a branch order; the great mother-order, "_das Thal_" (the Vale),
                    is in possession, as we learn in the second part of the work, of all the higher
                    mysteries and the higher power. But its inmost mystery, too, is only the purely
                    negative idea of renunciation and sacrifice. Hidden voices proclaim "in a
                    hollow, chanting tone"--</p>
                <p> "Alles ist zum Seyn erkoren, Alles wird durch Tod geboren, Und kein Saatkorn
                    geht verloren. "Wer durch Blut und Nacht geschwommen, Ist den Aengsten bald
                    entnommen, Blutiger, sei uns willkommen!"[20]</p>
                <p>We gain some idea of the extent to which the mysteries are utilised in the
                    elaboration of stage decoration and costumes from the fact that in the twelfth
                    scene of the fifth act, which consists of sixty-four lines, only six are
                    dialogue, the remainder being devoted to directions regarding "a great burial
                    mound, covered with roses, with transparencies of an angel, a lion, a bull, and
                    an eagle, disposed at the four corners"--the costumes to be worn by the
                    dignitaries of the "Vale," of which some are to be cloth of gold, some silver,
                    some sky blue, some blood red--and the incense, the harps, the bells, the crowns
                    and crowns of thorns, the banners, and the "colossal statue of Isis," required
                    in the scene.</p>
                <p>The Order of Knights Templar has degenerated. The mother-order determines to
                    abolish it altogether, and condemns its Grand Master, the noble and heroic
                    Molay, to be burned, although he is entirely guiltless of the decadence of his
                    order--has, in fact, striven hard to arrest it. The Archbishop, who tries him,
                    is convinced of the injustice of the accusations brought against him, and loves
                    and admires him, but is compelled to obey orders. Molay faces death with as
                    great calm as Paludan-Müller's Kalanus; in fact, he longs for the "purifying
                    flames." The bystanders sympathise with him, and cry to him to make his escape;
                    but, like Kalanus, he resists all entreaties. The Archbishop's feeling for him
                    is shared by every one; he is surrounded by a crowd of sentimental executioners,
                    who consign him to the flames with expressions of the utmost admiration and
                    esteem. They are cruel, sentimental fanatics, like Werner himself. Every
                    character in the play is tainted with repulsive sentimentality. Molay's old
                    comrade in arms, when prevented from rescuing him, says:--</p>
                <p> "Du böser Jakob Du!--Pfui! sterben will er, Verlassen seinen
                    Waffenbruder!--Jakob! Du musst nicht sterben! hörst Du?"[21]</p>
                <p>But the guiltless Molay dies. There is the same play upon the Christian mystery
                    here as in Kleist's drama. Molay is venerated like a second Christ, even by his
                    executioners. After his death a miracle happens. "Sunlight gilds the scene.
                    Above the entrance to the Vale cavern, below the brightly illuminated name
                    'Jesus' there appear the names 'John,' 'J. B. Molay,' and 'Andrew,' also in
                    bright transparencies." All the crusaders fall upon their knees. "Long, solemn
                    pause, during which there come from the interior of the cavern the muffled
                    sounds of the 'Holy! Holy! Holy!' sung by the elders of the Order of the Vale to
                    the usual tune, with an accompaniment of harps and bells."</p>
                <p>Martyrdom is Werner's specialty. He is at home in such subjects as beating to
                    death with clubs, boiling in oil, and the tortures of the rack. He revels in
                    agonies, as does Görres, whose satisfaction we almost seem to feel as we read of
                    all the mysteries of martyrdom in the first part of his _Christian Mysticism_.
                    "The sacrificial victims are stretched upon the rack or the wheel, and all their
                    limbs are twisted out of joint by means of screws ... while the lictors scorch
                    their sides with torches or tear them with iron claws. Chains are sometimes
                    drawn round their bodies until their ribs are broken; their chests and eyes are
                    pierced with pointed reeds; their jaws are broken with heavy blows of the
                    torturer's fist; and, though the victims are now hardly drawing breath, nails
                    are hammered through their feet and red-hot iron rods are laid upon their
                    tenderest parts and allowed to burn themselves in," &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In Werner's drama, _Attila_, a young man whom Attila loves is accused of perjury
                    and confesses his guilt. Attila, who is an emotional, sentimental enthusiast,
                    embraces him, shedding burning tears, and then orders him to be torn asunder by
                    horses. Cruel sentimentality, fanatic brutality, is Romantic wont. Along with
                    Attila we have Pope Leo, another character who seems to have escaped from the
                    pages of Görres' _Mysticism_--this time undoubtedly from the chapter treating of
                    the height from the ground to which the enthusiast in his religious rapture is
                    at times raised; for, while he is praying, Leo "raises himself higher and
                    higher, until he is resting only on the tips of his toes." He sympathises with
                    Attila, and has a sort of magnetic influence over him.</p>
                <p>In _Martin Luther, oder die Weihe der Kraft_ ("The Consecration of Strength"),
                    the mystery of religious consecration is the subject. The play opens
                    significantly with a scene of the Novalis type, miners going down into and being
                    drawn up from a mine. The representation of Luther is more suggestive of a
                    Catholic saint than of the Protestant reformer. Of Katharina von Bora, too, a
                    saintly character is made. Luther and she are accompanied throughout the play by
                    guardian angels, Luther by the boy Theobald, who is really art in the shape of a
                    seraph, and Katharina by a girl named Therese, who represents faith. A few years
                    after Werner had thus sung the praises of the Reformation, he was converted;
                    whereupon he wrote a poem, _Die Weihe der Unkraft_, full of such sentiments
                    regarding his drama as: "Durch dies Gaukelblendwerk sprach ich der Wahrheit
                    Hohn!" (With this delusive mummery I set at nought the truth.)</p>
                <p>The subject of his last tragedy, _Die Mutter der Makkabäer_, offered glorious
                    opportunities for introducing all the tortures described in the legends of the
                    martyrs; it abounds in physical suffering and religious ecstasies. The sons of
                    Salome must either eat of the flesh of the sacrifice offered to Jupiter or die
                    the most cruel death. The comical idea of its being a matter of life and death
                    whether children taste certain food or not, is treated with the most
                    overwhelming solemnity. In a state of supernatural excitement, Salome entreats
                    her children, one by one, to allow themselves to be impaled, flayed, burned,
                    &amp;c. The sentimental chief torturer, Antiochus, admires Salome intensely; he
                    actually falls upon his knees before her, crying--</p>
                <p> "Du bist kein irdisch Weib!--Solch Opfer spendet Kein menschlich Wesen!--Segne
                    mich, Du, vom Olymp gesendet!"[22]</p>
                <p>And the equally sentimental Salome blesses him. Her son Benoni, too, blesses his
                    murderer, immediately after which his hands and feet are cut off, and he is
                    boiled in oil. Presently two loud axe-strokes are heard--Abir's feet have been
                    cut off. Juda is tortured next; and so on it goes. Antiochus, the barbarous
                    king, or Werner, the equally barbarous poet, has the children broken on the
                    wheel joint by joint, and their limbs torn off. The mother, who is compelled to
                    witness it all, feels nothing but the rapturous bliss of martyrdom; and when
                    Antiochus, in his insane sentimentality, bows before her a second time, "deeply
                    moved," crying: "Willst, grosse Niobe, Du Dich von mir im Zorne trennen?" ("And
                    must thou part from me in wrath, great Niobe?"), she lays her right hand on his
                    head, and says "very solemnly": "Ich weiss, dass mein Erlöser lebt!--Lern'
                    sterbend ihn erkennen!" ("I know that my Redeemer liveth!--Ere death come, mayst
                    thou know him too!").</p>
                <p>In the last scene the background opens, and we see the instruments of torture and
                    the huge copper full of boiling oil, in which Benoni lies. His wife is staring
                    down into it. The flames of the stake are still blazing. Salome's spirit appears
                    above them and extinguishes them.</p>
                <p>And there was a time when this was considered poetry! Goethe took a warm interest
                    in Werner, and had several of his plays performed in the court theatre at
                    Weimar. In 1808 he wrote of him to Jacobi: "It seems strange to an old pagan
                    like me, that I can see the cross planted on my own territory, and hear Christ's
                    blood and wounds preached poetically, without its being actually offensive to
                    me. The standpoint to which philosophy has raised us makes this degree of
                    tolerance obligatory. We have learned to value the ideal, even when it manifests
                    itself in the strangest forms."</p>
                <p>Few educated men will be inclined to take so mild and tolerant a view of the
                    matter to-day. The development is utterly repugnant to us. For we have seen to
                    what it led. We have seen that this "Christian poetry" helped to bring about the
                    worst intellectual reaction of modern times. Men played so long with the idea of
                    the purifying flames of the stake that they began to extol them in sober
                    earnest. It is but a step from Werner to Görres, who ardently defends exorcism
                    of evil spirits and punishment of witchcraft; and the distance is no greater
                    between Görres and Joseph de Maistre, who writes: "In many a well-governed
                    country in Europe they say of a man who has set fire to an inhabited house and
                    been burned with it: 'It is only what he deserved.' Is a human being who has
                    been guilty of any amount of theoretical and practical (i.e. religious)
                    evil-doing less deserving of being burned? When one reflects that it was
                    undoubtedly in the power of the Inquisition to have prevented the French
                    Revolution, one cannot feel certain that the sovereign who calmly discarded such
                    a weapon did not deal a fatal blow to humanity."</p>
                <p>If Romantic Christianity is, as Ruge says, the Christianity which cannot be
                    resolved into humanitarianism, then Joseph de Maistre is a genuine
                    Romanticist.</p>
                <p>The whole history of Romanticism substantiates Ruge's famous definition: "A
                    Romanticist is an author who, aided by all the intellectual advantages of our
                    day, assails the periods of 'enlightenment' and of revolution, and reprobates
                    and combats the principle of pure humanitarianism in the domains of science,
                    art, morality, and politics."</p>
                <p>[1] "It is not, then, so much religion that influences me, as strong affection
                    for the olden times, and grief that we of to-day are so unlike those heroes of
                    the faith."</p>
                <p>[2] "What I had taken to be ravine and mountain, wood, meadow, and cliff, was one
                    great head, the forest its hair and beard. The giant smiles to see his children
                    happy at their play. He beckons, and straightway through the forest is heard a
                    rustle of holy awe. I fell upon my knees, trembling with fear. I whispered to
                    the little child: 'What is that great being yonder?' The child replied: 'The
                    fear of him comes upon thee because thou hast been permitted to see him without
                    warning; that is our father, our preserver; his name is Pan.'"</p>

                    Melampus, Dirke, and Hyrkaon!' and, shouting thus, she rushes madly at him with
                    the pack, and, like a dog among the dogs, catches him by the plume of his helmet
                    and pulls him down, the earth shuddering at his fall. One has him by the neck,
                    one by the breast. Weltering in his blood, he touches her soft cheek and cries:
                    'Penthesilea! sweet love! art thou beside thyself? Is this the bridal festival
                    thou promisedst?' The lioness, the hungry lioness roaring for her prey on the
                    barren plain, would have listened to him--but she--she tears the breastplate
                    from his breast, and sets her teeth deep in his flesh--she and her hounds in
                    rivalry; Oxus and Sphinx have him by the right breast, she by the left. When I
                    arrived, the blood was streaming from her mouth and hands."</p>

                    was not so with me, beloved. When I hung upon thy neck I said it not; I did it.
                    I was not so mad as I seemed to thee to be."</p>

                <p>ROMANTIC LITERATURE AND POLITICS</p>
                <p>In its first period, Romanticism is distinctly non-political. It exalts the
                    established order of things (_vide_ Novalis), it submissively acknowledges the
                    authority of the king and of the Church, but in its purely literary productions
                    it is, generally speaking, politically colourless.</p>
                <p>Take Tieck's satiric comedies. In their outward form there is something
                    Aristophanic; but their satire is never directed against any political character
                    or tendency. It is aimed at "enlightenment;" and from Tieck's biographer we
                    learn exactly what the poet understood by this word. At that time, says Köpke,
                    the most prominent and respected men in Berlin, those who were still the leaders
                    of public opinion, were of the school of Frederick the Great. The prevailing
                    opinions of the eighteenth century had become their second nature. They were
                    moral, conscientious men, who, in all the different departments of
                    administration, science, and literature, devoted themselves zealously, and often
                    with extraordinary industry, to their duties. Whether government officials,
                    theologians, teachers, critics, popular philosophers, or poets, they all aimed
                    at making religion and science useful, and at educating mankind by external
                    provisions and rules. Intelligibility and popularity being to them
                    all-important, they naturally diluted and levelled everything to one general
                    plane of mediocrity. A certain blameless philistinism became their moral ideal,
                    an ideal which seemed poor and tame in comparison with the old fervour of faith.
                    Lessing was their prophet, and they believed themselves to be perpetuating his
                    tradition. We can readily understand that they fell foul of Goethe, which indeed
                    Lessing himself had done, and that they had a narrow conception of the
                    significance and value of imagination. To them it was only the handmaid of
                    utility, and of no value except as an instrument in the service of morality.</p>
                <p>Everywhere throughout Tieck's writings we come upon mockery of this moral
                    literary tendency. Take, for instance, _Der Gestiefelte Kater_ ("Puss in
                    Boots").--Hinze, the cat, is taking an evening walk, absorbed in melancholy
                    thought. He begins to sing a hunting song. A nightingale strikes up in a bush
                    close at hand. "She sings magnificently, this songstress of the groves," says
                    Hinze; "but think how delicious she must _taste_! Happy indeed are the great of
                    the earth; they can eat as many nightingales and larks as they fancy. We poor
                    common people have to be content with the song, with the beauty, with the
                    indescribably sweet harmony.--It is terrible that I cannot hear anything sing
                    without wanting to eat it."</p>
                <p>Hisses from the pit. The worthy audience is shocked by the cat's ignoble train of
                    thought. So Hinze lets the nightingale alone; but presently, when a rabbit comes
                    bounding by, he catches him adroitly and puts him into his bag. It is his
                    intention, by the gift of this rabbit, to win the king's heart for his master.
                    "The creature," he reflects aloud, "is a sort of cousin of mine; but it's the
                    way of the world nowadays--kinsman against kinsman, brother against brother!" He
                    is presently strongly tempted to eat the rabbit himself, but overcomes the
                    desire, and cries: "Fie! for shame, Hinze! Is it not the duty of the truly noble
                    to sacrifice themselves and their inclinations to the happiness of their
                    fellow-creatures? It is the end for which we were created, and he who cannot do
                    it--oh! it were better for him that he had never been born!" He is about to
                    retire, but loud applause and cries of _Da Capo_! oblige him to repeat the last
                    speech, after which he bows, and goes off with the rabbit. The audience is in
                    the seventh heaven of delight--Hinze's speech is as effective as one of
                    Iffland's tirades.</p>
                <p>The satire in Tieck's _Däumling_ ("Hop o' my Thumb") is also of a literary
                    nature, being directed against the neo-classic tendency, and in particular
                    against Goethe. Such a theme, treated, as it was in part, in the dignified metre
                    of Greek tragedy, afforded many opportunities for drollery. All the incidents of
                    the medieval fairy-tale are viewed from the antique standpoint. Of the
                    seven-league boots, for instance, we read: "Trust me; I see quite well that
                    these boots have come down to us from old Greek times. No man in our day
                    produces work like that--so strong, so simple, such noble lines, such stitching!
                    No, no! this is the work of Phidias, there is no doubt about it. Look! When I
                    place the one in this position--how noble, how plastic, how grand in its
                    simplicity! No superfluity, no ornament, no Gothic detail, none of the romantic
                    medley of our days--when sole, leather, flaps, folds, blacking, varnish, must
                    all contribute to produce variety, brilliancy, a dazzling resplendence in which
                    there is nothing ideal. Nowadays the leather must shine, the sole must creak
                    when one sets one's foot down: wretched rhyming trickery of which the ancients
                    knew nothing." Several of Goethe's favourite words are employed in this more
                    sarcastic than witty description.</p>
                <p>Tieck shows most wit in defending himself against the accusation of exaggerated
                    sentimentality. His satire might quite well apply to the modern admirers of
                    Prosper Mérimée. He revenges himself upon his critics by placing their
                    objections in the mouth of Leidgast, the cannibal, who comes home, smells human
                    flesh, and determines to eat Hop o' my Thumb and his brothers and sisters for
                    breakfast next morning. In the meantime they are to be kept in the garret. "But
                    what if your own three little ones should awake?" objects his wife. "Well, what
                    then?" "The strange children would not be safe. Yours are so eager for human
                    flesh that they have lately actually tried to suck my blood." "You don't say so?
                    I should never have credited them with so much sense and understanding." His
                    wife weeps. "Be done with this sentimentality, wife. I cannot bear an effeminate
                    education. I have strictly forbidden them all these prejudices, superstitions,
                    and enthusiasms. Untutored, unadulterated nature! that's the thing for me."</p>
                <p>However varied the objects of Tieck's satire may be, it is always literary
                    satire; it never crosses the boundary between literature and life. Iffland and
                    Kotzebue, the bombastic classic style and narrow-minded philistine criticism,
                    the text of _The Magic Flute_, Nicolai's travellers' tales, academic pedantry
                    and the _Litteraturzeitung_--these are the unfailing scapegoats.</p>
                <p>Occasionally, in striking at "enlightenment" and everything thereto pertaining,
                    he has a half accidental thrust at the powers that be. The king in _Puss in
                    Boots_, for instance, who places the court scientist on the same level with the
                    court fool, who lives for military parades, loves to listen to repetitions of
                    the figures arrived at in astronomical calculations, and bestows his favour in
                    return for a tasty rabbit, certainly does not represent royalty in the most
                    advantageous light. But this happened half accidentally. In the same play the
                    law goes by the name of Popanz (the bogey-man), is changed into a mouse, creeps
                    into a mouse-hole, and is eaten by Hinze, who, not long after, shouts: 'Long
                    live the Tiers Etat!' But this is no more nor less than a specimen of real
                    Romantic nonsense, with no meaning in it at all. The only trace of real
                    political satire to be found, is in one of Tieck's early works, _Hanswurst als
                    Emigrant_, Hanswurst being no other than the Prince d'Artois, who, in his
                    character of poor, stupid emigrant, has to ride on his servant's back for want
                    of a horse. But this work remained unpublished during Tieck's lifetime.</p>
                <p>It does not surprise us that Kotzebue failed in his attempts to get Tieck into
                    disgrace for writing political satire. Having succeeded, in 1802, in gaining
                    admission to the court, he, Kotzebue, endeavoured to revenge himself on his
                    adversary by reading the parade scene from _Zerbino_ to the king, interspersing
                    malicious hints. It was an ineffectual endeavour, for the king took no notice.
                    And Tieck was pleased and proud to be able to prove his innocence--the play had
                    been written in 1790, under totally different conditions, and was founded
                    entirely upon youthful impressions. His satisfaction was so far justifiable; for
                    abusive personal satire is out of place in art. Nevertheless, the anecdote
                    affects us tragi-comically. The poetry was harmless enough, heaven knows. There
                    was no cause for any king or government in the world to be in the least
                    disturbed by such satire. Unluckily, the best satirical poetry is not of the
                    kind that leaves every one unscathed. The comedies of Aristophanes, with which
                    Tieck's admirers thought his worthy of comparison, were considerably less
                    innocent and innocuous; and all the really great satirical works of later days,
                    such as Molière's _Tartuffe_ or Beaumarchais' _Figaro_, have one characteristic
                    in common--their action does not take place in the moon; they make war on
                    something besides inept poets and moralising poetry.</p>
                <p>Romanticism, however, did not long maintain this aloofness from life and
                    politics.</p>
                <p>The year 1806 was a critical year for Prussia and Germany.[1] The country was
                    entirely in the power of the foreign conqueror. But this is the very reason why
                    all the great reforms trace their origin to this year. The depth of adversity
                    reached was so great that an energetic upward struggle had become imperative.
                    The indefatigable Baron von Stein began the reorganisation of Prussian public
                    institutions; Scharnhorst remodelled the army; the state of the universities was
                    inquired into; and as one result of this last proceeding Fichte was called to
                    Berlin in 1807. The appointment was a remarkable one in many respects. It was
                    intended to show that henceforth a new and different spirit was to rule. When,
                    in 1792, Fichte wrote his first work, _Versuch einer Kritik aller Offenbarung_
                    ("An Attempt at a Criticism of all Revelation"), he was afraid to publish it
                    otherwise than anonymously. When, somewhat later, he brought out his
                    _Zurückforderung der Denkfreiheit_ ("Demand for the Restoration of Freedom of
                    Thought"), he dared not even name the town in which the book was printed. It was
                    published in "Heliopolis"--also anonymously. From his post of professor at Jena
                    he was dismissed on a charge of atheism. But now that the day of need had come,
                    he was suddenly appealed to, to rouse the youth of Germany. As every one is
                    aware, his _Reden an die Deutsche Nation_ ("Addresses to the German Nation")
                    surpassed all expectation. It had been no bad idea, this thrusting of the German
                    flag into the hand of the persecuted philosopher. At the University of Berlin,
                    with French bayonets gleaming outside the windows and French drums drowning his
                    words, he delivered the memorable addresses which sounded the _réveille_ in the
                    ears of Germany, and did their part in driving those drums and bayonets out of
                    the country. For from these lectures a general and powerful revulsion of feeling
                    may be dated. In them Fichte's philosophy became a kind of national poetry. And
                    what wonder that this poetry proved a torch, at which many other poetical
                    torches were kindled--Körner's, Schenkendorf's, and Arndt's among the rest?</p>
                <p>The long-prepared-for war broke out in 1813, and ended, after various
                    vicissitudes, in the downfall of foreign rule. But the War of Liberation, as it
                    was called, has two aspects. It was a revolt against a monstrous tyranny, but a
                    tyranny which represented many of the ideas of the Revolution. It was a war for
                    hearth and home, but waged at the command of the old dynasties. The
                    revolutionary tyranny was opposed in the interest of reactionary princes.
                    Moreover, even in the ardour with which the struggle was maintained, there were
                    two very different elements, which were so closely commingled that in the
                    beginning it occurred to no one to distinguish between them, but which soon
                    betrayed their opposite characters. The one element was national hatred of the
                    French people--the national prejudice which seems to be inseparably connected
                    with patriotism, and which led in this case to enthusiasm for everything German
                    and contempt for everything French. The other element was pure love of
                    freedom--the determination to attain political independence, to fight, not only
                    in the name of Germany, but in the name of humanity, for human rights and
                    privileges.</p>
                <p>This dual feeling may be traced even in Fichte's addresses. He affirmed that only
                    a people that had been a people from of old, a people that understood the depths
                    of its own spirit, its own language, i.e. itself, could be free, and the
                    liberators of the world; "_and_" he added, "_the Germans are such a people_."
                    Teutonic national arrogance lay dormant in these words. And the seed soon began
                    to grow. The young, healthy love of freedom found expression in Theodor Körner's
                    bold lyrics. It was Schiller's lyre that he touched, but the genius of a new era
                    had tuned its strings in a new key. The patriotism of a whole group of other
                    poets took the form of enthusiasm for the German Empire and a German Emperor,
                    that is to say, for the Germany of the Middle Ages; and these made the glories
                    of the past their theme. Max von Schenkendorf sang mournfully and longingly of
                    the days when--</p>
                <p> "Die hohen adligen Gestalten Am Rheinstrom auf und nieder wallten,"[2]</p>
                <p>and when predatory nobles ruled town and country from their fortified castles. He
                    wrote odes to the old cathedrals, groped with tremulous awe among the skeletons
                    of saints and knights buried in their chapels.</p>
                <p>One of the most famous of the patriotic poets was Ernst Moritz Arndt. With Arndt
                    hatred of everything French became a fixed idea. His _Geist der Zeit_ ("Spirit
                    of the Times"), the first part of which appeared in 1806, had a very powerful
                    influence on the minds of his countrymen. And while he was writing his manly,
                    vigorous songs in praise of freedom, he was also occupied in attacking the
                    French language and French fashions; he even went the length of attempting to
                    introduce a German national dress. At this same moment, Jahn, the famous
                    introducer of gymnastics, the "Turnvater," as he is called, was earnestly
                    engrossed with the idea of making the whole youth of Germany fit for war by
                    means of physical exercises. In 1811, at Hasenhaide, near Berlin, he started his
                    school of gymnastics; but previous to this, following Arndt's example, he had
                    published writings, in which, in affectedly violent language, he tried to
                    inflame the spirit of patriotism. The old German mythology and heroic sagas,
                    Hermann and the Teutoburgerwald, Wodan and the Druids, the sacred oaks, the
                    divine primitive German warrior in his boldness and uncouthness, his unkempt
                    hair flowing over his shoulders and a club grasped in his gigantic fists, were
                    anew elevated to the place of honour. German uncouthness was supposed to testify
                    to German morality.</p>
                <p>It was not long till all these patriotic ideas and enterprises were pressed into
                    the service of reaction. The object of worship became, not the freedom that was
                    to be won, but Germany's vanished past. Men began to study the history of their
                    country with an ardour with which it had never been studied before, and a keen
                    eye for all peculiarly German traits. With the brothers Grimm at their head,
                    they turned their attention to the history and grammar of their own language,
                    and in this domain, as in every other, fell foolishly in love with the past and
                    its childish naïveté. Important as the results of these investigations have been
                    to science, it is certain that in Germany they produced some of the worst
                    enemies of liberty, men who sided with the past against the present.</p>
                <p>The patriotic and the religious party soon made common cause. French immorality
                    had been confronted with a peculiarly German morality; now French free-thought
                    was confronted with a peculiarly German Christianity. Because the religion of
                    Germany's enemies paid homage to the human mind, with its lucidity and freedom,
                    the religion of Germany was to be ecclesiastical Christianity, with its
                    obscurity and tyranny. Believing that they were becoming more religious, they in
                    reality became less so. For it is an indisputable truth, one that holds good in
                    all ages and all countries, that, true religion being enthusiasm for the living
                    spirit and idea of the times, as yet unrealised by the many, he who is filled
                    with that living spirit will seem irreligious, but really be religious, whilst
                    he who is filled with the spirit or faith of a bygone, a defunct age, will be
                    most irreligious, but seem and be called religious.</p>
                <p>The immature intellects of the War of Liberation were caught in the snares of
                    Romanticism. It is significant that men who, like Arndt and Görres, were
                    regarded as the champions of liberty, soon began to express most anti-liberal
                    opinions. Arndt made a bitter attack upon what he called industrialism, i.e.,
                    modern industrial conditions, as opposed to the old guild system, and was loud
                    in his condemnation of machinery and steam, which robbed human feet of their
                    right (to walk), the labourer of his work, and mountain and valley of their
                    meaning. He was anxious that any future additions to the ranks of the
                    aristocracy should be prevented by the inscription of all noble names in a final
                    roll, a "golden book;" and he advocated entail and primogeniture as the one sure
                    defence against the general break-up of society by an inundation of the
                    proletariat. Görres, who for a time retained some remembrance of the days when
                    he edited _Das rothe Blatt_, ultimately became the author of _Christian
                    Mysticism_, and such a fierce reactionary that he attacked the pietistic policy
                    of Prussia as not sufficiently thorough-going, and brought on himself a reproof
                    from Leo XII.</p>
                <p>The Christian-Germanic reaction which was one of the results of the War of
                    Liberation found very characteristic literary expression in a series of tales by
                    a nobleman who had fought in the war as a cavalry officer, Baron de la Motte
                    Fouqué. Fouqué is principally known to the reading world at large by his
                    charming little story, _Undine_. As a specimen of Romantic "Naturpoesie" at its
                    best, this tale is only inferior to Tieck's _Elfenmärchen_ ("The Elves"). But
                    Undine is the one really living figure which Fouqué has produced. The cause of
                    his success in this case probably lay in the fact that he was depicting a being
                    who was only half human, half an element of nature--a wave, spray, the cool
                    freshness and wild movement of water--a being without a soul. Until Undine has
                    given herself to the Knight, she stands in some magic relationship to the
                    restless, soulless sea; it is she who flings its spray against the window, and
                    makes it rise until the peninsula is changed into an island, and the Knight is a
                    captive in the fisherman's hut. Fouqué, who was a poet without being a
                    psychologist, found a subject exactly suited to his imaginative talent in this
                    being, which corresponded to one of the elements, and hence itself consisted of
                    but one life-element. (It was in Undine's image that Hans Christian Andersen
                    created "The Little Mermaid.") The bridal night brings a soul to Undine, and she
                    is changed into the model German wife, obedient, tender, and sentimental. Her
                    husband's harshness kills her. In her magnanimity she has caused the castle well
                    to be covered with an enormous stone, in order to block up the only way by which
                    her uncle, the water-spirit, Kühleborn, can enter the castle and avenge her.
                    When, despite every warning, the Knight is faithless and marries again, and his
                    arrogant bride has the stone removed from the well, inexorable fate compels
                    Undine to rise out of its depths and bring him death in a kiss. Although the
                    theme is genuinely medieval (borrowed, in fact, from Paracelsus, whose theory of
                    the elemental spirits is founded upon old popular beliefs), and although in the
                    course of its elaboration the author often relapses into sentimental piety, yet,
                    to its decided advantage, a fresh pagan note is predominant in the story.
                    Undine's originality lies in her pagan nature, as it reveals itself before she
                    is baptized; and there is something genuinely Greek in the idea of its not being
                    the skeleton with the scythe which comes for the dying man, but an elemental
                    spirit which brings him death in a loving kiss.</p>
                <p>But at the same time that Fouqué was embodying such originality and genius as he
                    possessed in this little tale, he was also, under the influence of the great
                    national movement, projecting the long series of romances of chivalry which
                    began with _Der Zauberring_ ("The Magic Ring"), published in 1815. To the
                    romantic reactionaries _The Magic Ring_ became a sort of gospel. Nobles and
                    squires saw themselves reflected in all these old burnished shields and coats of
                    mail, and rejoiced at the sight. But it was not a faithful historical picture
                    which Fouqué exhibited. His age of chivalry is an imaginary age, in which
                    stately, high-born men, clad in armour of burnished silver or of some dull metal
                    inlaid with gold, and wearing silver helmets, plumed or unplumed, or iron
                    helmets surmounted by golden eagles' wings, the visors sometimes raised,
                    sometimes lowered, ride forth upon fiery chargers of all breeds and all colours,
                    shiver each other's lances, and yet sit as if moulded in the saddle, or else
                    fall to the earth only to rise as quick as lightning and draw a two-edged sword.
                    The knights are proud and brave, the faithful squires give their lives for their
                    masters, the slender demoiselles award the prizes at the tourneys, and love
                    their knights "_minniglich_." Everything is ordered according to the exact
                    prescriptions of the book of the laws of chivalry.</p>
                <p>Everything is conventional--first and foremost, the mawkish, languishing style,
                    supposed to be peculiarly adapted to the glorification of this high-born
                    society. Only examples can give any idea of it. Bertha, sitting by a rivulet,
                    sees her reflection in the water. "Bertha blushed so brightly that it seemed as
                    if a star had been kindled in the water." "They sang a morning song so sweet and
                    pleasurable that it seemed as though the setting sun must rise again, drawn by
                    the yearning harmonies." There is a plentiful use of embellishing adjectives:
                    "The youth's heart burned with _charming_ (_anmutig_) curiosity." "Two
                    crystal-clear drops fell from the eyes of the old knight." Great importance is
                    attached to the description of splendid clothes and armour and ornaments: "He
                    was beautiful to look upon in his armour of the darkest blue steel,
                    magnificently chased and ornamented with gold; beautiful were his dark brown
                    hair, his trim moustache, and the fresh young mouth smiling below it, disclosing
                    two rows of pearly white teeth." A noble lady, pouring forth the tale of her
                    misfortunes, takes time to interlard it with descriptions like the following: "I
                    paced distractedly up and down my room, would hear nothing of the games in which
                    the other noble maidens invited me to take part in the evening, and impatiently
                    waved my maid away when she brought me a beautiful fishing-rod, _inlaid with
                    mother-of-pearl_, with a _golden_ line and _silver_ hook." It is strange that
                    the inhabitants of a world where all utensils seem to be made of
                    mother-of-pearl, gold, and silver, should think it necessary specially to
                    mention that the gift offered her was composed of these peerless materials.</p>
                <p>The emotions are of the same material, all mother-of-pearl and cloth of gold--not
                    one breath of unrestrained natural feeling, not one action dictated by pure,
                    unreflecting passion. All the emotions and passions are as carefully trained as
                    the knights' chargers. We know beforehand how everything will happen. The
                    knights talk to and treat each other with that distinguished courtesy which is
                    peculiar to the privileged classes. One of them inadvertently lets fall a word
                    (about a lady or a joust) which makes it necessary for another to challenge him
                    to mortal combat. Without showing a trace of petty rancour or ill-feeling, the
                    two combatants arm and leap on their snorting chargers; their attendants form a
                    circle round them, holding torches if it is night, and they thrust and hew at
                    each other with all their might. When the one sinks bleeding to the earth, the
                    other throws himself down beside him and binds his wounds with brotherly
                    tenderness and practised surgical skill; then he gives him his arm, and they
                    march off together, their armour clanking bravely.--It is an attempt to resolve
                    the whole rich life of the human soul into a few conventional elements--honour,
                    loyalty, devout and humble love.</p>
                <p>In combination with these fine feelings we have the greatest contempt for all
                    except the privileged classes. The hero, Sir Otto, is at a masquerade at the
                    house of his friend, the young merchant, Tebaldo. A troupe of mummers appear and
                    give a performance. In one of the scenes a warrior in armour comes on the stage,
                    bows to Plutus, the god of wealth, and repeats the following lines:--</p>
                <p> "Für Beulen Silber, Gold für Blut Herr, gieb Dein Gut, so schlag ich
                    gut."[3]</p>
                <p>"Plutus was about to give some ingenious answer, but Otto von Trautwangen rose in
                    wrath, laid his hand on his sword and cried: 'Yonder knave disgraces his armour,
                    and I will prove it on his head, if so be he has the courage to meet me.' Half
                    amused, half alarmed, the company gazed at the wrathful young knight, while
                    Tebaldo angrily dismissed the astounded mummers, upbraiding them with the
                    baseness of their shameful inventions, and forbidding them to enter his house
                    again. Hereupon, blushing with shame, he returned to Otto, and in well-chosen,
                    courtly words prayed his guest not to lay it to his charge that the scurvy crew
                    had thought to flatter the rich merchant by thus _outrageously comparing_ his
                    calling with that of arms." The same evening Otto meets at his inn a certain Sir
                    Archimbald, and is seized by the fancy to exchange armour with him, "which,
                    methinks, we may readily do, since we are both of the old High-German heroic
                    stature." In exchange for his coat of silver mail Otto receives a black one. An
                    entire change comes over him with the change of armour, which does not surprise
                    us when we remember the important part dress plays throughout. As a matter of
                    fact, these knights are not much more than stuffed suits of armour. They affect
                    one much as do the figures one sees riding upon armoured wooden horses in the
                    Tower of London or the great armoury in Dresden.</p>
                <p>From the description of one of Otto's earliest single combats we gain an idea of
                    the extraordinary influence attributed to attire. His opponent, Sir Heerdegen,
                    wears a rusty suit of armour, and his rusty voice shouts from behind the bars of
                    his _rusty_ helmet: "Bertha! Bertha!" while from Otto's _silver_ helmet comes in
                    _silvery_ tones the cry: "Gabriele! Gabriele!" When Otto goes back to Tebaldo in
                    his new armour, he has become so much handsomer and more manly, that the young
                    merchant, who happens at the moment to be measuring costly fabrics in his
                    storehouse, is almost ashamed to appear before him. "Then Otto von Trautwangen
                    raised his visor. Tebaldo, half affrighted, fell back, exclaiming: 10 heavens!
                    how you have gained in dignity even since yesterday! And here must I stand
                    before you with an ell-wand in my hand!' Thereupon he flung his beautiful
                    measuring rod against a pillar, shattering it into fragments. It was made of
                    ivory and gold, and his servants could not but believe that this had happened by
                    mischance." They attempt to console their master, but he does not listen to
                    them; all his desire now is to give up his merchant's calling and be allowed to
                    follow Otto as his squire. May not something very like all this be observed
                    to-day in the mutual feelings and demeanour of a Prussian cavalry officer and a
                    Prussian merchant?</p>
                <p>This literature is really literature for cavalry officers. The horses are the
                    only creatures in the book whose psychology Fouqué has successfully mastered,
                    and this for the same reason that he was successful with Undine, namely, that it
                    is elementary psychology. In the romances of our Danish author, Ingemann, the
                    milk-white palfrey and the steel-clad black charger also play important parts.
                    When the Lord High Constable is shown us attired in a scarlet cloak edged with
                    ermine and a white-plumed hat, mounted on a tall iron-grey stallion, his swarthy
                    little squire standing beside him holding the bridle of a nimble, restless
                    Norwegian pony, the author has exhausted all his capacity of character drawing.
                    In the description of the tall iron-grey stallion and the nimble little
                    Norwegian pony we have life-like portraits of the Lord High Constable and his
                    squire.</p>
                <p>It is exactly the same with Fouqué. Sir Folko's horse is described as a
                    slender-necked, light-footed, silver-grey stallion. "At a signal from his rider
                    he approached Gabriele and bent his forelegs, then leaped into the air and
                    caracoled so lightly back to his place that he seemed to be flying, the golden
                    bells on his harness ringing sweet chimes. Perfectly still and obedient he
                    stood, only turning his beautiful head, under its rich trappings, to look
                    caressingly and inquiringly at his master, as if asking: 'Have I done
                    well?'"--Gallantry, sense of honour, loyalty! What more is there in the knights
                    themselves?</p>
                <p>"Sir Archimbald's steed presented a strange contrast. Flecked with white foam,
                    rearing and kicking, he seemed to be about to break the silver chain by which
                    two men-at-arms were holding him back with all their might. His eyes flamed so
                    fiercely that they might well be likened to burning torches, and with his right
                    forefoot he pawed the earth as though he were digging a grave for his master's
                    enemies." --Audacious valour, ardent longing for the fight, indomitable
                    strength! What is there more in the knights?</p>
                <p>Sir Otto's father presents him with a horse. "The youth, hastening down, saw a
                    crowd of men-at-arms collected round a bright brown horse with golden trappings.
                    'Mount,' said his father, 'and make essay if so noble an animal is content to be
                    your property.' Then the young knight Otto von Trautwangen, controlling the
                    animal with a powerful hand, put him through his paces in such a manner that the
                    soldiers, filled with astonishment, felt assured that the noble steed must
                    recognise his destined master, and that in the knight's power over him there lay
                    some strange significance. Sir Otto sprang from his horse and threw himself into
                    his father's arms. Then the charger snorted and kicked wildly at the retainers
                    who grasped at his bridle, and, breaking away from them, followed his young
                    master and laid his head caressingly upon his shoulder."--Invincibility until
                    the destined master, he whose power over the heart is felt to be "of strange
                    significance," appears, and from that moment onwards absolute devotion and the
                    most tender caresses! What else, what more is there in Fouqué's young maidens of
                    high degree?</p>
                <p>It was the fault of the sea-king Arinbjörn that, at the critical moment, Otto
                    lost his beloved and the magic ring. Arinbjörn is riding along a solitary road.
                    A wild bay stallion comes galloping up and makes a furious attack upon the
                    sea-king's horse, and throws him down before his rider can spring from the
                    saddle. Man and horse, lying in a confused heap, are mercilessly kicked by the
                    furious stallion. When we know that the following extraordinary speech of Otto's
                    is made of so sagacious and devoted a horse as this, it does not astonish us so
                    much as it otherwise might: "My horse's colour makes him specially dear to me.
                    For this bright brown is in my eyes a colour of angelic beauty; my blessed
                    mother had great, bright brown eyes, and, as all heaven looked out of them, the
                    colour has always seemed to me like a greeting from heaven."</p>
                <p>Thus does the psychology of the romance of chivalry culminate--psychology of the
                    patrician, or psychology of the horse, call it which you will. In its
                    portraiture of knights hailing from all the ends of the earth, _The Magic Ring_,
                    as Gottschall aptly remarks, confines itself to primary types of humanity and
                    the colouring produced by the sun--we are able to distinguish a Moor from a
                    Finn. This book was followed by many others of the same description, amongst
                    which _Die Fahrten Thiodolfs des Isländers_ ("The Expeditions of Thiodolf the
                    Icelander") is the best known. Thiodolf had been forecast by an earlier work of
                    Fouqué's, the great trilogy, _Der Held des Nordens_ ("The Hero of the North"),
                    which consists of _Sigurd the Serpent Slayer_, _Sigurd's Revenge_, and
                    _Aslauga_. _Der Held des Nordens_ is dedicated to Fichte, and is evidently
                    inspired by the enthusiasm which he had aroused for the olden days of Germany,
                    and for everything characteristically national. The three lyrical-rhetorical
                    "reading-dramas" of which it consists are written in iambics; and where the
                    language becomes particularly impressive or impassioned, short lines are
                    employed, the rhythm and alliteration of which are intended to recall the old
                    Northern metre. The general impression is much the same as that produced by the
                    texts of such of Richard Wagner's operas as deal with the legends of the
                    North.</p>
                <p>The verse, though sometimes laboured, generally rings well, the sentiments are
                    noble and chivalrous, the greatness portrayed is superhuman, yet puerile, the
                    light is not the light of day. The hero's bodily strength and endurance are
                    prodigious. He splits an anvil with one blow; he climbs the outer wall of a high
                    tower, and, when he has looked in at the topmost casement and seen all that he
                    wishes to see, jumps lightly down again. Intellectually he is less
                    remarkable.</p>
                <p>Of this dramatised version of the Volsung Saga Heine writes: "_Sigurd the Serpent
                    Slayer_ is a spirited work, in which the old Scandinavian Saga, with its giants
                    and its witchcraft, is reflected. The hero, Sigurd, is a mighty figure. He is as
                    strong as the Norwegian cliffs, and as wild as the sea that breaks upon them. He
                    has the courage of a hundred lions and the wit of two asses." We may take this
                    last remark as applying to all Fouqué's knightly figures. They are all national
                    portraits, like those we read of in Brentano's story, _Die Mehreren Wehmüller_,
                    those thirty-nine Hungarian types, painted by the artist before he went to
                    Hungary, from amongst which every one afterwards selected his own portrait. In
                    Arnim's and Brentano's writings everything is specialised and characteristic,
                    the situations as well as the personalities; here everything is generalised. A
                    king is always a hero or a stage-king; a queen is either dark and haughty or
                    gentle and fair, &amp;c., &amp;c. The general type is there once for all; the
                    individual features of the "national portraits" are added later.</p>
                <p>The national type, of course, varies with the country. In Denmark, under
                    Frederick VI., the romance of chivalry is patriotic and loyal. In Germany, after
                    the War of Liberation, it is patriotic and aristocratic. In _The Magic Ring_ we
                    read: "The Stranger had seen much of the world, but had remained a true, pious
                    German; nay, it was in foreign lands that he had become one; for distance had
                    revealed to him what a glorious country that old Germany was."</p>
                <p>In both countries the political tendency of Romanticism is the same.</p>
                <p>[1] Ruge, _Werke_, ii. 60, &amp;c.</p>

                <head>XVII</head>
                <head>ROMANTIC POLITICIANS</head>
                <p>In his _Christian Mysticism_ (ii. 39) Görres tells us that one of the most
                    noticeable characteristics of a body which, through regeneration, has attained
                    to higher harmony, is the fragrance it exhales. "Just as a foul odour is
                    indicative of diseased and discordant organic life, so inward harmony is
                    revealed by the fragrance which proceeds from it. Therefore the expression, 'the
                    odour of sanctity' is by no means merely figurative; it is derived from
                    countless well-established instances of sweet odour emanating from persons who
                    lead a holy life." And he quotes numbers of authentic examples of this.</p>
                <p>If Görres is right--and I cast no doubt on his assertion--then the personages to
                    whom, in conclusion, I would direct attention for a moment must have exhaled a
                    most fragrant odour, for they are personages with whom both he and the Church
                    were well pleased. All that is now wanting to complete the picture of the
                    Romantic group, is a characterisation of the men who transferred the principles
                    of Romanticism from the domain of literature into that of practical life and
                    politics. Görres himself may be taken as the representative of Romantic
                    ecclesiasticism, and Friedrich Gentz as in all respects the most interesting of
                    the politicians proper.</p>
                <p>Joseph Görres was born in the Rhine district in 1776. He sat on the same
                    school-bench with Clemens Brentano. At the time when the French armies overran
                    Germany he was completely carried away by the revolutionary movement. Before he
                    had even begun his university studies, he became a member of the Jacobin Club in
                    his native town, Coblentz, distinguished himself by his championship of the
                    ideas of liberty, and, in _Das rothe Blatt_ ("The Red Journal"), provided the
                    German revolutionary party with an organ. To him the past was detestable, France
                    the promised land, and the rest of the world the domain of slavery.</p>
                <p>When, in 1798, the French army marched into Rome, Görres was loud in his
                    rejoicings over the fall of the city and the collapse of the temporal power of
                    the Pope. He writes in _The Red Journal_: "We will tear the mask from
                    ecclesiasticism, and set healthy ideas in circulation everywhere. We too have
                    sworn eternal hatred to priestcraft and monasticism, and work for the good of
                    the people. We at the same time work for the monarchs, by proving their
                    inutility and helping to relieve them from the burden of government."</p>
                <p>His style is youthfully audacious and witty, a genuine demagogue and journalist
                    style. But in his scorn we distinguish a certain fanaticism, which, like all
                    fanaticism, is significant of the possibility of a complete revulsion. When the
                    transactions of the Congress of Rastadt had made it easy to forecast the
                    abolition of the three spiritual electorates, of bishoprics, abbacies, &amp;c.,
                    Görres advertised in his paper, under the heading of "For Sale," the following
                    wares: "A whole cargo of seed of the tree of liberty, the flowers of which make
                    the best bouquets for princes and princesses.... 12,000 human cattle, well
                    broken in, who can shoot, cut and thrust, wheel to the right and wheel to the
                    left. A splendid drilling with cudgel and lash, for twelve years, has brought
                    them to the point of allowing themselves to be shot dead for their masters
                    without so much as a grumble.... Three electoral mitres of finely tanned buffalo
                    hide. The croziers belonging to the same are loaded with lead, conceal daggers,
                    and are decorated with artificial serpents. The eye of God on the top is
                    blind."</p>
                <p>In December 1799 the French occupied Mayence for the second time. When the news
                    reached Coblentz, Görres wrote his wild song of triumph over the collapse of the
                    Roman-German Empire: "At three o'clock in the afternoon of the 30th December
                    1799, the day of the crossing of the Maine, the Holy Roman Empire, of ever
                    foolish memory, passed peacefully away at the advanced age of 955 years, 5
                    months, and 28 days; the cause of death was apoplexy and complete exhaustion,
                    but the illustrious deceased departed in full consciousness and comforted with
                    all the sacraments of the Church.... The deceased was born in Verdun, in June
                    842 (843). At the moment of his birth a comet (_Perrückenkomet_), pregnant with
                    disaster, was flaming in the zenith. The boy was brought up at the courts of
                    Charles the Simple, Louis the Child, and their successors.... But his
                    inclination to a sedentary life, combined with an excess of religious ardour,
                    weakened his already feeble constitution ... and at the age of about 250, at the
                    time of the Crusades, he became quite imbecile," &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Görres here strikes the note which we hear again a generation later in Börne's
                    _Letters from Paris_.</p>
                <p>He contemptuously opens and reads the will of the deceased, according to which
                    the French Republic inherits the left bank of the Rhine, His Excellency, General
                    Bonaparte, being appointed executor.</p>
                <p>This was Görres' stormy youthful period. By the year 1800 he was beginning to
                    withdraw from active politics, a visit to Paris having cured him of his sympathy
                    with Frenchmen. But he was still an ardent progressionist, dreading nothing so
                    much as a return to the past, which would mean a crushing tyranny (harsher after
                    long abeyance and partly justified by existing circumstances), the
                    rehabilitation of the priesthood, and combined political and religious reaction.
                    The oppression of foreign rule aroused his patriotic feeling. At the university
                    of Heidelberg he entered upon his Romantic period. He lectured on the nature of
                    poetry and philosophy, waxed enthusiastic over the Nibelungenlied, studied
                    ancient German history, poetry, and legend. He met his old schoolfellow, Clemens
                    Brentano, became intimate with Arnim, and came into contact with Tieck and the
                    brothers Schlegel and Grimm. It was at Heidelberg that he published his
                    _Kindermythen_ ("Child Myths"), _Die Deutschen Volksbücher_ ("The National
                    Literature of Germany"), and his collection of old German Volkslieder and
                    Meisterlieder.</p>
                <p>It was not only national feeling which the Romantic movement aroused in Görres;
                    it induced an almost equally strong feeling of cosmopolitanism, under the
                    influence of which he took up the study of Persian, a hitherto neglected
                    language, and, almost unassisted, attained such proficiency in it that he was
                    able to produce a tasteful prose translation of Firdusi's epic poetry.</p>
                <p>In 1818 he went to Berlin as spokesman of a deputation from the town of Coblentz.
                    He boldly urged the king to fulfil the promise of a constitution given at the
                    time of the War of Liberation, and his daring was rewarded with disgrace and
                    several years of exile.</p>
                <p>Until 1824 Görres continued to be, to all intents and purposes, the Romantic
                    German patriot. From that year until his death in 1848, he is the champion of
                    the clerical reaction. In his _Deutschland und die Revolution_ (1820) the
                    tendency to Catholicism is already distinct; in it he characterises the
                    Reformation as "a second Fall." He became absorbed in the study of the history
                    of the Middle Ages, and began to regard the Church as the only power capable of
                    satisfactorily defending the liberty of the people from the encroachments of
                    absolutism. Soon, under the influence of Brentano and Franz Baader, he became a
                    believer in visions and bigotedly religious. Clemens Brentano was at this time,
                    like Apollonius of Tyana in days of old, exercising a powerful influence upon a
                    generation predisposed to theosophical extravagances; and Mme. de Krüdener was
                    founding the Holy Alliance.</p>
                <p>As early as 1826, Joseph de Maistre declares that Görres, as author of _Der Kampf
                    der Kirchenfreiheit mit der Staatsgewalt in der Katholischen Schweiz_ ("The
                    Struggle of the Church with State Despotism in Catholic Switzerland"), has
                    championed the cause of the Church with both genius and justice, and yet more
                    boldly and effectually than it has ever been done before. Such praise from such
                    lips carries weight; it indicates, moreover, that we have reached the point at
                    which German Romanticism passes into French, or rather, general European
                    reaction.</p>
                <p>In 1827 Görres published a work which is of interest as forming a prelude to his
                    _Mysticism_, namely, _Emanuel Swedenborg, his Visions and his Relations to the
                    Church_.</p>
                <p>In 1833 Clemens Brentano moved to Munich, where Görres had already settled. The
                    old school friends met once more, and Brentano's influence over Görres was
                    great. Brentano was now entirely given over to superstitious fanaticism. Even
                    Schelling's new philosophy of revelation was not pious enough for him. Talking
                    with some young theologians, he shouted: "It is of no use praising it to me! One
                    drop of holy water is more precious to me than the whole of Schelling's
                    philosophy." He had brought all his memoranda of Catharina Emmerich's visions
                    and outpourings to Munich with him; he no longer needed the Gospels; from her he
                    had learned more of Christ's sayings and journeyings than is to be found in the
                    Scriptures. The saint had even revealed a map of Palestine to him. Görres was
                    soon as firm a believer in miracles and myths as Brentano. Between 1836 and 1842
                    he wrote the four volumes of his _Mysticism_, the most insane book produced by
                    German Romanticism.</p>
                <p>The farther Görres penetrated into the mysteries of witchcraft and sorcery, the
                    more fanciful and peculiar did he himself become. He believed that he was
                    possessed by an evil spirit. On one occasion he complained that the devil,
                    provoked by his interference in Satanic affairs, had stolen one of his
                    manuscripts; it was, however, found some time afterwards in his bookcase.</p>
                <p>When the religious disturbances broke out in Cologne, Görres came forward as the
                    spokesman of the Ultramontanes in their dispute with the Prussian Ministry. His
                    passionate diatribes against Protestantism were couched in Biblical
                    language--his opponents were a brood of vipers, the Prussian State was possessed
                    by an evil spirit, &amp;c. This particular demon he describes as a horrible
                    ghost, "whom it is honouring too much to call a spirit;" it is, he says, the
                    ghost of the demon which in the Prussian army of our grandfathers' days handled
                    the whip which flogged seven backs at a time.</p>
                <p>Görres won the admiration of Count Montalembert, the leader of the French
                    Catholics, by his polemical feats. In Catholic Germany he was regarded as a
                    father of the Church, and called "the Catholic Luther." He succeeded in drawing
                    the Bavarian Government into the movement; the opponents of the Protestant
                    Prussian Government were allowed to publish their lucubrations unchecked in the
                    Bavarian press, and it was Görres' hope that Bavaria, as an important Catholic
                    power, would openly take up the contest.</p>
                <p>No expression of politico-religious fanaticism was too outrageous for him. He
                    went the length of declaring that the Government, by permitting mixed marriages,
                    compelled the Catholic parent to bring up "twofold bastards"--and this in the
                    face of the fact that the King of Bavaria was the son of a Protestant mother and
                    had married a Protestant wife.</p>
                <p>At the time of the violent dispute as to the authenticity of the coat of the
                    Saviour preserved at Trèves, Görres was highly delighted with the success of a
                    pilgrimage to Trèves, which was promptly organised, and in which the
                    Rhinelanders, to the number of a million, took part, in order to annoy the
                    Protestant Prussians. To him this pilgrimage was "the triumph of the victorious
                    Church." The argument that the holy garment could not be genuine, seeing that
                    several other places possessed similar coats, he dismissed with a reference to
                    the miraculous multiplication of loaves recorded in the New Testament.[1]</p>
                <p>The Romantic literary theory that manner is something absolutely independent of
                    matter, was a theory put into practice in politics by Friedrich von Gentz. We
                    called Kleist the German Mérimée; for several reasons Gentz might be called the
                    German Talleyrand. In his mature years he might, like Metternich, have written
                    under his own portrait: "Nur kein Pathos!" ("Anything except pathos!") He is the
                    very embodiment of Romantic irony, the incarnate spirit of _Lucinde_. He does
                    not, however, become a typical figure until he is over forty, at the time when a
                    period of diplomatic activity succeeded to revolutionary upheavals and the
                    Napoleonic wars, the time when the watchword was reaction, that is to say,
                    quiet--quiet at any price, extinction of all the European conflagrations, and
                    rest, profound rest for the sick, the weary, and the convalescent peoples; when
                    consequently, as in a sick room, the great aim was to get rid as quietly as
                    possible of disturbers of the peace and prevent all noise and uproar. "Gentz,"
                    says Gottschall, "understood how to give to the official publications that
                    indescribable polish, that classic smoothness, that Olympian dignity which,
                    untouched by the fate of mortals, allows no drop of nectar and ambrosia to be
                    spilled from the cup of the gods, though blood may be flowing in torrents in the
                    regions below. This distinguished manner of passing lightly over the small
                    shocks by which nations were shattered into fragments, gave a complexion of
                    mildness and grace to the despotic policy of the day. One heard only a puff, not
                    a report; it was the noiseless slaughter of the air-gun."</p>
                <p>To outward seeming, Legitimist principles were being vindicated; in point of
                    fact, their vindicators were not Legitimists when their interests bade them be
                    the reverse. In them Goethe's words were fulfilled: "None are so Legitimist as
                    those who can legitimise themselves." The cause Gentz championed was a bad
                    cause, but even the champion of a bad cause is interesting if possessed of
                    remarkable talent. And Gentz was talented in an extraordinary degree. Varnhagen
                    rightly said of him: "Never has the dust of German scholarship been stirred up
                    with greater _éclat_; never has learning been displayed to such advantage."</p>
                <p>Friedrich von Gentz was born in Breslau in 1764. Both his parents belonged to the
                    middle classes; his future exalted position in society he owed entirely to his
                    own ability. At the University of Königsberg he applied himself seriously to the
                    study of Kant's philosophy, at the same time cultivating an enthusiastic
                    Platonic friendship for an unhappy young married woman, Elisabeth Graun. In 1786
                    he went to Berlin, obtained a Government appointment, and made a _mariage de
                    convenance_ with the daughter of a high official in the finance department. He
                    plunged into a course of unbridled dissipation, and took part in all the foolish
                    pleasures of a court "in which a repulsive assemblage of roués and bigoted women
                    surrounded the old king, Frederick William II."</p>
                <p>In the midst of such a life as this he was surprised by the French Revolution.
                    Its first effect was to fire him with youthful enthusiasm. "If this revolution
                    were to fail," he wrote, "I should deem it one of the greatest misfortunes which
                    has befallen mankind. It is the first practical triumph of philosophy, the first
                    example of a form of government founded upon principles and a coherent system.
                    It is hope and comfort for our race, which is groaning under so many ancient
                    evils. Should this revolution fail, these evils will be more irremediable than
                    before. I can picture so clearly to myself how the silence of despair would
                    acknowledge, in defiance of reason, that men can only be happy as slaves, and
                    how all tyrants, great and small, would take advantage of this dreadful
                    acknowledgment to avenge themselves for the terror caused them by the awakening
                    of the French nation."</p>
                <p>But the horrors which the French Revolution brought in its train soon caused him
                    to change his mind. He suddenly became the ardent champion of the good old days.
                    To combat the supremacy of public opinion and the follies of the masses became
                    the object of his life. He was incapable of seeing in the French Revolution the
                    necessary outcome of centuries of wrong and ferment; he declared the cause of
                    its lawlessness to be "enlightenment," the inordinate cultivation of cold
                    reason--a characteristically Romantic theory.</p>
                <p>No doubt there was a species of real development at the root of this change. The
                    "rights of humanity," which he had so warmly defended in his treatise _Ueber den
                    Ursprung und die obersten Prinzipien des Rechts_ ("On the Origin and Main
                    Principles of Rights"), now seemed to him only of importance to the statesman as
                    "elementary preparatory studies." The theory of these rights appeared to him to
                    stand in much the same relation to statecraft as the mathematical theory of
                    projectiles does to bomb-throwing. And now, by slow degrees, he arrives at the
                    narrow view that it is not the people, but the Government, which is the chief
                    power in the state. He regards the co-operation of the people in legislation as
                    a mere form; liberty has shrunk into willing, glad obedience.</p>
                <p>Intercourse with Wilhelm von Humboldt, and the influence of the æsthetic ideas of
                    the period on the need for harmony between private and public life, somewhat
                    softened the severity of these principles, and the English constitution became
                    Gentz's ideal. When Frederick William III. ascended the throne, he actually felt
                    impelled to present a petition to his Majesty, in which, in eloquent language,
                    he called upon him to concede liberty of the press--the very liberty which he
                    described a few years later as the source of all evil. The loyal Goethe was
                    astounded by this attempt "to coerce" the sovereign, and as the King took no
                    notice of the appeal, Gentz at once let the matter drop, and did his best to
                    bury it in oblivion. From this time onward he was in the pay of England; he did
                    not exactly sell himself, but he accepted regular and considerable monetary
                    rewards for his political activity in English interests. And Gentz needed money.
                    He gambled for high stakes, and lived a life of perpetual dissipation and
                    revelry with actresses and ballet-dancers. At times this was interrupted by fits
                    of extreme sentimentality, when, as he writes, he lived "a pleasant, but still
                    wild life" with his own wife. In April 1801 he notes in his diary: "Profound
                    emotion over the death of a dog." During a visit to Weimar, where he met all the
                    literary notabilities of the day, he became desperately enamoured of the
                    poetess, Amalie von Imhoff, and made determined resolutions to lead a better
                    life. But he had hardly returned to Berlin before he wrote: "Result of my Weimar
                    resolutions --on December 23rd lost all I possessed at hazard." For a time he
                    went on writing letters of six or eight sheets to Amalie von Imhoff; then he
                    fell madly in love with the actress, Christel Eigensatz, and forgot everything
                    else. "_Maintenant c'est le délire complet_," he writes in his diary. In the
                    midst of all this, his wife leaves him and applies for a divorce. The evening
                    she leaves, Gentz tries to forget the unpleasantness in playing _trente et
                    quarante_. When Berlin had for many reasons become disagreeable, nay,
                    impossible, he accepted the offer of an Austrian Government appointment in
                    Vienna. Here he gradually surrendered all independence and became the tool of
                    Metternich.</p>
                <p>But before this happened, Gentz had had his period of greatness. The apathy with
                    which the Viennese accommodated themselves to French supremacy, to defeats and
                    humiliations without end, roused all that there was of energy and genius in him.
                    The burning hatred of Napoleon by which he was inspired made him for a short
                    time, during their misfortunes and deep depression, the Demosthenes of the
                    German people. But it was only independence that he so passionately desired, not
                    liberty. In Napoleon the whole Revolution seemed to him to be concentrated.
                    Against him he would not have hesitated to employ even such a means as
                    assassination. He strove with all his might to bring about a union between the
                    German powers and to rouse the German people. But, true to his character, he
                    appealed less to the people than to the chosen few in whose hands it seemed to
                    him that the destiny of the people lay. His preface to the _Political
                    Fragments_, his manifestoes and proclamations of war, are written with
                    passionate vigour, in a fluent, magniloquent, and yet manly style, the
                    rhetorical flourish of which is never in bad taste. Even the defeats of Ulm and
                    Austerlitz did not crush him; but it was with deep dejection that he observed
                    the miserable condition of affairs in Prussia before the battle of Jena. When
                    Johannes von Müller, and others upon whom he had relied, allowed themselves to
                    be flattered and won over by Napoleon, Gentz remained immovably firm. In the
                    famous letter to Müller he makes scathing allusion to those "whose lives are an
                    incessant capitulation." But when Austria gave up the struggle, and, as
                    generally happens in such cases, frivolity and pleasure-seeking increased in
                    proportion to the defeats and humiliations suffered by the country, Gentz too
                    was soon so deeply entangled in the wild whirl of stupefying dissipations that,
                    in his terrible pecuniary difficulties, he caught at an alliance with Metternich
                    as a drowning man at a plank. The influence on a character like his of the man
                    whom Talleyrand called the "weekly politician," because his range of vision
                    never extended beyond that period, and whom a distinguished Russian called
                    "varnished dust," was no happy one.</p>
                <p>Henceforward Gentz's letters are full of complaints of "such mental lassitude,
                    despondency, emptiness, and indifference" as he had hitherto neither known nor
                    imagined, and which he aptly describes as a "sort of intellectual consumption."
                    He calls himself "damnably blasé." "Believe me," he writes to Rahel, "I am
                    damnably blasé. I have seen and enjoyed so much of the world that I am no longer
                    influenced by its illusive grandeur and rewards." "Nothing delights me; I am
                    cold, blasé, contemptuous, thoroughly persuaded of the folly of almost every one
                    else, unduly certain of my own--not wisdom--but clear-sightedness, and inwardly
                    devilish glad that the so-called great doings are coming to such a laughable
                    end." So indifferent has he become, that Napoleon's downfall, which he had
                    formerly so ardently desired, arouses no deeper feeling in him than this. "I
                    have become terribly old and bad," he himself confesses with an amiable
                    effrontery which reminds us of Friedrich Schlegel, and which never deserted
                    him.</p>
                <p>It is about this time that he begins to be persistently haunted by the fear of
                    death; he now regularly notes in his diary the exact degree to which the feeling
                    is weighing upon him. His letters betray all the weaknesses of a nervous woman.
                    The correspondence between him and Adam Müller is particularly ludicrous. We are
                    never allowed to forget that they are both afraid of thunder. But even a letter
                    is sometimes more than Gentz can bear. He writes to Müller: "Your letters
                    shatter my tender nerves." His fear of death most frequently took the form of
                    fear of being murdered. After the assassination of Kotzebue by Sand, his terror
                    lest he also might fall a victim to the hatred of the Liberal youth of Germany
                    reached such a climax that the sight of a sharp knife was sometimes enough, as
                    he himself confesses, to bring on a fainting-fit. In 1814 he writes to Rahel:
                    "Now, God be praised, all is at an end in Paris. I am, thank God, very well. I
                    live sometimes at Baden, sometimes in Vienna, have sometimes brioches with
                    exquisite butter for breakfast, sometimes other heavenly cakes. I have come into
                    possession of furniture that makes my heart leap for joy, and I am far less
                    afraid of death."</p>
                <p>He now looks to Görres as the only person who can write, he himself being
                    incapable of any kind of production. Yet at this very time he occupies such an
                    exalted position in society that he can deny himself to crowned heads. On the
                    31st of October, 1814, he writes in his diary: "_Refusé le prince royal de
                    Bavière, le roi de Danemark_," &amp;c. He meets Talleyrand, and admires him
                    excessively. To give this admiration a practical direction, the astute French
                    diplomatist presents him with 24,000 florins in the name of the King of France.
                    At the close of 1814 Gentz writes in his diary: "The aspect of public affairs is
                    melancholy.... But, since I have nothing to reproach myself with, my accurate
                    knowledge of the pitiful doings of all these petty beings who rule the world, so
                    far from distressing, only serves to amuse me; I enjoy it all like a play given
                    for my private delectation." Is not this like a speech of Jean Paul's Roquairol?
                    Tired of life, whatever disturbs his peace is objectionable to him. It is now
                    his object to maintain the existing condition of things at any price. In 1815,
                    in argument with Görres, he actually defends the Peace of Paris. He was too
                    sagacious and cold, too great a hater of phrases, not to sneer at the
                    "Burschenschaften" (students' leagues), the agitation for a national German
                    dress, the Teutoburgerwald enthusiasm, and others of the same description;
                    nevertheless, the assassination of Kotzebue was made a pretext for forbidding
                    the formation of patriotic societies, as further assassinations and crimes were
                    feared. It was owing to Gentz's exertions that the universities were placed
                    under control and that the press was gagged. Of the liberty of the press he now
                    writes: "I hold to my opinion, that, to prevent abuse of the press, nothing
                    should be printed for a certain number of years. This as the rule, with a very
                    few exceptions permitted by a thoroughly competent court, would in a short time
                    lead us back to God and the truth."</p>
                <p>His utterances on the occasion of the Greek war of liberation prove that, in
                    spite of his reactionary ardour, he had too much sense to believe, like Adam
                    Müller and the rest, in the principle of legitimacy and the divine right of
                    kings as revealed truths. He had written to Müller in 1818: "You are the only
                    man in Germany of whom I say: He writes divinely when he chooses; and nothing in
                    our audacious days astonishes and exasperates me more than the audacity of those
                    who dare to measure themselves with you.... Your system is a completed, rounded
                    whole. It would be vain to attack it from any side. One can only be entirely in
                    it or entirely outside of it. If you can prove to us, make comprehensible to us,
                    that all real knowledge, all true understanding of nature, all good laws and
                    social regulations, nay, even history itself (as you somewhere assert), are, and
                    can only be, communicated to us by divine revelation, then (as far as I am
                    concerned at least) you have gained the day. As long as you do not succeed in
                    doing this, we stand afar off, admire you, love you, but are separated from you
                    by an impassable gulf." It must be remembered that Adam Müller had gone the
                    length of asserting that the existence of the Holy Trinity sufficiently proves
                    that any national economical system based upon one single principle must be a
                    wrong system. It even proves to him the necessity of the "Dreifelderwirthschaft"
                    (triennal rotation of crops). Now, when Greece revolts, Gentz writes that the
                    principle of legitimacy, being the production of time, must be modified by time,
                    and makes the following noteworthy assertion: "I have always been aware that, in
                    spite of the majesty and power of my employers, and in spite of all the single
                    victories gained by us, the spirit of the times would in the long-run prove
                    stronger than we are; that the press, contemptible as it is in its excesses,
                    would prove its superiority to all our wisdom; and that neither diplomatic art
                    nor violence would be able to hold back the wheel of the world."</p>
                <p>In his sixty-fifth year, the worn-out, gouty, suffering old man was taken
                    possession of by two passions strangely out of keeping with his age and the bent
                    of his mind. It was a momentary return of youth. The one was for the famous
                    ballet-dancer, Fanny Elsler, at that time a girl of nineteen. His infatuation
                    for her knew no bounds. He writes: "I have won her simply and solely by the
                    magic power of my love. Until she knew me she did not know that such love
                    existed.... Think of the bliss of daily undisturbed intercourse with a being
                    whose every attribute enraptures me ... in whose eyes, and hands, and every
                    separate charm I can absorb myself for hours, whose voice bewitches me, and with
                    whom I can carry on endless conversations; for I am educating her with fatherly
                    solicitude, and she is the aptest of pupils, a pupil who is at once my beloved
                    and my child."</p>
                <p>The other surprising passion was for Heine's _Buch der Lieder_, then just
                    published. It was all very well for the old reactionary to call the audacious
                    poet a "crazy adventurer;" he could not resist his sorcery. "I am still," he
                    writes, "refreshing myself with the _Buch der Lieder_. Like Prokesch, I bathe
                    for hours in these melancholy waters. Even the poems which verge upon actual
                    blasphemy I cannot read without the most profound emotion; I sometimes blame
                    myself that I so often and gladly return to them." His receptive nature could
                    not withstand them. He has rightly described himself as a woman. In a strain
                    which reminds us of the hermaphroditic traits in _Lucinde_, he writes to Rahel:
                    "Do you know the reason why the relation between us is such a perfect one? I
                    will tell you. It is because you are an infinitely productive and I am an
                    infinitely receptive being: you are a great man; I am the first of all the women
                    who have ever lived."</p>
                <p>He was now so nervous that a vigorous handclasp would alarm him; even the sight
                    of a martial moustache was enough to disquiet him. In well-intentioned
                    travellers who came to make his acquaintance he saw assassins in disguise. In
                    the last year of his life his back was bent, his gait timorous and unsteady. The
                    clear, sagacious eyes, for which he had been remarkable as a youth, were now, as
                    it were, veiled by their furtive expression. In company he fortified himself by
                    wearing large black spectacles.</p>
                <p>One day at a fête, Fanny Elsler, presenting him with a foaming glass of champagne
                    which she had tasted, said teasingly: "Der Krug geht so lange zu Wasser, his er
                    bricht" (German proverb--The pitcher goes often to the well, but comes home
                    broken at last). Gentz replied: "It will anyhow last out my time and
                    Metternich's." His standpoint is indicated and judged in these words.</p>
                <p>In religious matters Gentz was extraordinarily vacillating. At one time he would
                    declare that religion was to him simply a matter of politics; at another, though
                    he never actually went over to Catholicism, he would, in Romantic fashion, make
                    great concessions to it. He prostrated himself at the feet of the Catholic
                    mystic, Adam Müller, who literally took Napoleon to be the devil incarnate
                    (writing, for instance, to Gentz in July 1806, that "as Christians we must
                    subdue the Bonaparte within us"); and, when petitioning the Emperor for an
                    appointment in Austria, he gave as one of his reasons for leaving Prussia, "my
                    long-felt enmity to Protestantism, in the original character and increasingly
                    evil tendencies of which I believe I have discovered, after much and careful
                    proving of the matter, _the root of all the corruption of our times, and one of
                    the main causes of the decay of Europe._"</p>
                <p>In politics he is the representative of unequivocal, conscious reaction, and he
                    does not, like some other hypocritical reactionaries, fight shy of the word. In
                    a letter written at Verona in 1822, he relates that at a dinner-party at
                    Metternich's he has just met Chateaubriand, who has been extremely amiable and
                    complimentary to him. "In the course of conversation he mentioned it as a
                    remarkable phenomenon, one which could not possibly escape the notice of the
                    historian, that four or five years ago, when the condition of Europe seemed
                    quite hopeless, a mere handful of men--not more than could be counted on one's
                    fingers--had determined to combat the Revolution, and that these men had been so
                    successful that to-day they were taking the field, with Governments and armies
                    supporting them, against the common enemy. As marking the most important moments
                    in this _bold reaction_, he mentioned the founding of _Le Conservateur_, and the
                    Congress of Karlsbad. He looks forward to the future with sanguine courage,
                    regarding the victory of the good cause as certain. All true power and real
                    talent are upon our side, contained in some ten or twelve heads. Nothing could
                    be more dangerous for us than to attach too much importance to the attacks of
                    the Revolutionaries, or to be in any way afraid of these said Revolutionaries,
                    who, for all their uproar, are mere babblers. I could scarcely conceive, he
                    added, how such men as Benjamin Constant, Guizot, and Royer-Collard had sunk in
                    the public estimation. This and more he said, not with any fire and eagerness,
                    but calmly and coldly."</p>
                <p>Gentz was far from guessing, when he penned these words, how great a surprise
                    this same man held in store for him. Two years later the event occurred which
                    forms the turning-point, the watershed, as it were, in the spiritual history of
                    the first half of the century, namely, Chateaubriand's dismissal from the
                    Ministry and entrance into the ranks of the Liberal opposition, whose leader he
                    became. It was this event in combination with Byron's death, which happened
                    about the same time, that called Liberalism throughout the whole world to
                    arms.</p>
                <p>Gentz could not control his wrath. After the appearance of Chateaubriand's
                    article in the _Journal des Débats_ on the abolition of the censorship, he wrote
                    to a friend: "I subscribe to every word you say about Chateaubriand. It is long
                    since anything has agitated and incensed me in the manner this really villainous
                    article has done. It is the work of a man who, because he has not succeeded in
                    disturbing the peace of his enemies with drums and pipes, grasps a torch and
                    sets fire to the roof over their heads. Not that there is anything
                    incomprehensible in such a performance, for Frenchmen are now at liberty to do
                    whatever they please; and the man who, in his vindictive antagonism, could
                    immediately violate every sense of duty, honour, and decorum, as this monster
                    did on the third day after his dismissal, was bound in the end, irritated by the
                    feeling of his own impotence, to go as far as he could without running the risk
                    of imprisonment--a risk practically non-existent in his country." But all
                    Gentz's wrath could not check the current of events, and before long the
                    reaction which he represents was struggling in its death throes.</p>
                <p>In a letter to Pilat, written in 1820, he writes: "What is Duller, what is La
                    Mennais, what (with the exception of Bonald) are all the writers of our day in
                    comparison with Maistre? His book _On the Pope_ is, to my mind, the greatest and
                    most important of the last half century. You have not read it, or you could not
                    have failed to mention it. Take my advice--do not read it _à batons rompus_,
                    amidst the noise and distractions with which you are constantly surrounded, but
                    keep it for a time when you have unbroken quiet and can concentrate your
                    thoughts. Your so-called friends must know the book, but not a word do they say
                    of it. Such meat is too strong for these lukewarm, critical souls. It has cost
                    me some sleepless nights, but what enjoyment have they not purchased me!
                    Profundity of thought in combination with astonishing erudition and with
                    political insight superior to Montesquieu's, the eloquence of a Burke, and an
                    enthusiasm which at times rises to the height of genuine poetry--to this add the
                    characteristics of the man of the world, adroitness, refinement, the knack of
                    sparing the feelings of the individual whilst treading his doctrines and
                    opinions under foot, a prodigious knowledge of men and things--and think of it
                    all employed in such a cause, to produce such results! Yes; now I fully and
                    firmly believe that the Church will never fall. If such a star made its
                    appearance in her sky but once in a century, she would not only stand, but
                    prevail. The book has _some_ weak points! I say this in order that my admiration
                    may not seem blind--but they are lost like spots in the sun. Others before
                    Maistre may have felt what the Pope is, but no other writer has expressed it as
                    he has done. This extraordinary book, which the contemptible generation of
                    to-day barely condescends to notice, represents the labour of half a lifetime.
                    The author, now a man of more than seventy, has evidently been engaged upon it
                    for twenty years. A monument should be erected to him in one of the great
                    churches of Rome. Kings should take counsel with him. As a matter of fact, after
                    he has exhausted his private means, all that he has obtained from his
                    Government, and that not without difficulty, is the title of Minister, and an
                    income sufficient to live upon in Turin with the greatest economy. Never has a
                    human being had a better right to say to his children:--</p>
                <p> 'Disce puer virtutem ex me, verumque laborem, Fortunam ex aliis!'</p>
                <p>What a man! and how few of our contemporaries even know that he exists!"</p>
                <p>Here, again, we are at a point where the German reaction passes, as it were, into
                    the French.[2]</p>
                <p>The German reaction is in its essence literary, the French political and
                    religious. The former gradually glides into Catholicism, the latter is openly
                    and consistently Catholic. In every domain, indeed, the French reaction upholds
                    the principle of traditional authority, and De Maistre is its most earnest and
                    most high-minded, as well as one of its most gifted representatives. The witty
                    and vigorous panegyrist of the headsman and champion of the _auto da fé_ is the
                    conscientious, ardent antagonist of enlightenment and humanitarian ideals.</p>
                <p>The German Romanticists loved twilight and moonshine. The blazing daylight of
                    rationalism and the lightning flashes of the French Revolution had driven them
                    to seek comfort in the dusk. But what is even Novalis's love of night in
                    comparison with Joseph de Maistre's glorification of darkness!</p>
                <p>Ancient legend tells that Phaëton, the son of Apollo, being allowed one day to
                    drive his father's chariot, guided it so carelessly that the sun scorched the
                    whole earth and set many of its cities on fire. The fable adds, that a whole
                    race of men were so terrified that they with one accord cried to the gods to
                    grant them eternal darkness. De Maistre is a descendant of that race, and a man
                    who has some claim to greatness because of his gifts, his faith in Providence,
                    and his contempt for his fellow-men. And to this day there exist descendants of
                    the race; but these have degenerated into dwarfish figures, who assert
                    themselves the more the more insignificant and timid they are. Their cry, too,
                    is "Darkness! more darkness!" The more devoid they are of ideas and aims, the
                    louder they cry, and their only faith is faith in the power of darkness.</p>
                <p>Those who, in studying the history of German Romanticism, pay special attention
                    to the growth of the reaction against the spirit of the eighteenth century, are
                    struck by the inferiority of the German Romanticists in single-minded strength
                    of character to such a reactionary as De Maistre. It is to be remembered,
                    however, that they were not statesmen and politicians, but authors; even those
                    among them who, like Gentz, represent the transition from literature to
                    politics, have no real significance except as writers.</p>
                <p>From the purely literary point of view the Romantic School in Germany possesses
                    permanent interest. One has but to compare it with the equivalent groups in
                    other lands to be fully impressed by the originality and intellectual importance
                    of its members.</p>
                <p>A Romantic current is perceptible in the first decades of this century in almost
                    every country in Europe; but only in Germany, England, and France is the
                    movement a distinctly original and important one; only in those countries is it
                    a European "main current." What we observe in the Slavonic countries is more or
                    less an echo of English Romanticism.</p>
                <p>The Romantic literature of Scandinavia is strongly influenced by that of
                    Germany.</p>
                <p>In Sweden, where Romanticism was known by the name of "Phosphorism," or "new
                    school," it attacked (as was its wont) French taste in literature, in this
                    instance represented by the Swedish Academy. In 1807 the "Aurora Society" was
                    founded by Atterbom, Hammarsköld, and Palmblad. The principles it proclaimed
                    were in all essentials those of the German Romantic School. Atterbom's symbolism
                    reminds us of Tieck's; Stagnelius has a certain resemblance to Novalis. The
                    movement has, nevertheless, distinctly national characteristics.</p>
                <p>In Norway the lonely Wergeland, in spite of his highly susceptible, enthusiastic
                    temperament, is a living protest against the German Romantic spirit; but Andreas
                    Munch is a pronounced Romanticist of the German type. And such undertakings as
                    the re-writing and publication of the Norwegian fairy tales (Asbjörnson and Moe)
                    and the collecting of the Norwegian national songs (Landstad) are due to the
                    impulse which the Romanticists' predilection for everything national
                    communicated to the minds of the men of the North.</p>
                <p>In Denmark the connection between German and native Romanticism is of a very
                    complex nature. As a rule, the Danish poets receive their first impulse from
                    Germany, but afterwards strike out paths for themselves. Oehlenschläger was
                    awakened by Steffens and strongly influenced in the early years of the century
                    by Tieck. It was under the influence of German Romanticism that Grundtvig
                    renounced his youthful rationalism; and his patriotism and nationalism have
                    strong points of correspondence with Arndt's and Jahn's. The influence of Fouqué
                    and Hoffmann is apparent in Ingemann; Hauch is an enthusiastic admirer of
                    Novalis; J. L. Heiberg, as the dramatiser of fairy tales, is a pupil of Tieck;
                    Hans Christian Andersen, as the fantastic story-teller, the pupil of Hoffmann.
                    Shack Staffeldt, German born, is a full-blown Romanticist, a devout worshipper
                    of "the blue flower."</p>
                <p>But though foreign influence, as this work sufficiently shows, is everywhere
                    traceable, the independent, national and Scandinavian characteristics of Danish
                    Romanticism are, nevertheless, unmistakable and strong.</p>

        <head><pb n="viii"/> INTRODUCTION</head>

        <p>It is my intention to trace in the poetry of England of the first decades of this
          century, the course of the strong, deep, pregnant current in the intellectual life of the
          country, which, sweeping away the classic forms and conventions, produces a Naturalism
          dominating the whole of literature, which from Naturalism leads to Radicalism, from revolt
          against traditional convention in literature to vigorous rebellion against religious and
          political reaction, and which bears in its bosom the germs of all the liberal ideas and
          emancipatory achievements of the later periods of European civilisation.</p>

        <p>The literary period which I now proceed to describe is a vigorous, highly productive one.
          It has authors and schools of the most dissimilar types, sometimes not merely unlike, but
          antagonistic to, each other. Though the connection between these authors and schools is
          not self-evident, but only discernible to the understanding, critical eye, yet the period
          has its unity, and the picture it presents, though a many-coloured, restless one, is a
          coherent composition, the work of the great artist, history.</p>

        <head type="add">1. Universal Characteristics of the Period</head>
        <head>I. UNIVERSAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PERIOD</head>
        
        <p>One of the first and chief things observable in this English literary group, is that it
          has certain characteristics in common with the whole European intellectual tendency of the
          period. These characteristics are universal because of the universal existence of their
          cause. Napoleon was threatening Europe with a world-wide Empire. To escape annihilation,
          all the threatened nationalities either instinctively or deliberately re-invigorated
          themselves from the sources of their national life. The national spirit is awakened and
          spreads and grows in Germany during the War of Liberation; in Russia it bursts into flames
          along with the ancient capital of the country; in England it inspires enthusiasm for
          Wellington and Nelson, and vindicates in bloody battles, from the Nile to Waterloo, the
          ancient English claim to the sovereignty of the sea; in Denmark the cannonade of the
          battle of Copenhagen awakens a new national spirit and produces a new literature. It is
          this patriotic spirit which leads all the different nations to the eager study of their
          own history and their own customs, their own legends and folk-lore. The devotion to
          everything national incites to the study and the literary representation of the
          »people«–that is to say, the lower classes of society, with whom the literature of the
          eighteenth century had not concerned itself. The reaction against French as a universal
          language brings even dialect into high repute.</p>

        <p>In <emph>Germany</emph>, as we have already seen, patriotism led to <pb n="2"/> enthusiasm for the country's
          past, for the Middle Ages–their faith, their superstitions, and their social order. In
          <emph>Italy</emph> we have, in Manzoni's religious verse, an apparent return to Catholicism. The
          faith which had petrified into dogma, and meant renunciation of the flesh, is upheld as
          synonymous with poetry and morality; it is transformed from a religion into an art
          <emph>motif</emph>. Manzoni's religious enthusiasm is the same enthusiasm as that which accompanied
          the Pope back to Rome and inspired Alexander with the idea of the Holy Alliance. Even
          <emph>France</emph>, the country which had produced Napoleon, was driven by the spirit of the age
          into a path leading in much the same direction as that taken by Germany; the new French
          literary movement was directed against the Academy, against the so-called classical,
          <emph>i.e.</emph>, universal, cosmopolitan literature; the age of Louis XIV. was neglected, and the
          poets of the sixteenth century, Du Bellay, Ronsard, nay, even the poor grotesque poets
          whom Boileau had scoffed at and rejected, came into vogue again. (Victor Hugo's attack on
          the literary opinions of the period previous to his own; Sainte-Beuve's earliest literary
          criticism; Théophile Gautier's <emph>Les Grotesques</emph>.) In <emph>Denmark</emph> at the beginning of the
          century it was mainly in the wake of the German current that men's minds moved. They
          assumed an antagonistic attitude to French culture. But in the second and equally
          important stage of the literary movement, the antagonism becomes an antagonism to
          everything foreign, and more especially to Germany, which had for so long played the part
          of the oppressor in Denmark.</p>

        <p>In <emph>England</emph> we find the same essential features which distinguish the movement in all
          the other countries. The influence of France, which in the eighteenth century had been
          paramount in the upper classes of society, was shaken off. Pope, the last poet of the
          classical school, did not long remain a master in the eyes of the younger generation. They
          began to pluck at the little man's elaborate wig and trample over the trim beds of his
          garden. And now it became apparent what a powerful intellectual reserve force the British
          nation possessed in those countries which lay remote from the centre of political life,
          fresh, unexhausted <pb n="3"/> by civilisation. Ireland, which in the eighteenth century had produced
          such a thinker as Swift and such a writer as Goldsmith, owned a treasury of lovely
          melodies which, as soon as a great lyric poet lent them words, were poured forth by all
          the singing throats of Europe. The Welsh collected and published their old songs and
          poems. And in Scotland, to which country the mean, depressing conditions prevailing among
          the English industrial classes had not as yet spread, but where a people, proud of its
          past and its land, preserved its national songs, its superstitions, and its political
          peculiarities, there appeared in the second half of the eighteenth century, as a protest
          against cold reason and artificiality in poetry, Macpherson's <emph>Ossian</emph>. The influence of
          <emph>Ossian</emph> was alike great upon Alfieri and Foscolo in Italy, upon Herder and Goethe in
          Germany, and upon Chateaubriand in France. On it follow in England Percy's collection of
          old English, and in Scotland Walter Scott's collection of Scotch, ballads.</p>

        <p>But in the interval between these two publications our attention is demanded by one of
          those literary currents flowing from one country to another and back again, which it is
          our chief aim to trace, and which in this case is remarkably plain. Not long after Percy's
          <emph>Reliques</emph> appeared, a luckless young German lawyer in Government employ, Bürger by name,
          was appointed to a small post in Göttingen, where he lived in straitened circumstances and
          in unhappy and demoralising marital relations with two sisters. Into this man's house
          Percy's book finds its way. It makes a powerful impression on him, and fires him with the
          desire to write something which had long been proscribed by the rules of poetical art, but
          which he himself calls (to Baggesen, see <emph>The Labyrinth</emph>) poetry proper, namely, a ballad.
          He begins the famous <emph>Lenore</emph> and works at it slowly, week after week, with such a
          conviction of the importance of the step he is taking that his letters to his friends are
          full of nothing else. The ballad appears, and is soon read in every country in Europe. In
          the year 1795 an Edinburgh young lady introduces it to the notice of another lawyer in
          Crown employ; and this young man, Walter Scott by name, who was also to be an author, and
          a very much greater one, makes his <pb n="4"/> literary <emph>début</emph> with a translation of <emph>Lenore</emph> and
          another ballad of Bürger's, <emph>The Wild Huntsman</emph>. His translations meeting with a
          favourable reception, Scott began to regard himself as a poet. And it was upon the basis
          of these translations and that of <emph>Götz von Berlichingen</emph>, which he published in 1799,
          that the national Scottish Romanticism of his poetry was founded.</p>

        <p>There is, then, originally in this literature a distinct trace of the general European
          reaction against the eighteenth century. The strong national feeling which superseded the
          feeling of cosmopolitanism is to be found in England in Wordsworth in the form of
          patriotic poetical description, in Southey in the form of eulogy (at times partly, at
          times purely, official) of the Royal Family and the national exploits, in the
          Scottish-born Campbell in the form of passionately British songs of liberty and war;
          whilst Scott and Moore are positive literary personifications of Scotland and Ireland. The
          universal return to the popular has its chief representative and spokesman in Wordsworth,
          whose special theme is the life of the lower and lowest classes. The predilection for the
          Middle Ages is strongest in Scott, who combines the antiquarian's delight in memories and
          survivals of the past with the Tory politician's desire to represent the traditional in
          the most attractive light. The Romanticism of superstition finds its poet in Coleridge,
          whose studied childishness and simplicity are near of kin to Tieck's; and it is Coleridge,
          too, who, thoroughly imbued with the doctrines of the German philosophy of the day, enters
          a general scientific protest against those of the age of enlightenment. His philosophy is
          quite un-English; it is, in contradiction to the experimental nature of English science,
          purely transcendental; it is conservative, pious, and historical, because the philosophy
          preceding it had been radical, infidel, and metaphysical; it is a »Schellingism,« which at
          first endeavours to preserve as many of the philosophic conclusions of the preceding
          century as possible, but which, ever more obstinate and ever more narrow-minded, hastens
          towards the opposite extreme from that which had proved fatal to the preceding period. The <pb n="5"/> confusedly fantastic side of Romanticism is represented by Southey with his Oriental
          narrative poems; and as for the passionate, despairing heroes of Chateaubriand and
          Romanticism generally, we find them, more passionate and more manly, in the works of
          Byron; whilst Shelley's spiritualism and dissolution of all solid form into ethereal music
          recalls the ardour and vagueness of Novalis.</p>

        <p>[1] This »oppression« was what today would be called »cultural imperialism«. It should be
          remembered that the Danish kings were also German dukes (of Schleswig and Holstein) and
          very properly patronised German artists. In Denmark proper there was after 1800 a reaction
          against the German influence. Also Brandes is bitter because of the German annexation of
          the Danish part of Schleswig in 1864, but that happened half a century later and Denmark
          was not exactly an innocent victim.–Transcriber's note.</p> -->

        <head type="add">2. National Characteristics</head>
        <head><pb n="[6]"/> II. NATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS</head>

        <p>But these general and most marked characteristics of the period are modified in a very
          perceptible manner by certain peculiarly English characteristics, which, observable
          nowhere else, are to be found in all the English authors of the day, however little
          resemblance there may be between them in other respects.</p>

        <p>These English characteristics can all be traced back to one original distinctive quality,
          namely vigorous <emph>Naturalism</emph>. As we have observed, the first advance in the new literary
          movement is the inspiration of the authors of every country by a national spirit. Now in
          England this meant becoming a Naturalist, just as in Germany it meant becoming a
          Romanticist, and in Denmark a devotee of the Old-Scandinavian. The English poets, one and
          all, are observers, lovers, worshippers of nature. Wordsworth, who loves to parade his
          propensities as ideas, inscribes the word <emph>nature</emph> on his banner, and paints pictures,
          grand in spite of their minute detail, of the hills, the lakes, the rivers, and the rustic
          population of the North of England. Scott's descriptions of nature, based upon close
          observation, are so accurate that a botanist might acquire a correct idea of the
          vegetation of the district from them. Keats, with all his devotion to the antique and to
          Greek mythology, is a sensualist, who, gifted with the keenest, widest, most delicate
          perceptions, sees, hears, feels, tastes, and inhales all the varieties of glorious colour,
          of song, of silky texture, of fruit flavour, of flower fragrance, which nature offers.
          Moore is the personification of spiritualised sensuality; the pampered, pampering poet, he
          seems to live surrounded by all that is rarest and most beautiful in nature; he dazzles <pb n="7"/> our minds with sunshine, deafens them with the song of the nightingale, drowns them in
          sweetness; we live with him in endless dreams of wings, flowers, rainbows, smiles,
          blushes, tears, kisses–always kisses. The strongest tendency even of works like Byron's
          <emph>Don Juan</emph> and Shelley's <emph>Cenci</emph> is in reality Naturalism. In other words, Naturalism is
          so powerful in England that it permeates Coleridge's Romantic supernaturalism,
          Wordsworth's Anglican orthodoxy, Shelley's atheistic spiritualism, Byron's revolutionary
          liberalism, and Scott's interest in the past. It influences the personal beliefs and the
          literary tendencies of every author.</p>

        <p>This realism, so full of sap and vigour, is a result of various strongly-marked and
          almost universal English characteristics. There is, in the first place, the English love
          of the country and of the sea. Almost all the English poets of this period are either
          countrymen or seamen. The English Muse of poetry has from time immemorial frequented the
          country seat and the farm. Wordsworth's genuinely English poetry is in exact keeping with
          the well-known paintings and engravings representing English country life, which produce
          an impression of health and tranquillity, and, when such subjects as family worship or the
          country clergyman's fatherly ministrations are portrayed, also of piety. Burns, the
          ploughman poet, Scotland's greatest poetic genius, early dedicated Scottish poetry to the
          country; and there is truth in Emerson's caustic remark that Scott, in his narrative
          poems, simply wrote a rhymed guide-book to Scotland. That the same idea had occurred to
          the poet's own contemporaries is evident from the satirical manner in which Moore writes
          of Scott's »doing« the one country-seat after the other.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">

        <p><pb n="8"/> And what an important part country seats play in the lives of two such antipodal literary
          characters as Byron and Scott! Newstead Abbey is as inseparably connected with Byron's
          name as Abbotsford is with Sir Walter Scott's. The old abbey, with its medieval and
          fantastic architecture, is to Byron the indispensable accompaniment of his peerage and the
          pledge of his English citizenship. He does not dispose of it until he has turned his back
          on his native land for ever. Scott's proprietorship is not so ancient and venerable; but
          he buys Abbotsford when the desire to own land, which has always been strong in him,
          becomes irresistible, and, during the happy period of his life passed there, lives as if
          he had grown up with no other prospect before him than that of exercising the regal
          hospitality of an old Scottish landed proprietor and living his hardy out-of-door life.
          His greatest delight is in such perilous amusements as wading through a raging
          stream–with a bridge not fifty yards off, riding a horse unmanageable by any one else,
          spearing salmon by torch-light, soaked with rain or shivering in the cold night air. And
          is not every reader of Byron's life here reminded of that poet's love of wild rides and
          daring swimming exploits?</p>

        <p>Nevertheless there is in the attitude of the two authors to their estates a difference,
          characteristic of their different natures. Byron's love for Newstead Abbey had its origin
          in his aristocratic proclivities, Scott's for Abbotsford in his historic instincts. Just
          as Sir Walter's estate had Ettrick Forest for its background, Newstead had Sherwood
          Forest, with its memories of Robin Hood and his merry men. But these memories exercised no
          perceptible influence on Byron's poetry, though we have an admirable description of the
          Abbey itself in the Thirteenth Canto of <emph>Don Juan</emph>. The whole of Scott's poetry, on the
          contrary, is pervaded, as by a refrain, by the memories of Ettrick Forest; and it is
          Scott, instead of Byron, who (in <emph>Ivanhoe</emph>) brings the poetry of Sherwood Forest to life
          again.</p>

        <p>Another English qualification for Naturalism is the love of the poets for the nobler
          animals, and their intimacy with the animal world in general. They have that affection for <pb n="9"/> all domestic animals which is a result of their English love of home. When they travel
          they carry home and their domestic animals with them. Almost all the authors of our period
          are devoted to manly exercises, and in particular to riding. And in observing this we must
          not fall into the common error of mistaking a thoroughly national characteristic for a
          personal and rare one. It is not without its significance that the English race traces its
          descent from two mystic heroes bearing the names of horses (Hengist and Horsa). The love
          of horses, dogs, and all kinds of wild animals, which is so often mentioned as a peculiar
          characteristic of Byron, the misanthropical exile, is quite as marked a characteristic of
          Scott, living at home in the happiest domestic circumstances. Matthew's well-known letter
          describing the life at Newstead Abbey shows us Byron, the youth, surrounded by a whole
          menagerie, including a bear and a wolf; in Medwin's account of the poet's life in Italy we
          read that he took with him when he left Ravenna in 1821, »seven servants, five carriages,
          nine horses, a monkey, a retriever, a bull-dog, two cats, three Guinea fowls, and other
          birds.« One is apt to think this an exhibition of purely personal singularity, until one
          reads, in Lockhart's Life, Scott's own description of the removal to Abbotsford. »The
          neighbours have been much delighted with the procession of my furniture, in which old
          swords, bows, targets, and lances made a very conspicuous show. A family of turkeys was
          accommodated within the helmet of some <emph>preux</emph> chevalier of ancient Border fame; and the
          very cows, for aught I know, were bearing banners and muskets. I assure your ladyship that
          this caravan, attended by a dozen of ragged rosy peasant children, carrying fishing-rods
          and spears, and leading poneys, greyhounds, and spaniels, would, as it crossed the Tweed,
          have furnished no bad subject for the pencil.« The only difference is that the old
          curiosity shop of the collector is added to the menagerie. Byron's love for his dog,
          Boatswain, and the solemn inscription engraved on the stone marking the favourite's grave,
          are apt to be instanced as signs of the poet's rooted melancholy. But it helps us to a
          more <pb n="10"/> correct appreciation of such feelings to remember that the cheerful-minded Scott had
          his favourite dog, Camp, solemnly buried in the garden at Abbotsford, the whole family
          standing weeping round the grave.</p>

        <p>But even more characteristically English than the attachment to horses and dogs and land,
          and the witness in literature to the same, is the love of the sea. The Englishman is an
          amphibious animal. A considerable part of the description of nature in the literature of
          this period is marine painting. It was an ancient tradition, gloriously maintained at this
          particular time, that England was the mistress of the sea; and English writers have always
          been the best delineators and interpreters of the sea. There is a breath of its freshness
          and freedom in all the best poetry of the country. To the Englishman the sea has always
          been the great symbol of liberty, as the Alps have been to the freedom-loving Swiss.
          Wordsworth exclaims with truth in one of his <emph>Sonnets Dedicated to Liberty</emph>:–</p>


        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Two Voices are there; one is of the Sea,</l>
          <l>One of the Mountains; each a mighty voice:</l>
          <l>In both from age to age thou didst rejoice,</l>
          <l>They were thy chosen music, Liberty!«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>


        <p>We understand, therefore, how it was that the long-dormant Viking spirit re-awoke in the
          best poets of the country during this remarkable period of English literature. In
          Coleridge's <emph>Ancient Mariner</emph> we have all the terror and horror of the sea; Campbell's
          <emph>Mariners of England</emph> is an entrancingly melodious and manly glorification of the heroism
          and might of the English seamen; Byron's Vikinglike expeditions are mirrored in the
          exploits of Childe Harold and Don Juan; Shelley's passion for the sea and sailing lives
          and breathes in the billowy rhythm of his verse and in all the poems which extol wind and
          wave–above all others that masterpiece, the <emph>Ode to the West Wind</emph>.</p>

        <p>Transferred to the domain of society, Naturalism becomes, as it did in Rousseau's case,
          revolutionary; and beneath that attachment to the soil, and that delight in encountering
          and mastering the fitful humours of the sea, <pb n="11"/> which are the deep-seated causes of
          Naturalism, there is in the Englishman the still deeper-seated national feeling, which,
          under the peculiar historical conditions of this period, naturally led the cleverest men
          of the day in the direction of Radicalism. No nation is so thoroughly penetrated by the
          feeling of personal independence as England. This is best seen in the Englishman abroad;
          it is with a flourish of trumpets that he proclaims himself to be an Englishman. It is the
          transmission of this independence and self-sufficiency to English literature which has at
          decisive moments made its art a »character-art«; and at the period under consideration it
          is this peculiar quality which, asserting itself, actually produces the new movement in
          the literature of Europe. It took an Englishman to do what Byron did, stem alone the
          stream which flowed from the fountain of the Holy Alliance–in the first place, because
          only an English author would have had the audacity to do it, in the second, because at
          that time only English literary men had the strong political tendency and the keen
          political intelligence which have always distinguished the first, possibly the only,
          parliamentary nation. And an Englishman, too, was needed to fling the gauntlet boldly and
          defiantly in the face of his own people. Only in the haughtiest of nations were there to
          be found great men haughty enough to defy the nation.</p>

        <p>This personal independence which distinguishes the country's most eminent authors is the
          outcome of a genuinely English peculiarity. These men are the followers of no particular
          doctrines; they rarely profess any artistic principles, and certainly never any
          philosophical creed. The great German authors, Lessing, Goethe, Schiller, all do most
          important services to science; but amongst the Englishmen there is not a single scientist.
          And a still more remarkable fact is that they never even consult one another. Goethe and
          Schiller carry on an interminable correspondence on the subject of the nature and proper
          treatment of the different varieties of poetic themes; they even sometimes discuss at
          great length the propriety of the addition or suppression of a single stanza. Heiberg, the
          Dane, and his school follow certain definite artistic principles which they have <pb n="12"/> agreed to
          observe, and are almost as critical as they are productive. But Scott and Byron and Moore,
          in spite of the cordial friendship subsisting between them, are perfectly isolated as
          regards authorship; each produces his works without receiving or desiring any suggestion
          or advice whatever from his brother authors. Even in the very exceptional case when one is
          influenced by another–as Byron, for instance, occasionally is by Wordsworth, and still
          more perceptibly by Shelley–the thing happens, as it were, secretly, quite insensibly, so
          that it is not alluded to, or at any rate not acknowledged as influence by the recipient.
          An American author has aptly described this characteristic of the race in the words: »Each
          of these islanders is himself an island.«</p>

        <p>We have already spoken of intelligent interest in politics. Just as there is not one
          among these authors who is a scientist, so there is hardly one among them who is not a
          politician. This interest in politics is a direct product of the national practicality.
          The opinions held by the different authors may be very dissimilar, but they are all party
          men; Scott is a Tory, Wordsworth a Monarchist, Southey and Coleridge are first supporters,
          then antagonists, of the democratic ideas of the day; Moore is on the side of the
          Irishmen; Landor, Campbell, Byron, and Shelley, as Radicals, side with all the oppressed
          nations. In excepting such an author as Keats, who may almost be said to have been devoted
          to art for art's sake, we must not forget that he died at the age of twenty-five.</p>

        <p>The intense interest taken in practical matters explains why purely literary questions
          (such as that of the respective merits of Classicism and Romanticism), in their utter
          disconnectedness with life, never became of such exaggerated importance in English as they
          did at this period in German, Danish, and even French literature. It is, however, amusing
          to observe how our authors combine the Englishman's impulse towards practical action with
          the fantastic proclivities of the poet. Scott carried his antagonism to the Revolution to
          a perfectly Quixotic length. He arranged with one of his friends, a duke, that, if the
          French landed in England, they two would take to the woods and live the life of Robin Hood
          and his followers. And it was about the same time that <pb n="13"/> Southey and Coleridge, in the first
          Jacobinical ardour of their youth, informed their acquaintances that it was their
          intention to emigrate to a scantily populated part of America; the banks of the
          Susquehanna were chosen because the name of this river struck the young men as being
          peculiarly <emph>beautiful and melodious</emph>; they proposed to found a community there, a
          pantisocrasy, with community of goods and equality of all the members under natural
          conditions. Landor, who, as a soldier in Spain, proved that he was prepared to risk his
          life for his opinions, as a youth cherished the idea of reviving, at home in Warwickshire,
          the Arcadian idyllic age; he is the literary counterpart of Owen, the Socialist. Shelley,
          as politician, showed such keenness of perception that, studying him as such, we are
          constantly reminded of the characterisation in <emph>Julian and Maddalo</emph>:</p>

        
        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»<emph>Me</emph>, who am as a nerve o'er which do creep</l>
          <l>The else unfelt oppressions of this earth.«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>


        <p>He foresaw many a political revolution that actually came to pass. But the same Shelley
          who, half a century before the passing of the Reform Bill of 1867, published an accurate
          draft of it in a political pamphlet, and who in his drama, <emph>Hellas</emph>, prophesied the
          success of the revolt of the Greeks at a time when their cause seemed hopeless, is an
          utter fantast as soon as he begins to enlarge on the coming Golden Age of humanity. Read
          his description of it in a youthful work, <emph>Queen Mab</emph>. The Polar icebergs melt, the
          deserts are cultivated, the basilisk licks the infant's feet, the hurricane blasts become
          melodious, the fruits of the earth are always ripe and its flowers always in bloom, no
          animal is killed and eaten by man, the birds no longer fly from him, fear no longer
          exists. We cannot but be reminded of some of the wildest dreams of the French Socialists
          of the same period. The spread of the <emph>Phalansteries</emph> devised by Fourier was expected to
          bring about such a change in the whole economy of the world that at last even natural
          conditions would be entirely altered; an immense aurora borealis, perpetually suspended
          above the North Pole, would make Siberia as warm as Andalusia; man would deprive the <pb n="14"/> sea
          of its salt and give it in return a flavour of lemonade; and the monsters of the deep
          would allow themselves to be harnessed, like sea-horses, to our ships. The invention of
          the steam-engine fortunately rendered this species of traction superfluous. Even Byron,
          who is decidedly the most practical of these poets, is often the poet in his politics. It
          hardly admits of doubt that he had the crown of Greece before his eyes as the recompense
          of his exertions in the cause of that country.</p>

        <p>There was plenty of fantasticalness in practical matters in the English poets, too; but
          there undoubtedly is more practicality in their morality and their view of life than in
          those of the poets of other nations. There are a few more grains of sound sense in their
          works. They are, one and all, distinguished by a strong <emph>desire for justice</emph>. Wordsworth
          inherits it from Milton; Campbell, Byron, and Shelley feel it intuitively, and are ready
          in the strength of the feeling to defy the world. It plays no part, this feeling, in the
          life of Byron's great German predecessor, Goethe, or of his richly gifted French
          successor, De Musset. Neither of these ever summoned monarchs and governments before the
          tribunal of justice. But what is peculiarly English is, that this justice of which the
          Englishmen dream is not, like that which Schiller, for instance, worships, a cherished,
          preconceived idea, but a child of utility. To prove this let us take a poet as ethereally
          idealistic as Shelley, and we shall see that even his morality is as distinctly
          utilitarian as Bentham's and John Stuart Mill's. Here is a striking passage taken from the
          second chapter of his <emph>Speculations on Morals</emph>:–»If a man persists to inquire <emph>why</emph> he
          ought to promote the happiness of mankind, he demands a mathematical or metaphysical
          reason for a moral action. The absurdity of this scepticism is less apparent, but not less
          real than the exacting a moral reason for a mathematical or physical fact.« In the maxim,
          »the greatest happiness of the greatest number,« and in the profound, practical desire for
          justice, which is its psychological basis, we have the real point of departure of the
          Radicalism of English poetry during the period of the great European reaction.</p>

      <head type="add">3. The Political Background</head>
        <head><pb n="[15]"/> III. THE POLITICAL BACKGROUND</head>
        
        <p>The English being at once the most persevering and the most enterprising people, the
          nation which is most attached to home and fondest of travel, the slowest to make changes
          and yet, in matters political, the most broad-minded, the thinking men of the country
          naturally fall into two great political groups, the one representing the jealously
          conservative, the other the daringly liberal tendency. The English parties have no
          resemblance to the French. It may be exaggeration to say, with Taine, that France has only
          two parties–the party of the men of twenty and the party of the men of forty; yet this
          division is perhaps the essential one, which the other acknowledged party names merely
          modify. The English division is determined by the national character; and in the stirring
          literary period under consideration, Wordsworth is the representative of the one set of
          qualities, Byron the type of the other.</p>

        <p>In the first years of the century there was another source of political division in the
          dual nature of the chief event of the period. This great event was the war with France. Of
          the German War of Liberation I have already remarked that it was certainly revolt against
          a terrible despotism, but a despotism which was an expression of the ideas of the
          Revolution; that it was a fight for hearth and home, but undertaken at the command of the
          old reactionary reigning houses. And if such a remark is applicable to Germany's struggle,
          how much more applicable is it to the war waged by England. The independence of England
          was not assailed, but its interests were seriously threatened; and during the lengthy war,
          and for long afterwards, there were not, as in Germany, liberty-loving men at the head of
          affairs, but all power was <pb n="16"/> given into the hands of the most determinedly reactionary Tory
          government that the country had ever known.</p>

        <p>Hence it is that the background of this whole period of literature is so dark. The clouds
          which form it are heavy and black, »sunbeam-proof« Shelley would have called them. England
          itself, as the background of the panorama which I am about to unroll, is like a night
          landscape. The <emph>great</emph> qualities of the nation were misguided; its extraordinary
          resoluteness was applied to the suppression of another nation's desires for liberty; its
          own noble love of liberty was first utilised to overthrow the despotism of Napoleon and
          then misapplied in re-erecting all the old mouldering thrones which, under cover of the
          gunpowder smoke of Waterloo, were run up in as great haste as scaffolds are. The <emph>neutral</emph>
          qualities of the nation were educated into bad ones. Self-esteem and firmness were nursed
          into that hard-heartedness of the aristocratic, and that selfishness of the commercial
          classes which always distinguish a period of reaction; loyalty was excited into servility,
          and patriotism into the hatred of other nations which is apt to develop during long wars.
          And the national <emph>bad</emph> qualities were over-developed. The desire for outward decorum at
          any price, which is the shady side of the moral impulse, was developed into hypocrisy in
          the domain of morality; and that determined adherence to the established religion which is
          the least attractive outcome of a practical and not profoundly reasoning turn of mind, was
          fanned either into hypocrisy or active intolerance. No period was ever more favourable to
          the development of hypocrisy and fanaticism than this, during which the nation was
          actually encouraged by its leaders to boast of its religious superiority to free-thinking
          France.</p>

        <p>Those who suffered most were the country's greatest authors. It is out of fashion now to
          talk of the cant which drove Byron from his home; and many scrupulous critics are disposed
          to give the name of honest, if narrow-minded, conviction to what used to be frankly called
          hypocrisy. But this view of the matter is untenable. A piety which behaves as English
          piety did to Byron and Shelley is not mere stupidity, but narrow-minded, repulsive
          hypocrisy. <pb n="17"/> The dicta upon this subject of the keen American observer, Ralph Waldo Emerson,
          are of value; for as America's most eminent critic, as England's greatest admirer, and as
          judge of his own race, he has every claim to credence. He says:–»The torpidity on the
          side of religion of the vigorous English understanding shows how much wit and folly can
          agree in one brain. Their religion is a quotation, their church is a doll, and any
          examination is interdicted with screams of terror. In good company, you expect them to
          laugh at the fanaticism of the vulgar; but they do not; they are the vulgar.... The
          English, abhorring change in all things, abhorring it most in matters of religion, cling
          to the last rag of form, and are dreadfully given to cant. The English (and I wish it were
          confined to them, but 'tis a taint in the Anglo-Saxon blood in both hemispheres), the
          English and the Americans cant beyond all other nations. The French relinquish all that
          industry to them. What is so odious as the polite bows to God in our books and newspapers?
          The popular press is flagitious in the exact measure of its sanctimony, and the religion
          of the day is a theatrical Sinai, where the thunders are supplied by the property-man....
          The Church at this moment is much to be pitied. She has nothing left but possession. If a
          bishop meets an intelligent gentleman and reads fatal interrogations in his eyes, he has
          no resource but to take wine with him.«<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Emerson: <emph>English Traits</emph>, chap. xiii.</note> This description is of the England of 1830, so
          we can imagine what the condition of matters must have been twenty years earlier.</p>

        <p>The most lamentable national failing, the inclination to oppression, was positively
          reduced to a system, and was more conspicuous during this period of the country's history
          than any other. England, Scotland, and Ireland combine to oppress the distant colonies;
          England and Scotland, making common cause, oppress Ireland–keep down the Irish Church and
          repress Irish industry and commerce; England does what she can to repress Scotland; and in
          England itself the rich man oppresses the poor man, and the ruling class all the others.
          Of the <pb n="18"/> thirty million inhabitants of the country only one million possessed the franchise.
          And any one who cares to read the attack on the English landed proprietors in Byron's <emph>Age
          of Bronze</emph> will see how shamelessly the landowners enriched themselves at the expense of
          the other classes during the war, and how their whole political aim was to insure the
          continuance of their power to do so.</p>

        <p>Such are the conditions which exercise a partly pernicious, partly inspiring and
          stimulating influence on the country's authors. In those of them in whose breasts the
          sacred fire burns feebly it is soon extinguished, and they become reactionary supporters
          of the existing conditions. But those of them whose lightning-charged spirits were fitted
          to defy the direction of the wind, develop under the oppression of these conditions an
          emancipatory literary force which communicates a shock to the political atmosphere. To
          these latter England seems a very »Gibraltar of custom« and they leave their native land
          that they may attack and bombard their home with all the artillery of satire and
          indignation.</p>

        <p>In order to arrive at a proper understanding of the soil from which the Naturalistic
          literature springs, and to understand the principles (not artistic, but political, social,
          and religious principles) which divide the authors into antagonistic groups, we must enter
          a little more into detail with regard to the political conditions prevailing in this home.
          At the beginning of the century there sat on the throne of England the king who had
          reigned since 1760, George the Third. From his earliest childhood George's mother had
          endeavoured to inoculate him with the exaggerated and un-English notions of sovereignty
          which prevailed on the Continent, and she had succeeded so well that one after another of
          the eminent noblemen who were chosen to be governors to the Prince resigned the office
          because their influence was counteracted. One of these, Lord Waldegrave, who was not
          merely a shrewd observer, but also a devoted adherent of the House of Hanover, has drawn a
          portrait of his royal pupil which is anything but attractive. He is described as not
          altogether deficient in ability, but wholly <pb n="19"/> without power of application; as honest, but
          without the frank and open behaviour which makes honesty amiable; as sincerely pious, but
          rather too attentive to the sins of his neighbours; resolute, but obstinate and strong in
          prejudices. The tutor tells how, when his pupil is displeased, his anger does not break
          out with heat and violence, but produces a fit of sullenness and silence. And, »when the
          fit is ended, unfavourable symptoms very frequently return, which indicate on certain
          occasions that his Royal Highness has too correct a memory.« And this same King, who had
          such a lively recollection of injuries, had a more than royal forgetfulness of services.
          But perhaps his greatest fault as a public personage and a ruler was his absolute
          petrifaction in prejudices. In private life he was honest, respectable, and reliable, and
          inspired his subjects with great esteem, though the defects in his education were never
          supplied. When he began to reign he had little or no knowledge of either books or men, and
          to the end of his life he remained perfectly ignorant as regarded literature and art. But
          in his selfish court he was not long in acquiring a considerable knowledge of human
          nature; the man to whom all, great and small, held out their hands whenever they saw him,
          soon learned to ascertain every man's price and to calculate his value. His naturally
          sound understanding was enlarged neither by study, nor travel, nor conversation; but on
          matters the discussion of which does not require much cultivation of mind he generally
          went to the point, and acquitted himself with as much ability as was necessary in a ruler
          who was very unwilling to be a king only in name.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Massey: <emph>History of England</emph>, i 59, &amp;c.</note></p>

        <p>George III. was England's Frederick VI. He was a true patriarchal ruler, who felt himself
          to be the father of his people. During his reign England lost the North American colonies,
          as Denmark under Frederick VI. lost Norway, without this loss, or the foolish policy which
          had led to it, damaging the personal popularity of the sovereign. King George's household
          was a model of an English gentleman's household. Early rising was its first rule.
          Simplicity, order, frugality, a real bourgeois spirit, reigned. It was <pb n="20"/> stupid to a degree
          which its historian Thackeray »shuddered to contemplate.«</p>

        <p>Often, we are told, the King rose before any one else was up, ran upstairs and awoke all
          the equerries, and then went for an early walk, and had a talk with every one he met. He
          was in the habit of poking his nose into every cottage; now he would give a child a silver
          coin, now present an old woman with a hen. One day, when the King and Queen were walking
          together, they met a little boy and talked to him. At last the King said, »This is the
          Queen; kneel down, and kiss her hand.« But this the little fellow obstinately declined to
          do, out of consideration for his new breeches; and the thrifty King was so delighted with
          such a sign of youthful prudence that he pressed the child to his heart.</p>

        <p>The days passed at this court with a dreary monotony which drove the young princes from
          home, and was in part responsible for their turning out so badly. In the evening the King
          either played his game of backgammon or had his evening concert, during which he always
          nodded, while the gentlemen-in-waiting almost yawned themselves to death in the
          ante-room.</p>

        <p>The family took their daily walk in Windsor Park; the people crowded round quite
          familiarly, and the Eton boys thrust their chubby cheeks under the crowd's elbows. The
          open-air music over, the King never failed to take his cocked hat off and salute his band,
          and say, »Thank you, gentlemen.«</p>

        <p>What Dane can fail to be reminded by these scenes of Frederick VI.'s walks and sails as
          Chief Admiral in the grounds of Frederiksberg! Like our Danish monarch, George III. won
          the affections of the people by the simplicity of his habits and his shabby coat. Equally
          applicable to King George is Orla Lehmann's remark about Frederick VI., »that his
          simplicity, both of mind and behaviour, and his kindly interest in the well-being of
          individuals were regarded as compensations for his failings as a statesman and ruler.« But
          indeed there were not many who detected these last. To the great majority of his subjects
          old George seemed a very wise statesman and very powerful sovereign. <pb n="21"/> There is a famous
          print of him (by Gillray) which represents him–in the old wig, in the stout old hideous
          Windsor uniform–as the King of Brobdingnag, peering at a little Gulliver, whom he holds
          up in one hand, whilst in the other he has an opera-glass, through which he surveys the
          pigmy. And who, think you, is the little Gulliver? He wears a cocked-hat and the little
          grey Marengo coat.</p>

        <p>Danish readers will remember an old picture, a photographic reproduction of which was
          very popular some years ago. It was called »The Well-beloved Family,« and represented
          Frederick VI. taking a walk with his whole family, from eldest to youngest. Is not the
          following picture (from the pages of Miss Burney) of one of the afternoon walks at Windsor
          its exact counterpart? »It was really a mighty pretty procession. The little Princess
          Amelia, just turned of three years old, in a robe-coat covered with fine muslin, a dressed
          close cap, white gloves, and fan, walked on alone and first, highly delighted with the
          parade, and turning from side to side to see everybody as she passed; for all the
          terracers stand up against the walls, to make a clear passage for the royal family the
          moment they come in sight. Then followed the King and Queen, no less delighted with the
          joy of their little darling. The Princess Royal leaning on Lady Elizabeth Waldegrave, the
          Princess Augusta holding by the Duchess of Ancaster, the Princess Elizabeth led by Lady
          Charlotte Bertie, followed. General Bude and the Duke of Montague, and Major Price as
          equerry, brought up the rear of the procession.« What a charming picture! exclaims
          Thackeray. Whilst the procession passes, the band plays its old music, the sun lights up
          the ancient battlements, the rich elms, the royal standard drooping from the great tower,
          and the loyal crowd, whom the charming infant caresses with her innocent smiles.</p>

        <p>This is the domestic idyll which in public life has its counterpart in the King's
          passionate determination to oppress North America, oppose the French Revolution,
          annihilate the Irish Church, and maintain negro slavery with all its horrors. But the
          idyllic family life was at an end before the century was out. In 1788 the King had his
          first attack <pb n="22"/> of insanity, and even then the question of the Regency of the Prince of
          Wales, which was not finally determined until 1810, was discussed with an extraordinary
          display of passion. The Opposition believed that if they could procure the appointment of
          the Prince of Wales as Regent, they would be able to keep the Tories out of power for a
          lengthy period. But the character and morals of the Prince were so repugnant to the great
          majority of the nation that his accession to power was regarded with dread. However,
          before the Regency Bill was actually proceeded with, Pitt was in a position to lay before
          Parliament a medical bulletin informing his subjects of the probable speedy and complete
          restoration of their King's health. The Prince's disappointment was great, and his having
          displayed anything but proper filial feeling during the King's illness made it difficult
          for him to disguise it. He had a talent for mimicry, and had amused the witty and
          profligate men and women who were his constant companions by <emph>taking off</emph>, as the saying
          was, the gestures and actions of his insane father. This alone is sufficient to show his
          character–the character of the man who, on account of a certain outward polish, went by
          the name of »the first gentleman in Europe.«</p>

        <p>Even though he retained it only for a short time, one cannot but admire the cleverness
          with which this Prince managed to win the friendship of many of the most gifted men of the
          day. Burke and Fox and Sheridan were his associates. Certainly, as Thackeray says, it was
          not his opinions about the constitution, or about the condition of Ireland, which they
          cared to hear–<emph>that</emph> man's opinions, indeed! But he talked with Sheridan of dice, and
          with Fox of wine; those were interests which the fool and the geniuses had in common; and
          Beau Brummell's friend and rival was an authority among the fashionable men of the day on
          such questions as the suitable button for a waistcoat and the best sauce for a partridge.
          He even attached Moore to himself for a short time. From the tone of a letter which Moore
          writes to his mother in June 1811 (<emph>Memoirs</emph>, i. 225), we understand plainly that he feels
          flattered by the Prince Regent's »cordial familiarity.« And the same is true for <pb n="23"/> a moment
          of Byron; his letter of reconciliation to Sir Walter Scott shows how susceptible he was to
          the Regent's flatteries on the subject of <emph>Childe Harold</emph>. And Scott himself! Good,
          honourable gentleman though he was, in his capacity of obstinate Tory he was always the
          Regent's faithful liegeman. And when the latter, as King George the Fourth, came to
          Scotland (where he figured in the dress of a Highland chief, with his fat legs bared and a
          kilt round his enormous body, as satirically described by Byron at the end of <emph>The Age of
          Bronze</emph>), Scott went on board the royal yacht to welcome him, seized a glass from which
          his Majesty had just drunk, begged to be allowed to keep it, vowed that it should remain
          for ever as an heirloom in his family, clapped it in his pocket, and, finding an
          unexpected guest when he went home, sat down upon it, and was quickly and painfully
          reminded of the royal keepsake. Scott continued faithful to George IV. long after Moore
          had riddled him with the darts of his wit, and Byron lashed him with his savage epigrams,
          and after even Brummell, walking in Hyde Park, had looked at him through his eye-glass and
          asked the Prince's companion, »Who is <emph>your fat friend</emph>?«</p>

        <p>For the insinuating heir-apparent in time became extremely corpulent. The life he led,
          the perpetual feasting and drinking bouts, produced such a habit of body that at last he
          could not walk. When he was to drive out, a board was put out at the window, and down it
          he was slid into his carriage. While the starving weavers in Glasgow and Lancashire were
          crying aloud to Heaven, he was arranging magnificent festivities, and receiving the exiled
          Bourbon as Louis XVIII. »The child is father of the man,« says Wordsworth. George IV.
          signalised his entrance into society by a feat worthy of his future life. He invented a
          new shoe-buckle. It was an inch long and five inches broad. »It covered the whole instep,
          reaching down to the ground on either side of the foot.« At his first appearance at a
          court ball his coat was, we read, of pink silk, with white cuffs; his waistcoat, white
          silk, embroidered with various-coloured foil, and adorned with a profusion of French
          paste. His hat was ornamented with a profusion <pb n="24"/> of steel beads, five thousand in number,
          with a button and loop of the same metal, and cocked in a new military style.</p>

        <p>A military style, indeed! It exactly suited the head that wore it. This head was full, at
          the time its owner began housekeeping in his splendid new palace of Carlton House, of
          vague projects of encouraging literature, science, and the arts; and for a moment it
          seemed as if they were really to be carried out–when at the Prince Regent's table Sir
          Walter Scott, the best <emph>raconteur</emph> of his time, with loyal devotion and real generosity
          poured forth humorous, whimsical stories from his inexhaustible store, or Moore sang some
          of his sweet Anacreontic songs, or Grattan, Ireland's proud leader, contributed to the
          entertainment his wondrous eloquence, fancy, and feeling. But how soon did these men make
          way for a company much better suited to the Prince–French cooks, French ballet-dancers,
          horse-jockeys, buffoons, procurers, tailors, boxers, jewellers, and fencing-masters! With
          such people he spent the time left him by his mistresses and his bacchanalian orgies. He
          showed his love for art and his taste by purchasing at extravagant prices whole cart-loads
          of Chinese monstrosities. It was but natural that this royal <emph>bel esprit</emph>, when he came
          into power, should quarrel with the clever Whigs whose society he had sought. He suddenly
          wheeled round and became a Tory.</p>

        <p>Four of the European monarchs of the first half of this century–Ludwig I. of Bavaria,
          Frederick William IV. of Prussia, Christian VIII. of Denmark, and this English Prince
          Regent–bear a strong resemblance to each other. They are the four reigning reactionary
          dilettanti. In England, as in Denmark, literary dilettantism succeeds patriarchal
          simplicity. In the case we are at present considering, it was combined with shocking
          morals and an almost incredible indolence. In March 1816, fifty-eight prisoners under
          sentence of death were lying in Newgate prison waiting until the Prince Regent's
          amusements and distractions should allow him time to sign their death-warrants or their
          pardons, and many of them had lain there since December. In vain did Brougham make his
          terrible attack in Parliament upon those »who, when the gaols were <pb n="25"/> filled with wretches,
          could not suspend for a moment their thoughtless amusements to end the sad suspense
          between life and death.« In connection with this subject, Moore's satires in <emph>The Twopenny
          Post-Bag</emph> are well worth reading. They show plainly that the sweet Irish song-bird had
          beak and claws. In <emph>The Life of Sir Walter Scott</emph> we read with what a good-humoured smile
          the Regent, in 1815, could refer to and quote the verses by Moore which describe his table
          as loaded with fashion-journals on the one side and unsigned death-warrants on the other.
          The satire of the verses was only too well deserved, but was of little avail. As early as
          1812 Castlereagh had said, in a speech in Parliament: »It would be impossible for his
          Royal Highness to disengage his person from the accumulating pile of papers that encompass
          it.« In »The Insurrection of the Papers,« Moore puts it thus:–</p>

        
        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»On one side lay unread Petitions,</l>
          <l>On t'other hints from five Physicians;</l>
          <l><emph>Here</emph>tradesmen's bills,–official papers,</l>
          <l>Notes from my Lady, drams for vapours–</l>
          <l><emph>There</emph> plans of saddles, tea and toast,</l>
          <l>Death-warrants, and the <emph>Morning Post</emph>.«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>


        <p>Four years later, the Regent had actually allowed fifty-eight death-warrants to
          accumulate.</p>

        <p>As already mentioned, he was hardly invested with the signs of power before he quarrelled
          with his Whig friends and became a Tory. The great, long-lasting Tory Government was
          formed. At its head was the Earl of Liverpool, an obstinate, but lazy and good-natured
          reactionary; the displeasure of the public never fell upon him, but always on his
          colleagues; he was, as Prime Minister, a kind of monarch with limited power, honest
          intentions, and modest abilities. He and his colleague, Lord Sidmouth, the Home Secretary,
          enjoyed the privilege of not being envied and feared for the force of their characters or
          the splendour of their talents. The most notable and most fiercely criticised member of
          the ministry was Lord Castlereagh, a moderately gifted man of energetic character, whom
          Wilberforce once declared to be as cold-blooded as a fish. He <pb n="26"/> had a handsome face and a
          commanding voice, and to these added the outward show of honours which had not been
          bestowed on a commoner since the days of Sir Robert Walpole. He was »the noble lord in the
          blue ribbon.« He had a natural leaning towards arbitrary principles, and his intercourse
          with the irresponsible rulers of the continent tended to strengthen him in ideas which
          were extremely dangerous for a constitutional minister. No consciousness of the narrowness
          of his intellect and the defects of his education prevented him from pouring out torrents
          of unformed sentences and disjointed arguments. These often aroused the laughter of the
          House; but he withstood all attacks with unflinching determination; none of the hostility
          or suspicions expressed moved him a hair's-breadth from his path; in his intercourse with
          Parliament, he again and again adopted the standpoint of absolutism: »We alone know.«
          Byron, Shelley, and Moore all flagellate him in their poetry. There remains to be named
          Lord Chancellor Eldon, the personification of Toryism, whose thought by day and dream by
          night was the maintenance of what he called the constitution. In his opinion the man who
          attempted to do away with any ancient privilege, any antiquated restriction of the liberty
          of the subject, and still more the man who attempted to repeal any cruel penal law, was
          laying his hand on the constitution. Yet no one was more ready than he himself to suspend
          the laws of the country whenever they stood in his way. The suspension of the Habeas
          Corpus Act, the gagging of the press, &amp;c.–such amputations as these were life to the
          constitution; to infuse new blood was death.</p>

        <p>This was the ministry which, in 1814, astonished Alexander of Russia by its ardour in
          re-asserting and re-establishing the principles which had been shaken by the Revolution.
          He slighted it by expressing pity for its reactionary tendencies and cultivating the
          acquaintance of the leaders of the Opposition in London. The first tidings of the French
          Revolution had been received with approval by the English Government and nation. The
          antagonists Pitt and Fox united in hailing it as one of the greatest and most beneficent
          events <pb n="27"/> in the history of humanity. But hardly had blood been shed on the other side of the
          Channel, before the mass of the people, including even the majority of the Opposition, saw
          their whole national inheritance–monarchy, religion, the rights of property–endangered,
          and formed an enormous party of order. Amongst the Whigs, Burke was the first to condemn
          the Revolution violently, and as violently to condemn his friend and political ally, Fox,
          for defending its spirit. The old Whigs sided with Burke. Pitt, who had planned a whole
          series of necessary reforms, took alarm, dared not even make any alterations in the
          disgraceful election system, and, on being challenged, confessed that, though fully
          persuaded of the necessity of Parliamentary reform, the time was not a favourable one for
          such a daring attempt. Jacobinism was scented in every liberal movement, however innocent
          and justifiable. When Wilberforce began his agitation against the negro slave-trade, he
          was supported both by the Government and the Opposition. He had against him only the King,
          the shipowners, and the House of Peers. But when, in 1791, he tried the temper of the
          nation for the second time, the revulsion had been so great that the champions of the
          abolition of the slave-trade were almost regarded as Jacobins, and Wilberforce's bill was
          rejected by a majority of 163 to 88.</p>

        <p>The impression produced in Ireland by the Revolution was another cause of affright in
          England. The Irish hailed the tidings of the Revolution as slaves and serfs hail the news
          of emancipation. Although the Irish nation, under the leadership of the noble Henry
          Grattan (so enthusiastically eulogised by Byron), had succeeded in 1782 in obtaining the
          absolute independence and supremacy of its own Parliament, both the commerce and the
          religion of the country were still oppressed. Thomas Moore, a very moderate man, writes
          that, as the child of Catholic parents, he came into the world with the yoke of the slave
          round his neck. He tells how, when a boy, he was taken, in 1792, by his father to a public
          dinner in Dublin, at which one of the toasts was: »May the breezes of France blow our
          Irish oak into verdure!« In his <emph>Memoirs</emph> we have a description of <pb n="28"/> the movement amongst
          the youth of the country. He knew and admired its leader, Robert Emmet. When, in the
          Dublin Debating Society, of which he was the moving spirit and chief ornament, Emmet gave
          an eloquent description of the doings of the French Republic–when, with an allusion to
          the story of Cæsar swimming across the river with his sword in one hand and his
          <emph>Commentaries</emph> in the other, he said: »Thus France at this time swims through a sea of
          blood, but, while in one hand she wields the sword against her aggressors, with the other
          she upholds the interests of literature uncontaminated by the bloody tide through which
          she struggles«–his young countryman listened not only to the literal meaning of the
          speech, but for every little allusion or remark which he might apply to Ireland. And such
          allusions were forthcoming. »When a people,« cried Emmet one day, »advancing rapidly in
          civilisation and the knowledge of their rights, look back after a long lapse of time, and
          perceive how far the spirit of their Government has lagged behind them, what then, I ask,
          is to be done by them in such a case? What, but to pull the Government up to the
          people.«</p>

        <p>The day was not far off when Robert Emmet was to pay dearly for all his bold words. In
          1798 the long-prepared-for explosion took place; and, as Byron puts it, Castlereagh
          »dabbled his sleek young hands in Erin's gore.« The fury with which the Government set to
          work to crush the rebellion and the rebels was so animal and ferocious, that the horrors
          accompanying the proceeding are almost unequalled in the history of rebellion-suppressing
          in modern times.</p>

        <p>The hatred of the Revolution prolonged itself into hatred of Napoleon. This last went
          beyond all reasonable bounds. Thackeray tells an anecdote which gives an idea of its
          character. »I came,« he writes, »from India as a child, and our ship touched at an island
          on the way home, where my black servant took me a long walk over rocks and hills until we
          reached a garden, where we saw a man walking. 'That is he', said the black man: 'That is
          Bonaparte! He eats three sheep every day, and all the little children he can <pb n="29"/> lay hands
          on.'« And Thackeray adds: »There were people in the British dominions, besides that poor
          Calcutta servingman, with an equal horror of the Corsican ogre.« We have it strong in
          Wordsworth's sonnets, Southey's poems, and in Scott's notorious »Life of Napoleon.« The
          wars with France inaugurated the great British reaction–repeated suspension of the Habeas
          Corpus Act, extension of the definitions of treason contained in the old statutes of
          Edward III., encroachments on the right of public discussion and petition, and also on the
          virtual liberty of the press. In Scotland, more particularly, barbarous old statutes were
          revived, and highly cultured men were banished as common convicts to the Australian penal
          settlements. Those in power were not afraid, in addressing the English republicans and
          advocates of equality, to talk of the absolute power of the sovereign, and of the
          comparative insignificance of Parliament and the representatives of the people. An
          all-powerful party was formed, with the watchword: The King and the Church!</p>

        <p>The King himself was insane, the Prince Regent worse than insane, and the Church
          hypocritical. In 1812 came floods, a failure of the harvest, and famine. Starvation drove
          crowds of the poor classes from their homes, to wander aimlessly about the country.
          Expression is given to their mood in Shelley's <emph>Masque of Anarchy</emph>. The workmen of
          Nottingham, in their despair, broke into the lace-factories and destroyed the frames. It
          was in defence of these men that Byron made his well-turned maiden speech in
          Parliament.</p>

        <p>We see from Romilly's Journal how impossible it was for the few liberally inclined
          politicians to pass even the smallest measure of a reformatory nature. Romilly was
          universally revered as the reformer of the barbarous English penal code, but is best known
          nowadays as the legal adviser of the Princess of Wales and of Lady Byron. In 1808 he
          writes: »If any person be desirous of having an adequate idea of the mischievous effects
          which have been produced in this country by the French Revolution and all its attendant
          horrors, he should attempt some legislative <pb n="30"/> reform on humane and liberal principles. He
          will then find, not only what a stupid dread of innovation, but what a savage spirit it
          has infused into the minds of many of his countrymen.« When Romilly brought in a bill to
          repeal the Act of William III. which made death the punishment for shop-lifting, Lord
          Ellenborough, actively supported by Lord Eldon, opposed the bill, along with two others of
          a similar nature, declaring that »they went to alter those laws which a century had proved
          to be necessary, and which were now to be overturned by speculation and modern
          philosophy.« And it was not the Government alone which appeared to be, as it were,
          possessed by the lust of hanging; it was widely spread among the members of Parliament.
          Romilly tells how one of the young members answered all his arguments and objections with
          the one monotonous retort: »I am for hanging all.« And yet one would have imagined that in
          the nineteenth century the time had come to put an end to that partiality for hanging
          which in England still bore lamentable witness to the amount of savagery existing in the
          national character. In the reign of Henry VIII, 72,000 thieves were hanged, and under
          George III. they were still hanged by the dozen. In 1817, a regular system of suppression
          of free-thought and liberty of publication was evolved during the different prosecutions
          of the old bookseller, William Hone, who, with a rare combination of honesty and
          shrewdness, time after time defeated every attempt to convict him of blasphemy. In 1819
          occurred the Manchester riots, when a cavalry charge was ordered, and the poor unarmed
          rioters were maltreated by the soldiers. The impression produced by the events of the
          immediately preceding years is preserved in Shelley's poems of the year 1819.</p>

        <p>The political background of the intellectual life of this period is, thus, undoubtedly a
          dark one–dark with the terror produced in the middle classes by the excesses of the
          liberty movement in France, dark with the tyrannic lusts of proud Tories and the Church's
          oppressions, dark with the spilt blood of Irish Catholics and English artisans. And on the
          pinnacle of society the crown is set on the insanity in George the Third's head, and the
          sceptre is placed in the <pb n="31"/> hands of the careless lewdness which, in the person of the Prince
          Regent, occupies the throne as proxy for the narrow-mindedness which had occupied it in
          the person of his father. And it is this throne which Lord Eldon supports with the six
          »gagging bills« into which he has transformed England's ancient constitution–this throne
          which is lauded and glorified in Castlereagh's ungrammatical, anti-liberal speeches, and
          in Southey's unmelodious, highly-paid adulatory verse–until the horrible, incredible
          scandals of George IV.'s divorce suit, spreading like a great sewer from the tribunal of
          the Upper House, drown the glory of the throne and the dignity of the court in a flood of
          mire, and the revolutions of Spain, Greece, and South America, following on each other
          without intermission, clear the air, and Castlereagh cuts his throat (»slits a
          goose-quill,« as Byron says), and England, under Canning, recognises the South American
          republics, and paves the way for the battle of Navarino.</p>

        <p>The writings of Shelley, Landor, Byron, and Campbell, have political equivalents in
          Canning's actions as minister. Indeed, Canning's speeches complement these authors' works.
          Castlereagh's invertebrate speeches and his dull, meagre official letters (the more meagre
          because, as a good business man of the school of Metternich, he preferred verbal
          communications) were at once succeeded by Canning's frank and glowing eloquence.
          Castlereagh, like his surviving colleagues of the ignominious Congress of Vienna,
          endeavoured, under the guise of evangelic peace, to maintain silence and darkness in
          Europe; Canning's speeches shone through the dark night of the Holy Alliance like a forest
          conflagration. The great idea that inspired him was the belief in the right of a people to
          free action. He died on the 8th of August 1827; but on the 10th of October of the same
          year was fought the battle of Navarino, which was, as it were, the last will of the dead
          man, and which to our generation is the political symbol of the awakening of the new
          spirit in Europe.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Miss Martineau: <emph>The History of England during the Thirty Years' Peace</emph>, I., II.

        <head><pb n="[32]"/> IV. THE BEGINNINGS OF NATURALISM</head>

        <p>During the summer of 1797, the talk of the inhabitants of a village on the coast of
          Somersetshire ran much on the subject of two young men who had lately taken up their
          residence there, and were daily to be seen walking together, absorbed in eager, endless
          discussions, in which foreign words and foreign names, unintelligible to the natives, were
          of frequent occurrence. The elder of the two was twenty-seven. The expression of his face
          was profoundly serious, his manner dignified, almost solemn; he was not unlike a young
          Methodist parson, and had a monotonous and fatiguing voice. His companion, who was a year
          or two younger, and whose words, accompanied by much violent gesture, flowed in an
          unceasing stream, had a large round head (the shape of which indicated remarkable gifts),
          flatfish features, and deep hazel eyes, as full of confused depression as of inspiration.
          The whole figure and air might be called flabby and irresolute, expressive of weakness
          with a curious possibility of strength. The youth's voice was musical, and his eloquence
          seemed to entrance even his reserved auditor and friend. Who and what were these two young
          men, who desired acquaintance with no one in the place or neighbourhood? This was the
          question the inhabitants put to themselves. What could they be discussing so eagerly but
          politics? and if so, what could they be but conspirators, possibly Jacobins hatching
          treasonous plots?</p>

        <p>The rumour soon spread that the elder of the two friends, Mr. Wordsworth, had been in
          France at the beginning of the Revolution, and had amply shared the enthusiasm of the day
          for social reform; and that the younger, Mr. Coleridge, had distinguished himself as a
          keen democrat and Unitarian, had <pb n="33"/>written a drama called <emph>The Fall of Robespierre</emph>, and two
          political pamphlets entitled <emph>Conciones ad populum</emph>, and had even formed the plan of
          founding, with others holding the same opinions, a socialistic community in the backwoods
          of America. No further confirmation of the suspicions entertained was required. A kind
          neighbour communicated with the authorities in London, and a detective with a Bardolph
          nose promptly appeared on the scenes, and, himself unobserved, followed the two gentlemen
          closely. Seeing them with papers in their hands, he made no doubt that they were drawing
          maps of the neighbourhood. He occasionally addressed them, and he hid himself for hours at
          a time behind a sandbank at the seaside, which was their favourite seat. According to
          Coleridge's account of the affair, which is, however, not entirely to be relied on, he at
          first thought that the two conspirators were aware of their danger, for he often heard
          them talk of one Spy-nosy, which he was inclined to interpret as a reference to himself;
          but he was speedily convinced that it was the name of a man who had made a book and lived
          long ago. Their talk ran most upon books, and they were perpetually desiring each other to
          look at <emph>this</emph> and to listen to <emph>that</emph>; but he could not catch a word about politics, and
          ere long gave up the attempt and took himself off.</p>

        <p>There was, as a matter of fact, nothing alarming to discover. The two friends had long
          ago slept off their revolutionary intoxication, and even with the Spinoza about whom they
          talked so much they had only a second-hand acquaintance; they discussed him without
          understanding him, much less assimilating him. Coleridge had made acquaintance with
          Spinozism in the course of his study of Schilling's early works, and he now initiated his
          friend, who was unlearned in philosophy, into his newly-acquired wisdom. But the name of
          Spinoza was in these conversations merely the symbol of a mystic worship of nature; Jacob
          Böhme's was to be heard in peaceful conjunction with it. The matter under consideration
          was not science, but poetry; and if, during these long discussions, there was any mention
          of a revolution, it was a purely literary and artistic revolution, with respect to which
          the two friends, from very different <pb n="34"/> starting-points, had arrived at remarkably similar
          conclusions.</p>

        <p>What was really accomplished in the course of these conversations was nothing less than
          that <emph>conscious</emph> literary rupture with the spirit of the eighteenth century, which,
          assuming different forms in different countries, took place at this time all over
          Europe.</p>

        <p>Coleridge was of an inquiring nature. His antipathy to French Classical powder and paint
          dated from his schooldays, when a teacher of independent opinions had warned his
          intelligent pupil against harps, lutes, and lyres in his compositions, demanding pen and
          ink instead; had bid him beware of Muses, Pegasus, Parnassus, and Hippocrene in poetry,
          affirming everything of the sort to be nothing but rococo style and convention. Coleridge,
          therefore, refused the title of poet to Pope and his successors, and swore by Bowies'
          sonnets. He decried Pope in the same manner as Oehlenschläger's young friends in Denmark
          soon afterwards decried Baggesen. His Germanic temperament made him the born enemy of
          <emph>esprit</emph>, epigram, and points. It appeared to him that the excellence of the school which
          had its origin in France had nothing to do with poetry. »The excellence consisted in just
          and acute observations on men and manners in an artificial state of society, as its matter
          and substance; and in the logic of wit, conveyed in smooth and strong epigrammatic
          couplets, as its form. Even when the subject was purely fanciful the poet appealed to the
          intellect; nay, even in the case of a consecutive narration, a <emph>point</emph> was looked for at
          the end of each second line, and the whole was, as it were, a chain of epigrams.« In other
          words, the compositions of this school consisted, according to Coleridge, not of poetic
          thoughts, but of unpoetic thoughts translated into a language which was, by convention,
          called poetic. In the conception of the poem there was nothing fanciful; nay, so little
          imagination did the author possess, that »it depended on the compositor's putting or not
          putting <emph>a small capital</emph>, whether the words should be personifications or mere
          abstracts.« England's great poets, Spenser for example, had been able to express the most <pb n="35"/> fanciful ideas in the purest, simplest of English; but these newer writers could not
          express common, everyday thoughts except in such an extraordinarily bad and fantastic
          style that it seemed as if Echo and Sphinx had laid their heads together to produce it.
          Coleridge turned with aversion from these attempts to conceal want of imagination under
          affectation of style. He detested Odes to Jealousy, Hope, Forgetfulness, and all such
          abstractions. They reminded him of an Oxford poem on the subject of vaccination, which
          began: »Inoculation! heavenly maid, descend!« Even in the best English poetry of a later
          day the bad habit of personifying abstractions was too long adhered to. (Shelley, for
          example, presents us with »the twins Error and Truth.«) All these affectations appeared to
          Coleridge to arise from the custom of writing Latin verses in the public schools. The
          model style, according to him, was that which expressed natural thoughts in natural
          language, »neither bookish nor vulgar, neither redolent of the lamp nor of the kennel.«
          The old English ballads in Percy's collection, with their unadulterated natural, popular
          tone, seemed to him excellent guides. He, too, would fain write in such a tone.</p>

        <p>It was at this stage that Coleridge was initiated into all Wordsworth's ideas and
          projects. Wordsworth's was one of those natures which find satisfaction and a sense of
          security in dogmatic and strongly condemnatory verdicts. His idea of the whole of English
          poetry after Milton was, that the nation, after producing that great man, had lost the
          poetic power it, formerly possessed and had preserved only a form of composition, so that
          poetry had come to mean the art of diction–the poet being judged by the degree of mastery
          he had attained in that art. Hence there had been an ever more marked departure in
          metrical composition from the rules of prose. The poet's aim now must be to retrace the
          path that had been taken, and produce verse which should be distinguished only by its
          metrical form from the language of daily life. Whilst Coleridge was all for natural
          melody, Wordsworth went the length of demanding that poetry should be simply rhymed
          conversation.</p>

        <p>And with this naturalistic conception of form was com<pb n="36"/>bined a similar naturalistic
          conception of the subject matter of poetry. One of Wordsworth's favourite assertions and
          one of the most bitter reproaches he levelled at the prevailing literary taste was, that
          hardly one original image or new description of nature had been introduced into English
          verse in the age between Milton and Thomson. Himself endowed with an extraordinary
          receptivity for all the phenomena of external nature, he took the cry: »Nature! nature!«
          for his watchword–and by nature he meant the country as opposed to the town. In town life
          men forgot the earth on which they lived. They no longer really knew it; they remembered
          the general appearance of fields and woods, but not the details of the life of nature, not
          its varying play of smiling, sober, glorious, and terrible scenes. Who nowadays could tell
          the names of the various forest trees and meadow flowers? who knew the signs of the
          weather–what the clouds say when they hurry so, what those motions of the cattle mean,
          and why the mists roll down the hill? Wordsworth had known all these signs from the time
          when he played as a child among the Cumberland hills. He had a familiar acquaintance with
          all the varieties of English nature, at all seasons of the year; he was constituted to
          reproduce what he saw and felt, and to meditate profoundly over it before he reproduced
          it–was fitted to carry out, with full consciousness of what he was undertaking, the
          reformation of poetry which had been begun by poor Chatterton, »the sleepless soul,« and
          by the peasant Burns, a much more gifted poet than himself. Though he was but one of the
          numerous exponents of that love of nature which at the beginning of the century spread
          like a wave over Europe, he had a stronger, more profound consciousness than any man in
          the United Kingdom of the fact that a new poetic spirit was abroad in England.</p>

        <p>The friends agreed that there were three distinct periods of English poetry–the period
          of poetic youth and strength, from Chaucer to Dryden; the period of poetic barrenness,
          from (and including) Dryden to the end of the eighteenth century; and the period of
          regeneration, which was now beginning with themselves, after being heralded by their <pb n="37"/> predecessors. Like the men of the new era in Germany and Denmark, these young Englishmen
          sought for imposing terms to express the difference between themselves and those whom they
          attacked; and the terms they found were exactly the same as those adopted by their
          Continental contemporaries. They credited themselves with <emph>imagination</emph>–in other words,
          with the true creative gift, and wrote page upon page of vague eulogy of it as opposed to
          <emph>fancy</emph>; exactly as Oehlenschläger and his school eulogised imagination and allowed
          Baggesen at best only humour. They themselves were distinguished by <emph>reason</emph>, their
          predecessors had only had <emph>understanding</emph>; they had genius, their predecessors had only
          had talent; they were creators, their predecessors had only been critics. Even an
          Aristotle, not being a poet, could lay claim to no more than talent. In England, too,
          Noureddin<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">A character in the Danish poet Oehlenschläger's play, <emph>Aladdin</emph>, who represents
            talent as opposed to genius, which is embodied in Aladdin.</note> was belittled; the new men were conscious of the infinite superiority of
          their methods to his »un-natural« procedure.</p>

        <head><pb n="[38]"/> V. STRENGTH AND SINCERITY OF THE LOVE OF NATURE</head>

        <p>Wordworth's real point of departure, then, was the conviction that in town life and its
          distractions men had forgotten nature, and that they had been punished for it; constant
          social intercourse had dissipated their energy and talents and impaired the susceptibility
          of their hearts to simple and pure impressions. Amongst his hundreds of sonnets there is
          one which is peculiarly eloquent of this fundamental idea. It is the well-known:–</p>

        
        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»The World is too much with us; late and soon,</l>
          <l>Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers;</l>
          <l>Little we see in Nature that is ours;</l>
          <l>We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!</l>
          <l>This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon,</l>
          <l>The winds that will be howling at all hours</l>
          <l>And are up-gather'd now like sleeping flowers,</l>
          <l>For this, for everything we are out of tune;</l>
          <l>It moves us not.–Great God! I'd rather be</l>
          <l>A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn,–</l>
          <l>So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,</l>
          <l>Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;</l>
          <l>Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;</l>
          <l>Or hear old Triton blow his wreathèd horn.«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>


        <p>These are remarkable words to have come from Wordsworth's pen–remarkable, because they
          show what all sincere naturalism really is, let it be decked with as many theistic
          trappings as it will. In its inmost essence it is akin to the old Greek conception of
          nature, and antagonistic to all the official creeds of modern days; it is vitally
          impregnated with the pantheism which reappears in this century as the dominating element
          in the feeling for nature in every literature. <pb n="39"/> In a preceding volume of this work (<emph>The
          Romantic School in Germany</emph>) we made acquaintance with the pantheism which lay concealed
          under Tieck's Romantic view of nature. Now we come upon it in the form of the human
          being's self-forgetful and half unconscious amalgamation with nature, as a single tone in
          the great harmony of the universe. This idea has found expression in a curious little
          poem:–</p>


       <cit><quote><lg>
         <l>»A slumber did my spirit seal;</l>
         <l>I had no human fears:</l>
         <l>She seem'd a thing that could not feel</l>
         <l>The touch of earthly years.</l></lg>
         
         <lg>
           <l>No motion has she now, no force;</l>
           <l>She neither hears nor sees;</l>
           <l>Roll'd round in earth's diurnal course</l>
           <l>With rocks, and stones, and trees.«</l>
</lg>
       </quote></cit>
       
        
        <p>If we transport ourselves into the mood which gave birth to such a poem as this, we are
          conscious that it is the outcome of purely pantheistic ideas; unconscious life is regarded
          as the basis and source of conscious life, and every earthly being is conceived of as
          having lain in nature's womb, an inseparable part of her until the moment when
          consciousness began. One of the germs of the poetry of the new century lies in this little
          poem; for here, in place of the cultivated human being as developed and extolled by the
          eighteenth century, we have the human being as seen by the new era in the circle of his
          kin–birds and wild beasts, plants and stones. Christianity commanded men to love their
          fellow-men; pantheism bade them love the meanest animal. <emph>Hart-Leap Well</emph>, undoubtedly one
          of Wordsworth's finest poems, a simple little romance in two parts, is a movingly eloquent
          plea for a poor, ill-used animal, a hunted stag–that is to say, a creature in whom the
          classical poets would have been interested only in the shape of venison, and belonging to
          the species which the admirers of the age of chivalry, including Scott himself, would have
          allowed their heroes to kill by the hundred. Deeply affecting, in spite of the comparative
          insignificance of its subject, grandly simple in its style, the little poem is a noble <pb n="40"/> evidence of the heartfelt <emph>piety</emph> towards nature which is Wordsworth's patent of
          nobility.</p>

        <p>This piety in his case consists mainly in reverence for the childlike, and for the child.
          And this same reverence for the human being who in his unconsciousness is nearest to
          nature, is another of the characteristic features of the new century. In a little poem
          with which Wordsworth himself introduces all the rest, he writes:–</p>

        
        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»My heart leaps up when I behold</l> 
          <l>A rainbow in the sky:</l>
          <l>So was it when my life began,</l>
          <l>So is it now I am a man,</l>
          <l>So be it when I shall grow old,</l>
          <l>Or let me die!</l>
          <l>The Child is father of the Man:</l>

        <p>Here we have reverence for the child developed to such an extent that it supplants
          reverence for age. But this conferring of his natural poetic rights on the child is, as
          the history of every country shows us, only one of the many signs of the reaction against
          the eighteenth century's worship of the enlightened, social human being, and its
          banishment of the child to the nursery. Wordsworth carries the reaction inaugurated by the
          nineteenth century to its logical conclusion. In one of his sonnets he describes a walk
          which he takes on a beautiful evening with a little girl. After describing the tranquil
          evening mood–</p>

        </lg></quote></cit>


        <p>he turns to the child beside him, and says:</p>

        
        <cit><quote><lg><l>»Dear child! dear girl! that walkest with me here,</l>
          <l>If thou appear untouched by solemn thought</l>
          <l>Thy nature is not therefore less <emph>divine</emph>;</l>
          <l>Thou liest in Abraham's bosom all the year,</l>
          <l>And worship'st at the Temple's <emph>inner shrine</emph>,</l>
          <l>God being with thee when we know it not.«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>


        <p>The pious ending is inevitable with Wordsworth; but, as any intelligent reader may see
          for himself, it is only <pb n="41"/> tacked on to the main idea, that of the child's own divine nature.
          In his famous <emph>Ode on Intimations of Immortality</emph> Wordsworth develops this idea with a
          fervour of enthusiasm which carried him too great a length for even such a devotee of
          naïveté as Coleridge. A child of six he apostrophises thus:–</p>


<cit><quote><lg>
  <l>»Thou, whose exterior semblance doth belie</l>
  <l>Thy soul's immensity;</l> 
  <l>Thou best philosopher, who yet dost keep</l>
  <l>Thy heritage; thou eye among the blind.</l>
  <l>That, deaf and silent, read'st the eternal deep,</l>
  <l>Haunted for ever by the eternal Mind,–</l> 
  <l>Mighty Prophet! Seer blest!</l>
  <l>On whom those truths do rest</l>
  <l>Which we are toiling all our lives to find.«</l>
</lg></quote></cit>


        <p>These assertions are, doubtless, explained away in a poetico-philosophical manner by the
          subsequent attribution of the child's greatness to the fact that it stands nearer than we
          do to the life before birth, and, consequently, to the »intimations of immortality«; but
          even this is not to be taken as Wordsworth's literal meaning, if we are to believe an
          assertion of Coleridge's which remained uncontradicted by the author. The child is revered
          as earth's »foster-child,« and</p>

        <p>In numerous poems Wordsworth refers to the strong impression made upon him as a youth by
          the pageantry of nature. In one of them, to which, according to his frequent custom, he
          gave a prolix title, <emph>Influence of Natural Objects in Calling Forth and Strengthening the
          Imagination in Boyhood and Early Youth</emph>, he thanks the Spirit of the Universe for having

        <p>This is a picture of nature which it would be difficult to match in later English
          poetry.</p>

        <p>In one of his most beautiful and profound poems, <emph>Lines Composed a few Miles above
          Tintern Abbey</emph>, Wordsworth has described his own feeling for nature in expressions which
          he declared that he recognised again in the most famous and most poetical passages of
          Byron's <emph>Childe Harold</emph>, and which, in any case, were indisputably epoch-making in English
          poetical art. He writes:–</p>


        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»For nature then</l>
          <l>(The coarser pleasures of my boyish days,</l>
          <l>And their glad animal movements all gone by)</l>
          <l>To me was all in all.–I cannot paint</l>
          <l>What then I was. The sounding cataract</l>
          <l>Haunted me like a passion: the tall rock,</l>
          <l>The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,</l>
          <l>Their colours and their forms, were then to me</l>
          <l>An appetite: a feeling and a love,</l>
          <l>That had no need of a remoter charm,</l>
          <l>By thought supplied, nor any interest</l>
          <l>Unborrowed from the eye.«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>


        <p>Granted that it was very absurd of Wordsworth to talk (to Moore in 1820) of Byron's
          plagiarisms from him, and to declare that the whole Third Canto of <emph>Childe Harold</emph> was
          founded on his style and sentiments–and granted that Lord John Russell is right when he
          remarks drily in this connection that if Wordsworth wrote the Third Canto of <emph>Childe
          Harold</emph>, it is his best work–it is, nevertheless, easy to understand that Wordsworth
          could not but feel as if, in the chief passages in that canto, and the celebrated passages
          about solitude in the earlier cantos, what was naturally expressed by him had been worked
          by Byron into a laboured and antithetical sort of declamation.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">[1] See Thomas Moore: <emph>Memoirs</emph>, iii. 161.</note> It is not difficult to <pb n="44"/> discern, in these outbursts, the wounded vanity of a narrow mind which felt itself
          eclipsed; but it cannot be denied that it really was Wordsworth who first struck the chord
          which Byron varied with such skill, nor that single striking and vivid lines of
          Wordsworth's had impressed themselves on Byron's memory. Who can read, for example, the
          following lines of <emph>Childe Harold</emph> (Canto iii. 72):–</p>

        
        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»I live not in myself; but I become</l>

        </lg></quote></cit>

        
        <p>without thinking of Wordsworth's verses just quoted? And who can deny that Byron, as it
          were, adopted Wordsworth's idea, and added thoughts of his own to it when he wrote
          (<emph>Childe Harold</emph>, iii. 75):–</p>

        
        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Are not the mountains, waves, and skies, a part</l> <l>Of me and of my soul, as I of them?</l>
          <l>Is not the love of these deep in my heart</l>
          <l>With a pure passion? should I not contemn</l>
          <l>All objects, if compared with these?«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>


        <p>Wordsworth, in <emph>Tintern Abbey</emph>, describes his passion for nature as something past, as
          something which only lasted for a moment during an age of transition, and very soon turned
          into reflection and questioning; but Byron's passion is a permanent feeling, the
          expression of his nature. In his case the Ego in its relations with nature is not forced
          into the strait-jacket of orthodox piety; no obstruction of dogma is set up between nature
          and him; in his mystical worship of it he feels himself one with it, and this without the
          help of any <emph>deus ex machine</emph>.</p>

        <p>Passion is not the special characteristic of Wordsworth's attitude to nature. The
          distinguishing quality in his perception and reproduction of natural impressions is of a
          more delicate and complex kind. The impression, although it is received by healthy,
          vigorously perceptive senses, is modified and subdued by pondering over it. It does not
          directly attune the poet to song. If Wordsworth can say, with <pb n="45"/> Goethe: »I sing like the
          bird that sits on the bough,« it is, at any rate, not like the nightingale that he sings;
          his is not the love-song which streams forth, rich and full, telling of the intoxication
          of the soul and breaking and mocking at the silence of the night. He himself, after
          describing the song of the nightingale in similar terms to these, adds (<emph>Poems of
          Imagination</emph>, x.):–</p>

        
        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»I heard a stock-dove sing or say</l>
          <l>His homely tale this very day;</l>
          <l>His voice was buried among trees,</l>
          <l>Yet to be come at by the breeze;</l>
          <l>He did not cease; but cooed–and cooed;</l>
          <l>And somewhat pensively he wooed:</l>
          <l>He sang of love with quiet blending,</l>
          <l>Slow to begin, and never ending;</l>
          <l>Of serious faith and inward glee;</l>
          <l>That was the song–the song for me!«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>


        <p>It was himself that Wordsworth tried to paint in describing the pensive, serious wooer.
          According to the custom of so many poets, he attempted to formulate his methods into a
          theory and to prove that all good poetry must possess the qualities of his own. All good
          poetry is, he says, »the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings. But poems to which any
          value can be attached were never produced on any variety of subjects but by a man who,
          being possessed of more than usual organic sensibility, had also <emph>thought long and
          deeply</emph>.« This theory he supports by the argument that a »our continued influxes of
          feeling are directed and modified by our thoughts, which are indeed the representatives of
          all our past feelings«–a profound and striking, if not scientifically satisfactory
          utterance, as well as an excellent characterisation of his own poetic thought and
          deliberation.</p>

        <p>His method consists, exactly defined, in storing up natural impressions, in order to
          dwell on and thoroughly assimilate them. Later they are brought forth from the soul's
          store-house and gazed on and enjoyed again. To understand this peculiarity of Wordsworth's
          is to have the key to his originality. In <emph>Tintern Abbey</emph> he tells how the direct,
          passionate joy in the beauties of nature which he felt <pb n="46"/> in his youth turned, in his riper
          years, into this quiet assimilation of the human-like moods of nature:–</p>

        
        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»That time is past,</l>
          <l>And all its aching joys are now no more,</l>
          <l>And all its dizzy raptures. Not for this</l>
          <l>Faint I, nor mourn, nor murmur; other gifts</l>
          <l>Have followed; for such loss, I would believe,</l>
          <l>Abundant recompense. For I have learned</l>
          <l>To look on nature, not as in the hour</l>
          <l>Of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes</l>
          <l>The still, sad music of humanity.</l>
          <l>Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power</l>
          <l>To chasten and subdue. And I have felt</l>
          <l>A presence that disturbs me with the joy</l>
          <l>Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime</l>
          <l>Of something far more deeply interfused,</l>
          <l>Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,</l>
          <l>And the round ocean, and the living air,</l>
          <l>And the blue sky, and in the mind of man:</l>
          <l>A motion and a spirit, that impels</l>
          <l>All thinking things, all objects of all thought,</l>
          <l>And rolls through all things.«</l></lg></quote></cit>


        <p>In this passage Wordsworth has delimited his territory, has poetically yet plainly
          indicated his special province. What a contrast to Byron, who seldom or never heard the
          human voice in nature, and certainly never except in harsh and grating tones–the man who
          in <emph>Childe Harold</emph> actually calls human life »a false nature–not in the harmony of
          things!«</p>

        <p>But we have not yet come to the most remarkable lines in <emph>Tintern Abbey</emph>, namely those in
          which Wordsworth describes the silent influence on the mind of the hoarded, carefully
          preserved impressions of nature. He writes:–</p>

        
        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»These beauteous forms,</l>
          <l>Through a long absence, have not been to me</l>
          <l>As is a landscape to a blind man's eye:</l>
          <l>But oft, in lonely rooms, and 'mid the din</l>
          <l>Of towns and cities, I have owed to them,</l>
          <l>In hours of weariness, sensations sweet,</l>
          <l>Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart,</l>
          <l>And passing even into my purer mind,</l>
          <l>With tranquil restoration:–feelings, too,</l>
          <l>Of unremembered pleasure: such, perhaps,</l>
          <l><pb n="47"/> As have no slight or trivial influence</l>
          <l>On that best portion of a good man's life,</l>
          <l>His little, nameless, unremembered acts</l>
          <l>Of kindness and of love.«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>

        <p>And he asserts that he is indebted to the influence of nature for yet another gift,</p>

        
        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood</l>
          <l>In which the burthen of the mystery,</l>
          <l>In which the heavy and the weary weight</l>
          <l>Of all this unintelligible world Is lightened«;</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>


        <p>and his train of thought reaches its conclusion in the feeling of assurance that this
          happiness produced in him by the sight of the familiar places is not mere momentary
          pleasure, but <emph>life and food for future years</emph>.</p>

        <p>Again and again this last idea recurs in Wordsworth's poetry. We have it very marked, for
          instance, in No. xv. of the <emph>Poems of Imagination</emph>, in which he tells of the impression
          produced on him, during a lonely walk, by the sudden sight of »a host of golden
          daffodils,«</p>


        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Beside the lake, beneath the trees,</l> 
          <l>Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.</l>
          <l>…</l>
          <l>I gazed–and gazed–but little thought</l>
          <l>What wealth the show to me had brought.</l></lg>

        <lg>
          <l>For oft when on my couch I lie</l>
          <l>In vacant or in pensive mood,</l>
          <l>They flash upon that inward eye</l>
          <l>Which is the bliss of solitude,</l>
          <l>And then my heart with pleasure fills,</l>
          <l>And dances with the daffodils.«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>


        <p>Nothing could be more unlike the lyric poet's usual habit of living in the present, than
          this lyric poet's conscious saving of the present for future use. He himself tells us that
          he is of a saving disposition; he collects a winter store of bright summer moments; and
          there is in this something genuinely human, which is too often overlooked. But there is,
          above all, something national in it; it is not <pb n="48"/> surprising that <emph>English</emph> Naturalism should
          begin by carefully and economically providing itself with a store, a capital, of
          impressions of nature.</p>

        <p>We are all familiar with the feelings that might lead to the attempt. Many of us, gazing
          on the boundless blue ocean, sparkling in the sunlight, have felt that to have this sight
          before our eyes every day would widen the soul and cleanse it of all its little
          meannesses; and we have turned away unwillingly and with the conscious desire to preserve
          the impression so as to be able to renew its effect. Or with beautiful landscapes before
          our eyes, especially those which we have seen in the course of travel, with the certainty
          of not being able to enjoy their beauty soon again, we have tried to be as passive as
          possible, so as to allow the picture to impress itself firmly on our memory. And we have
          often instinctively recalled the beautiful scene to mind; for the soul involuntarily calls
          up bright memories to draw strength and courage from them. But in us such impressions have
          been almost effaced by stronger ones. We have not been able to preserve them efficaciously
          for the future, or to ruminate over them again and again. The preoccupations of society
          and of our own passions have made it impossible for us to find our deepest and most
          inspiring joy in memories of sunlight falling upon flowers, or of entwisted giant trees.
          But the soul of the English poet, whose mission it was to re-awaken the feeling for all
          these elementary moods and impressions, was of a different stamp; unagitated by any
          practical activity, it vegetated in these day-dreams of natural beauty. And it is
          undeniable that this constant occupation of himself with the simplest natural impressions,
          kept his soul pure and free to perceive and to feel beauty in its simple, earthly
          manifestations, without fancifulness and without excitement.</p>

        <p>How rare is this capacity! how often wanting in the very greatest and best minds! And how
          quickly was it lost again in English poetry! It displays itself most exquisitely and
          completely in the few lightly-sketched female figures of the short poems. The heroes and
          heroines of the narrative poems, some of them portrayed with the design of arousing
          sympathy with <pb n="49"/> the rural population and the lowest classes, others with the intention of
          edifying, are of distinctly inferior quality. But these few delicately-drawn figures, seen
          with the same tranquil and yet loving eyes with which Wordsworth looked at trees and
          birds, are nature itself. They are the English feminine nature; and never have the
          essential qualities of this nature been more exactly expressed. Take as an example of what
          I mean, the following little poem:–</p>


        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»She was a phantom of delight</l>
          <l>When first she gleamed upon my sight;</l>
          <l>A lovely apparition, sent</l>
          <l>To be a moment's ornament;</l>
          <l>Her eyes as stars of twilight fair;</l>
          <l>Like twilight's too, her dusky hair:</l>
          <l>But all things else about her drawn</l>
          <l>From May-time and the cheerful dawn;</l>
          <l>A dancing shape, an image gay,</l>
          <l>To haunt, to startle, and waylay.</l></lg>

        <lg><l>I saw her upon nearer view,</l>
          <l>A spirit, yet a woman too!</l>
          <l>Her household motions light and free,</l>

          <l>For human nature's daily food;</l>

          <l>The reason firm, the temperate will,</l>
          <l>Endurance, foresight, strength, and skill;</l>
          <l>A perfect woman, nobly planned,</l>
          <l>To warn, to comfort, and command;</l>
          <l>And yet a spirit still, and bright</l>
          <l>With something of angelic light.«</l></lg></quote></cit>


        <p>This is a genuine, faithful portrait of the pattern English woman; and to compare this
          sober, truthful description with the ideal women whom the greatest English poets a few <pb n="50"/> years later found satisfaction in depicting, is to prepare an easy victory for Wordsworth.
          Take Shelley's description, in <emph>The Sensitive Plant</emph>, of the ethereal protectress of
          flowers and insects. The picture of the fairy-like beauty is charming, as everything is
          that comes from Shelley's pen; her tenderness for the plants and her touching compassion
          for all the small, ugly, despised animals, »the poor banished insects, whose intent,
          although they did ill, was innocent,« are genuine human traits; and yet she is not a real
          human being, any more than the Witch of Atlas is, or the dim heroine of <emph>Epipsychidion</emph>.
          Shelley, like the lark he sang of, was a »scorner of the ground.« Or take the passionate
          Oriental heroines of Byron's earliest poetic narratives–Medora, Gulnare, Kaled. They
          never attain to the beautiful simplicity of this woman described by Wordsworth. Their
          passionateness is the principal quality impressed upon us; their love, their devotion,
          their determination know no bounds. They are heroines invented for readers in whom the
          numbing life of crowded London and the constant occupation with contemporary great
          historical events, have induced a kind of nervous craving for the strongest intellectual
          stimulants. But from the very beginning Wordsworth regarded it as a pleasant and
          profitable task to show how profoundly men's minds may be moved without the employment of
          coarse or violent stimulants. He knew that those who were accustomed to striking effects
          would be unlikely at first to appreciate works the distinguishing feature of which was
          their soft and natural colouring; but he resolved that he would turn the reader's
          expectations in the matter of the agencies of a poem back into the natural track.</p>

        <p>It is impossible thoroughly to understand Wordsworth's poetic strength and limitations
          without a glance at his life. We discover it to have been an unusually idyllic and
          comfortable one. Belonging to the well-to-do middle class (his father was an attorney), he
          studied at Cambridge and then travelled. In 1795, not long after his return from abroad,
          he received a legacy of £900 from an admirer of his genius, which, added to his share of a
          debt of £8500 due to his father by an English nobleman, and paid to the family about this
          time, placed him in a position to live without taking up any profession. In 1802 he
          married; in 1813 he settled at Rydal Mount in the Lake district. He held the appointment
          of Distributor of Stamps, which was practically a sinecure, from 1813 to 1842, when he
          resigned in favour of one of his sons. The salary of this appointment was £500. In 1843 he
          succeeded Southey as Poet Laureate, and as such enjoyed a pension of £300 a year till his
          death, which occurred in 1850, when he had just completed his eightieth year. Sheltered on
          every side from the outward vicissitudes of life, he regarded them from a
          Protestant-philosophical point of view.</p>

        <p>A career such as this was not calculated to stir the passions; nor is passion
          discoverable either in Wordsworth's life or his poetry. In the lives of most eminent
          authors we find some preponderant circumstance, one or more turning-points, one or other
          ostensible source of melancholy, or of strength of character, or of productivity; in
          Wordsworth's nothing of the kind is to be found. No congenital misfortune crippled him, no
          implacably violent animosity goaded him and set its mark on his spirit. The critics did <pb n="52"/> not spare him with mockery and contempt, and they continued their attacks for a long time.
          From 1800 to 1820 his poetry was trodden underfoot; from 1820 to 1830 it struggled; after
          1830 it received universal recognition. But the animosity was not stupid and violent
          enough, the struggle was not hot enough, the victory not brilliant enough, to give colour
          and lustre to his career, or to make it a subject of song. His inmost, personal life was
          never so intense that it could absorb his poetry or provide it with subjects. On the
          contrary, it led him to look outwards. The wars on the Continent, the natural surroundings
          of his home, and the little, insignificant set of human beings amongst whom he lived,
          engrossed his thoughts. He was not, like Byron, too much absorbed in his own affairs to
          have tranquillity of mind to dwell upon the small things and the small people whom he
          exhibits and describes with tender sympathy.</p>

        <p>He undoubtedly felt himself the centre of his world. From his retired, idyllic home there
          issued from time to time collections of short poems or single long ones, provided with
          explanatory prefaces which, piling example on example, demonstrated to the reader that all
          great poets have been misunderstood or despised by their contemporaries; that every
          author, in so far as he is great and at the same time original, is obliged to create the
          taste by means of which his works can be enjoyed. His predecessors have, no doubt,
          smoothed the way for all that he has in common with them; but for what is peculiarly his
          own he is in the condition of Hannibal among the Alps. (Preface of 1815.)</p>

        <p>Wordsworth was well aware that no intellectual pioneer can expect complete recognition
          from any but his younger contemporaries. But the criticism meted out to him, which was not
          aggressive enough to rouse in him a recklessly bellicose spirit like Byron's, made him
          self-absorbed and arrogant. The one variety in his daily life was provided by occasional
          visits from admirers who were making a tour in the neighbourhood and had letters of
          introduction to him. These strangers he received surrounded by his admiring family; he
          conversed with them in a cold and dignified <pb n="53"/> manner, and not unfrequently repelled them by
          the egotism with which he quoted and praised his own works, the indifference he manifested
          to everything else, the rigour with which he insisted on every outward sign of respect
          being shown him, and the solemnity with which he repeated even the most insignificant
          things that had been said in his praise.</p>

        <p>A number of anecdotes illustrating his egotism have been preserved. Thomas Moore
          (<emph>Memoirs</emph>, iii. 163) tells how one day, in a large party, Wordsworth, without anything
          having been previously said to introduce the subject, called out suddenly from the top of
          the table to the bottom: »Davy, do you know the reason why I published the 'White Doe' in
          quarto?« »No, what was it?« »To show the world my opinion of it.« He never read any works
          aloud but his own. At the time when <emph>Rob Roy</emph>, which has a motto taken from one of his
          poems, was published, he happened to be visiting a family who received the book the day it
          came out. They were all looking forward with eagerness to the new tale. Wordsworth seized
          the book, and every one expected him to read the first chapters aloud; but instead of
          doing this, he went to the bookcase, took out a volume of his own poetry, and read his
          poem aloud to the company.</p>

        <p>We have Emerson's notes written immediately after two different visits to Wordsworth,
          paid with a year's interval. After the second, he writes: »He was nationally bitter on the
          French: bitter on Scotchmen too. No Scotchman, he said, can write English.... His opinions
          of French, English, Irish, and Scotch seemed rashly formalised from little anecdotes of
          what had befallen himself and members of his family, in a diligence or stage-coach.« After
          his first visit (in 1833) Emerson writes: »He had much to say of America, the more that it
          gave occasion for his favourite topic–that society is being enlightened by a superficial
          tuition, out of all proportion to its being restrained by moral culture. Schools do no
          good. Tuition is not education.... He wished to impress on me and all good Americans to
          cultivate the moral, the conservative, &amp;c.... He pro<pb n="54"/>ceeded to abuse Goethe's <emph>Wilhelm
          Meister</emph> heartily. It was full of all manner of fornication. It was like the crossing of
          flies in the air. He had never gone farther than the first part; so disgusted was he that
          he threw the book across the room.... He cited his sonnet 'On the Feelings of a
          High-minded Spaniard' which he preferred to any other (I so understood him), and 'The Two
          Voices'; and quoted, with evident pleasure, the verses addressed to the Skylark.« These
          jottings give us an excellent idea of what Wordsworth was in ordinary intercourse: the
          contemptuous verdicts passed on all foreign races, the objection to modern civilisation
          (the same which the Mohammedans in Asia and Africa prefer against it to this day) that it
          is compatible with great immorality; the eulogy on conventional morality as the
          society-preserving element (true morality being the most radical element in existence),
          the displeasure with Goethe (which reminds us of Novalis), and the recital of his own
          verses as finale!</p>

        <p>Emerson sums up his impressions in the following words: »His face sometimes lighted up,
          but his conversation was not marked by special force or elevation.... He honoured himself
          by his simple adherence to truth, and was very willing not to shine; but he surprised by
          the hard limits of his thought. To judge from a single conversation, he made the
          impression of a narrow and very English mind; of one who paid for his rare elevation by
          general tameness and conformity.«</p>

        <p>In 1843 Wordsworth and Dickens met for the first time. Wordsworth had a great contempt
          for all young men, and the mutual friend at whose house the meeting took place was,
          consequently, curious to learn his impression of the great humorist. »After pursing up his
          lips in a fashion peculiar to him, and swinging one leg over the other, the bare flesh of
          his ankles appearing over his socks, Wordsworth slowly answered, 'Why, I am not much given
          to turn critic on people I meet; but, as you ask me, I will candidly avow that I thought
          him a very talkative, vulgar young person–but I dare say he may be very clever. Mind, I
          don't want to say a word against him, for I have never read <pb n="55"/> a line he has written.« Some
          time after this the same querist guardedly asked Dickens how he had liked the Poet
          Laureate? »Like him? Not at all. He is a dreadful old ass.«<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">R. S. Mackenzie: <emph>Life of Dickens</emph>, p. 243.</note></p>

        <p>The reader will naturally refuse to subscribe to so sweeping a judgment. But so much is
          certain, that in private intercourse there must have been something extremely irritating
          about Wordsworth. A contemporary declares that when he spoke he blew like a whale, and
          uttered truisms in an oracular tone. The word »truism« is applicable to more than his
          verbal utterances; it applies to the whole reflective and didactic side of his poetry. In
          it there is no remarkable force or passion, but a Hamlet-like dwelling upon the great
          questions of »to be or not to be.« »Birth, death, the future, the sufferings and misdeeds
          of man in this life, and his hopes of a life to come; the littleness of us and our whole
          sphere of knowledge, and the awful relations in which we stand to a world of the
          supernatural–these, if any,« says Masson, »are the permanent and inevitable objects of
          all human, as they were peculiarly of Wordsworth's, contemplation and solicitude.«<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Masson: <emph>Wordsworth, Shelley, Keats, and other Essays</emph>.</note> But
          these ideas, lying, as they do, rather at the circumference of the sphere of our knowledge
          than within it, unfortunately tempt us into certain ancient and well-worn tracks of
          thought that lead nowhere; they go round in a ring, and we can follow them with a tranquil
          and dignified melancholy, but without much benefit either to ourselves or others. The fact
          that Wordsworth is perpetually finding his way to this said circumference of the sphere of
          our knowledge, which adherents of the so-called revealed religions regard as the natural
          centre of our thoughts, has contributed more than anything else to prevent his fame, great
          as it is in England, from spreading to any considerable extent in other countries.</p>

        <p>When Coleridge made Wordsworth's personal acquaintance, the latter had already written
          enough to show plainly what was the nature of his originality. What struck Coleridge in
          Wordsworth's poetry »was the union of deep <pb n="56"/> feeling with profound thought; the fine balance
          of truth in observing, with the imaginative faculty in modifying the objects observed;
          and, above all, the original gift of spreading the tone, the atmosphere of the ideal world
          around forms, incidents, and situations of which, for the common view, custom had bedimmed
          all the lustre.«</p>

        <p>Wordsworth and Coleridge's first conversations turned upon what to them appeared the two
          cardinal points of poetry, the power of exciting the sympathy of the reader by a faithful
          adherence to the truth of nature, and the power of giving the interest of novelty by the
          modifying colours of imagination. The sudden charm which accidents of light and shade,
          which moonlight or sunset, diffuse over a known and familiar landscape, appeared to
          represent the practicability of combining both. These are the poetry of nature, and these
          were to be reproduced. It was not simply nature that was to be imitated, but the poetry of
          nature.</p>

        <p>The thought suggested itself that a series of poems might be composed of two sorts. In
          the one the incidents and agents were to be, in part at least, supernatural, and the
          excellence aimed at was to consist in the interesting of the affections by the dramatic
          truth of such emotions as would naturally accompany such situations, supposing them real.
          And real in this sense they have been to every human being who, from whatever source of
          delusion, has at any time believed himself to be under supernatural agency. The execution
          of this part of the undertaking fell to Coleridge's share, and there can be no doubt
          whatever that the successful accomplishment of it was due to him. Any one at all well
          acquainted with European literature sees at once how closely related this task is to those
          which German Romanticism set itself and accomplished. The only thing peculiarly English
          is, that the emphasis is not laid upon the supernatural and fantastic, but upon the
          realistic element, so that Romanticism in this case becomes simply one of the forms of
          Naturalism.</p>

        <p>In the poems of the other sort the themes were to be chosen from real life. But
          Wordsworth, to whose share this division fell, resolved to communicate to the commonest
          and most natural events an unusual, new, almost supernatural colour by <pb n="57"/> awakening the mind
          from the slumber of custom, and forcing it to direct its attention to the beauty and the
          marvels which the natural world is constantly offering to heedless man. He made the
          attempt for the first time in the <emph>Lyrical Ballads</emph>, which in the preface are designated
          an »Experiment«–an experiment intended to prove the possibility of making themes unsuited
          to ornate representation attractive, even when presented to the reader in the language of
          real life–and he repeated it in hundreds of poems of extremely varied quality, whose
          heroes and heroines all belong to the lower and lowest classes, have followed rural
          avocations from their youth, and are represented on a background of rural life.</p>

        <p>In Danish literature there is no series of poems of this description; but the careful
          student of Wordsworth will every now and then be reminded, by the form given to a poetic
          anecdote or by the tone of the narrator, of (the Swedish poet) Runeberg's <emph>Fänrik Stål</emph>.
          There is occasionally even a resemblance of rhythm and metre. It would be interesting to
          know if Runeberg had any acquaintance with the works of the English poet. Possibly the
          whole faint resemblance is due to the fact that the incidents in the poems of both writers
          all occur in one small district–the neighbourhood of the English, and the neighbourhood
          of the Finnish Lakes. The difference is far more striking than the resemblance. In
          Runeberg we have a warlike background and mood, a fiery lyric style, patriotic ardour; in
          Wordsworth, stagnant, rurally peaceful life, an epic attitude, and a purely local
          patriotism–attachment to the life and history of a couple of parishes. Runeberg's is a
          soldier's feeling for the army; Wordsworth's, a parish priest's for his flock.</p>

        <p><emph>Resolution and Independence</emph>, one of Wordsworth's most characteristic, though certainly
          not one of his best poems, is a good example of his capacity and manner of casting over
          the most everyday incidents and phenomena a tinge of almost supernatural colour. The poet
          describes his walk on a summer morning–the glistening of the dew, the song of the birds,
          the fleet racing of the hare across the moor. Then it occurs to him that he himself has
          lived as thought<pb n="58"/>lessly as the beasts of the field and the birds of the air, and that such
          a life is only too likely one day to bring its own punishment. He calls to mind how many
          great poets have ended in misery, and the most prosaic fears for the future depress him.
          Then suddenly, in that lonely place, he comes upon an old man:–</p>


       <cit><quote><lg>
         <l>»The oldest man he seemed that ever wore grey hairs.</l>
       </lg>

        <lg><l>As a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie</l>
          <l>Couched on the bald top of an eminence;</l>
          <l>Wonder to all who do the same espy,</l>
          <l>By what means it could thither come and whence;</l>
          <l>So that it seems a thing endued with sense:</l>
          <l>Like a sea-beast crawled forth, that on a shelf</l>
          <l>Of rock or sand reposeth, there to sun itself;</l></lg>

        <lg><l>Such seemed this man, not all alive nor dead,</l>
          <l>Nor all asleep–in his extreme old age:</l>
          <l>His body was bent double, feet and head</l>
          <l>Coming together in life's pilgrimage;</l>
          <l>As if some dire constraint of pain, or rage</l>
          <l>Of sickness felt by him in times long past,</l>
          <l>A more than human weight upon his frame had cast.</l>
          <l>…</l>
          <l>Motionless as a cloud the old man stood,</l>
          <l>That heareth not the loud winds when they call;</l>
          <l>And moveth all together, if it move at all.«</l>
</lg></quote></cit>
     
        
        <p>How clever the double simile is, and what a feeling of mystery it produces! The old man
          is like the gigantic stone on the top of the hill; and the stone in its turn resembles
          some sea-beast which must have crawled up there. The impression of great age is most
          forcibly produced. This old man seems the oldest man that has ever lived. If we were in
          Germany or any other territory of Romanticism, we should not be surprised to learn that we
          had the shoemaker of Jerusalem before us. But we are in England, and our guide is
          Wordsworth; and the old man turns out to be a most ordinary human being, by trade a
          leech-gatherer, an occupation suited to the capacity of the frail old inhabitants of a
          marshy district. The old man's confident, piously resigned words, his tranquillity of mind <pb n="59"/> even in extreme loneliness and poverty, allay the young man's fears for the future; and he
          resolves, whenever such fears beset him, to think of the leech-gatherer on the lonely
          moor. »This is not ode-flight,« as Ewald remarks somewhere or other; but it is a good
          specimen of Wordsworth's power of giving a certain imprint of fantasy and grandeur to the
          most everyday, most realistic material by his manner of treating it.</p>

        <p>The attempt to exercise this capacity has, in not a few of Wordsworth's poems, resulted
          in caricature. It has always done so when he has tried to produce a mystically religious
          or terrifying effect by endowing some simply painful or odd incident with the so-called
          supernatural quality. We can call it nothing but childish when, in the poem entitled <emph>The
          Thorn</emph>, the narrator (whose position in life is not indicated, but whom Wordsworth himself
          told Coleridge he had imagined as an old ship captain, almost in his dotage) tells in the
          strain of horror with which one relates a ghost story, the tale of the poor mad woman who
          sits at night in a scarlet cloak, weeping and wailing, under the thorn tree. And <emph>Peter
          Bell</emph>, the poem which Wordsworth presented to the public with such a flourish of trumpets,
          but which, had it not been for Shelley's satire of the same name, would have been
          forgotten by this time, produces the effect of a parody. It tells of the terror induced in
          a coarse, cruel man by the supernatural fortitude with which a poor ass bears the most
          terrible blows rather than move–a terror which, in combination with the excited
          imaginings due to the darkness, brings about a complete change in the man. Time showed the
          reason of the ass's fortitude to have been its desire to draw attention to the fact that
          its master had fallen into the river at the spot where it was standing. We have here a
          striking contrast–the moral greatness of the brute and the brutish stupidity of the
          man–and Wordsworth, who had no sense of the comic, did not fail to enlarge on the
          subject.</p>

        <p>And that he does so is not a mere accident, but a characteristic trait. The new school,
          with its dislike of the brilliant and its love of the simple and plain, felt a <pb n="60"/> real
          attraction towards asses, these obstinate, patient, and peculiarly misunderstood children
          of nature, which are always outshone by less contented animals. Coleridge, in his poem,
          <emph>To a Young Ass–its mother being tethered near it</emph>, allowed himself to be carried away by
          his enthusiasm to the extent of exclaiming: »I hail thee Brother!« and declaring that if
          it were granted him in a better and more equitably ordered state of society to provide
          peaceful pasture for this ass, its joyful bray would sound more melodious in his ears than
          the sweetest music. It is not surprising that the scoffer Byron promptly made merry over
          this fraternal greeting in his first satire, <emph>English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</emph>. But in
          Coleridge this extreme Naturalism did not go deep; he himself was the first to denounce
          his own excesses. Wordsworth, on the contrary, who was by nature consistent, not to say
          obstinate, carried purely literary Naturalism to its final and extreme conclusions.</p>

        <p>He almost always chose his themes from humble and rustic life; and this he did, not for
          the same reason as the French writers of the previous century, who, themselves elegant and
          cultivated, enjoyed inelegance and uncultivatedness with a feeling of superiority, but
          because he believed that in that condition of life the essential passions of the heart
          find a better soil in which they can attain their maturity, are less under restraint, and
          speak a plainer language. He was of opinion that in that condition our elementary feelings
          co-exist in a state of greater simplicity, and consequently may be more accurately
          contemplated than in town life; and he was also persuaded that constant association with
          the beautiful and permanent forms of nature, in combination with the necessary and
          unchanging character of rural occupations, must make all feelings more durable and
          strong.</p>

        <p>Here, at the moment of the century's birth, we find the germs of the æsthetic movement,
          which, spreading from country to country, continued for more than fifty years to produce,
          in Germany, France, and Scandinavia, peasant poetry and peasant tales, and in several
          countries a cult of the peasant dialect. By dissecting these germs in the manner of the
          botanist, we shall learn the complete natural history of the plant.</p>

        <p><pb n="61"/> Wordsworth's point of departure is purely <emph>topographical</emph>. There is more topography,
          taking the word in its widest sense, in his works than even in Scott's. His life-task was
          to describe English nature and English natures as he saw them, face to face. He would
          never describe anything with which he was not perfectly familiar, and he finally evolved
          the theory that it was necessary for every poet to associate himself closely with some one
          particular spot. He associated himself with the English Lake district, which provided him
          with backgrounds for most of his poems. He went so far as to assert that the birthplace of
          the individual is the place best suited to be the scene of the activity of his whole
          life.</p>

        <p>Thus it was that he became the painter specially of English nature, and that his
          descriptions have an essentially local interest. Ruskin was right when he called
          Wordsworth the great poetical landscape painter of the period. Whilst Byron time after
          time escaped from his own country to paint the nature of Greece and the East in glowing
          foreign colours; whilst Shelley shrank from the climate of England as death to a man of
          his delicate constitution, and never wearied of extolling the coast and rivers of Italy;
          whilst Scott sang the praises of Scotland, and Moore tirelessly proclaimed the beauty of
          green Erin, Wordsworth stood alone as the pure-bred Englishman, deep-rooted in his native
          soil as some old spreading oak. His ambition was to be a true English descriptive poet. He
          had the most intimate, circumstantial acquaintance with the life of the lower classes, and
          the rural life generally, of the district in which he had his home, walked, sailed, went
          to church, and received visits from his admirers. He has the same eye for it as a worthy
          and benevolent parish priest of the type he describes in <emph>The Excursion</emph>. To his special
          province belong all the events and calamities of common occurrence in an English country
          parish–the return of a totally forgotten son of the place, to find his home gone and the
          names of those dear to him carved on gravestones (<emph>The Brothers</emph>); the fate of a deceived
          and deserted girl (<emph>Ruth</emph>); an idiot boy's night ride for the doctor, with its mischances
          (<emph>The Idiot Boy</emph>); the strange <pb n="62"/> adventure of a blind Highland boy, with its fortunate
          ending (<emph>The Blind Highland Boy</emph>); the sorrow caused to an excellent father by the
          degeneracy of his son (<emph>Michael</emph>); the unfortunate carouse of a carrier beloved by the
          whole district, and his consequent dismissal from his post (described in four cantos under
          the title <emph>The Waggoner</emph>).</p>

        <p>The only thing un-English about the manner in which these events, even the more cheerful
          and amusing ones, are communicated to us, is the complete absence of humour. In the place
          of humour Wordsworth has, as Masson aptly puts it, »a hard, benevolent smile.« But the
          pathos with which he relates the tragic or serious among these simple local stories is
          pure and heartfelt. It has neither the Pythian tremor nor modern fervour, but its effect
          is all the more powerful in the case of the great majority of readers, who prefer that the
          poet should not rise too high above their level, and are conscious of the helpful, healing
          quality in the compassion which is the source of the pathos–a compassion which resembles
          that of the clergyman or the doctor, and which, though less spontaneous than professional,
          moves us by the perfection of its expression.</p>

        <p>Nowhere more beautiful is this expression than in such poems as <emph>Simon Lee</emph> and <emph>The Old
          Cumberland Beggar</emph>. The former tells of an old huntsman who in his youth had surpassed all
          others in his skill with hounds and horn, his fleetness on foot and on horseback, but who
          has become so feeble that when the poet meets him one day he is struggling in vain to
          unearth the rotten root of an old tree.</p>

        <p>Few poets have shown such beautiful reverence as Wordsworth for those humble ancients of
          the human race who, from no fault of their own, are helpless and useless. Of this <emph>The Old
          Cumberland Beggar</emph> is the best example. The poet tells how this man, whom every one knows,

        <p>Though it must be confessed that this is a sermon, it is a sermon in the very best style.
          In that same Naturalism which in due time consistently developed into pure humanism and
          revolt against convention, there was at first an inclination to admonition and to
          evangelic piety. It sought out the simple-hearted, the poor, the mean in the eyes of the
          world–for this was Gospel morality. It rejected the highly cultured, and chose as its
          heroes fishermen and peasants–in this also following Gospel example. Hence it is that we
          have in Wordsworth perfectly consistent worship of nature along with the exhortatory and
          evangelically homiletic element which finds such favour in England. And even his purely
          didactic poems are not to be indiscriminately rejected. There is often a peculiar grandeur
          in the manner in which the simple lesson is enforced. There is, for instance, real
          sublimity in the passage in <emph>Laodamia</emph> in which it is impressed upon the sorrowing wife
          that, instead of craving for the return of her husband, she ought to renounce her desire, <pb n="65"/> and purify herself through her love to enjoy another, nobler, more spiritual life:–</p>

        <p>Even the abstract <emph>Ode to Duty</emph>, which is inspired by an enthusiasm of the nature of

          the sublime paradoxes of the Fathers of the Church. It is to Duty that the poet cries:</p>

        </lg></quote></cit>


        <p>From all the poems of this species, however, the reader will quickly turn again to
          Wordsworth's specialty, his idylls.</p>

        <p>Let us cast another glance at these, and at the theory which their author intended them
          to illustrate. It is quite certain that Wordsworth attributed more poetical importance to
          the representation of rural life than is really its due. His surroundings were calculated
          to produce this theoretical overvaluation. The possibility of making heroes of the
          shepherd-farmers of Cumberland and Westmoreland was due to the fact that these men (who,
          though they were independent enough not to be compelled to work for others, were
          nevertheless obliged to lead an industrious, frugally simple life) possessed real poetical
          qualifications. The theory that rural life in itself improves and ennobles, is a
          superstition; it is quite as apt to dull and blunt. Coleridge has, for example, pointed
          out that when the manner in which the poor-laws were administered in Liverpool,
          Manchester, and Bristol, was compared with the manner in which relief was distributed in
          the country, the result was distinctly in favour of the towns.</p>

        <p>Wordsworth has, further, over-estimated the importance of the part which the
          representation of rural occupations plays in his own poetry. Not only do we observe that <pb n="66"/> many of the principal personages in his best poems (such as <emph>Ruth, Michael, The Brothers</emph>)
          are not expressly peasants or dwellers in the country; but we are also conscious that his
          passion for Naturalism and, in close connection with this, his inclination to try to edify
          by glorification of the lower classes, have often led him to attribute to a man or woman
          of low position, qualities and powers which there is little probability of his or her
          possessing. A paradox which he enounces with evident satisfaction in <emph>The Excursion</emph> is,
          that many a gifted poet exists, unsuspected, among the lower classes.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">

          It is satisfactory to a man with Wordsworth's religious tendencies to believe that talent is
          independent of wealth and outward position. But even allowing this to be true, would it
          not still be absurd to make the poet-hero of a poem a chimney-sweep by profession, and
          then explain in a carefully invented biography how it came to pass that he was, at one and
          the same time, poet, philosopher, and sweep? Only in real biography are such phenomena
          permissible; in fiction, Naturalism carried to such an extreme repels by its unlikeliness.
          And what difference is there between this and the many cases in which Wordsworth puts into
          the mouth of a pedlar, a leech-gatherer, a labourer, words which we cannot but be
          astonished to hear from such lips? Hence, to justify and explain his characters, he is
          obliged to introduce numbers of accidental, subordinate details of the kind required to
          prove the possibility of a fact in real life, but of the kind which we willingly forgo in
          poetry. The excessive attention paid to probability, the petty anxiety to explain the
          reason of everything, have a fatiguing effect–especially in the long introductions and
          descriptions in <emph>The Excursion</emph>, which Byron wittily calls Wordsworth's »eternal: Here we
          go up, up, and up, and here we go down, down, and here round about, round about!«</p>

        <p>Wordsworth's choice of themes leads him, moreover, to <pb n="67"/> a singularity in the matter of
          language which may be termed the extreme literary issue of this Naturalism. It was his
          theory that the language spoken by the class which he described was, when purified from
          its defects, the best of all, »because such men hourly communicate with the best objects
          from which the best part of language is originally derived; and because, from their rank
          in society and the sameness and narrow circle of their intercourse, being less under the
          influence of social vanity, they convey their feelings and emotions in simple and
          unelaborated expressions.« It is, consequently, his opinion, that it is impossible for any
          author to find a better manner of expression, no matter whether he is writing in prose or
          in verse. And this leads him to the enunciation of his famous and interesting paradox:
          <emph>that there neither is nor can be any essential difference between the language of prose
          and metrical composition</emph>. If this only meant disapprobation of all the tiresome and
          foolish distortions of language, to which the scarcity of rhymes and the lack of the gift
          of rhythm have driven so many of even the most eminent poets, we should heartily agree
          with him. Théodore de Banville has, with reason on his side–though it is the severe
          reason which demands the impossible–given as contents to the chapter in his <emph>Petit Traité
          de Poésie française</emph> entitled <emph>Licentia poetica</emph>, simply the words: »Il n'y en a pas.« But
          it is an entirely different meaning which Wordsworth intends his maxim to convey. He
          maintains not only that the language of a large portion of every good poem must
          necessarily, except with reference to the metre, in no respect differ from that of good
          prose, but likewise that some of the most interesting parts of the very best poems will be
          found to be strictly the language of prose. For, however lively and truthful the poet's
          language may be, there cannot be a doubt, says Wordsworth, that it must, in liveliness and
          truth, fall far short of that which is uttered by men in real life; in other words–it can
          never surpass, and only at its best approach, the prose of reality. This theory he
          defended with genuine English obstinacy against the attacks made upon it from every
          direction. He quotes, as a specimen of <pb n="68"/> the parodies of poetry in which the language
          closely resembles that of life and nature, Dr. Johnson's stanza:</p>

        
        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»I put my hat upon my head</l>
          <l>And walked into the Strand,</l>
          <l>And there I met another man,</l>
          <l>Whose hat was in his hand.«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>


        <p>This is not poetry, says the public. Granted! says Wordsworth. But the proper thing to be
          said is not: This is not poetry; but: This is wanting in meaning; it is neither
          interesting in itself, nor can it lead to anything interesting; consequently it cannot
          excite thought or feeling in the reader. »Why take pains to prove that an ape is not a
          Newton, when it is self-evident that he is not a man?« The accepted idea is, according to
          Wordsworth, that an author, by the act of writing in verse, makes a formal engagement that
          he will gratify certain known habits of association, that certain classes of idea and
          expression will be found in his book, but that others will be carefully excluded. This
          doctrine Wordsworth opposes with the declaration of his conviction of the similarity of
          good poetry and good prose, a conviction which was founded on dislike of poetic
          affectation, but which led him in his own poetry, now to the narrowest limitation, now to
          the utmost possible flattening out of his own in many respects masterly and model
          style.</p>

        <p>There is more than one argument against the extremely high estimation of the language of
          the rural population which forms Wordsworth's starting-point, and which is not without its
          resemblance to the cult of the peasant language initiated in Denmark by Grundtvig and in
          Norway by the »Maalstrævere« (agitators for the universal employment of a Norwegian based
          on the peasant dialects). The principal one is, that the language of the peasant,
          purified, as Wordsworth demands, from provincial expressions and subjected to the rules of
          grammar, is not different from that of any other sensible man, except in this, that the
          peasant's ideas are fewer and vaguer. By reason of its inferior degree of development, his
          mind dwells only upon single, isolated facts, drawn from <pb n="69"/> his own narrow experience, or
          from the records of traditional belief, whereas the educated man sees the connection
          between things, and seeks for universal laws. Wordsworth is of opinion that the <emph>best</emph>
          part of language is derived from the objects which surround and occupy the peasant. But
          the ideas connected with food, shelter, safety, comfort, are surely not those which
          provide the best part of language. Nor can we agree with him when he asserts that nothing
          but the infusion of a certain degree of passion into this language is required to entitle
          it to be called poetic; for passion neither creates new thoughts nor new provision of
          words; it only increases the force of those already in existence; it cannot be expected to
          make the language of daily intercourse poetry, when it is hardly capable of making it
          prose.</p>

        <p>What strikes us from the very first in Wordsworth's vindication of Naturalism is his
          confounding of two things–prose, and what he calls »ordinary language« terms which he
          applies indiscriminately. Good prose is language which has been purified from the vain and
          meaningless repetitions and the uncertain, halting phraseology which are the inevitable
          outcome of the confusion due to insufficient education. Wordsworth has too frequently
          neglected this purifying process, when introducing dramatic dialogue into his own poems.
          It is this unfortunate passion for the most grovellingly exact imitation, which produces
          the sudden and disagreeable transitions from passages in a noble, elevated style, to
          passages with no style at all. See, for example, <emph>The Blind Highland Boy</emph>.</p>

        <p>»Poetry,« says Wordsworth, »takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquillity.«
          The aim of the poet is the truthful imitation of nature, with the one restriction, that of
          the necessity of giving pleasure–not merely the straightforward, direct truth; therefore
          he employs the metrical form of composition, which provides the reader with small, but
          continual and regular impulses of pleasurable surprise. Metre produces its effect by
          continually arousing and satisfying curiosity, but in such a simple manner that it does
          not draw any separate attention to <pb n="70"/> itself. It acts powerfully but unobservedly upon the
          mind, like artificially altered air, or the wine drunk during an eager discussion. By its
          steady recurrence it tempers and modifies the excitement or pain produced by the
          intelligence communicated; and by its tendency to divest language of its reality, it
          throws a sort of half consciousness of unsubstantial existence over the whole composition.
          Except for this, declares Wordsworth, even the best poetry can in no respect differ from
          prose. He forgets to ask himself if there are not numbers of common phrases and
          expressions which, though they are perfectly allowable in prose, would produce a most
          unpleasant effect in poetry; and forgets, too, to ask if it is not possible that in every
          serious poem there may occur, without any artificiality, sentences of a construction, and
          imagery of a kind, which would be impossible in prose.</p>

        <p>The only way in which the best poetry corresponds with »the very language of men,« is in
          its expressions resembling those which some few of the most highly cultivated would use on
          the rarest occasions. In daily converse language wanders unrestrainedly; in public speech
          it is restrained by imperative connection and continuity of thought; in the prose work,
          the carefully elaborated sentence progresses naturally through all its twists and
          turnings; in verse, the form cannot be too exquisite or too compact. Here the doctrine
          applies which Théophile Gautier preached in his splendid poem, <emph>L'Art</emph>:–</p>

        <p>But, however much there is to be said against Wordsworth's poetics, or »prosaics,« as
          they might more correctly be <pb n="71"/> called–against theories which were at first accepted as
          synonymous with the »Fair is foul, and foul is fair« of the witches in Macbeth–they are
          in the highest degree interesting to the student of literature to-day as an accurate and
          unambiguous expression of the first literary extreme to which English Naturalism went.</p>

        <p>We have for a moment lost sight of Coleridge. When Wordsworth and he divided the new
          kinds of poetry between them, there fell to his share, as the reader will remember, a task
          which was the exact opposite of Wordsworth's, namely, the treating of supernatural
          subjects in a natural manner. He fulfilled it in his contributions to the volume published
          under the title of <emph>Lyrical Ballads</emph>, and indeed in the greater proportion of the little
          collection of poems which entitles him to rank high among English poets.</p>
        
        <p>Samuel Taylor Coleridge was a country boy, the son of a Devonshire clergyman. He was born
          in October 1772. From 1782 to 1790 he was at school in London. It was during those
          school-days, spent at Christ's Hospital, that his friendship with another English
          Romanticist, his warm admirer, Charles Lamb, was formed. From 1791 to 1793 he studied at
          Cambridge. He had neither means nor prospects, and in a fit of despair, occasioned either
          by his debts or by an unhappy love affair, he suddenly enlisted in the 15th Regiment of
          Light Dragoons, under the name of Silas Titus Cumberback.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">»Being at a loss, when suddenly asked my name, I answered Cumberback; and verily my
            habits were so little equestrian, that my horse, I doubt not, was of that opinion.«</note> It certainly does not seem to
          have been ambition (as in the case of Johannes Ewald a few years earlier) which prompted
          him to try his fortune as a soldier, but simply want of any other means of subsistence. He
          was only four months a dragoon. On the stable wall underneath his saddle, he one day
          scribbled the Latin lament:–</p>

          <l>»Eheu quam infortuni miserrimum est fuisse felicem!«</l>

        <!-- Illustration: S.T. Coleridge -->


        <p><pb n="73"/> This was discovered by his captain, who inquired into the position of affairs, and
          arranged with Coleridge's family for his return to Cambridge. On this followed the short
          period during which the young poet was an anti-orthodox democrat. As such he could expect
          no advancement in the University. His and Southey's glorification of Robespierre (the
          first act of <emph>The Fall of Robespierre</emph> was written by Coleridge, the second and third are
          Southey's) and their wild project of a communistic settlement have been already mentioned.
          The little emigrant society they founded consisted only of themselves and two other
          members, a young Quaker named Lovell, and George Burnet, a school friend of Southey's. But
          the God Hymen had decided that the year 1795 should witness the wreck of the plans which
          boded so ill for society. In 1795 Coleridge went to lecture at Bristol, where he displayed
          the eloquence which (as in the case of the similarly eloquent and persuasive Welhaven)
          seems to have sapped his power of poetic production. A young lady in the town of Bristol
          won his heart; and before the year was over, Sara Fricker was married to Coleridge, her
          sisters, Edith and Mary, to Lovell and Southey–and the emigration plan was abandoned.
          Coleridge, who was without will-power all his life, could never have carried out a plan
          laid so long beforehand. He never succeeded in doing anything except what he had not
          determined to do, or what, from its nature, could not be determined beforehand.</p>

        <p>In 1796 the young man, who was still an enthusiastic Unitarian, allowed himself to be
          persuaded by some other philanthropists–he is always »persuaded«–to publish a weekly
          magazine called <emph>The Watchman</emph>, which was to consist of thirty-two pages, large octavo,
          and to cost the reasonable price of fourpence. Its flaming prospectus bore the motto,
          »Knowledge is power.« With the object of enlisting subscribers, the young and ardent
          propagandist undertook a tour of the country between Bristol and Sheffield, preaching in
          most of the great towns, »as an hireless volunteer, in a blue coat and white waistcoat,
          that not a rag of the woman of Babylon might be seen on me.« The description he has given
          of this, his Odyssey, shows us the young English Romanticist <pb n="74"/> as he was then and as he
          continued to be–imprudent in worldly matters, enthusiastic in behalf now of this, now of
          that religious or political half-truth, yet with a humorous appreciation of his own and
          others' ridiculousness.</p>

        <p>»My campaign commenced at Birmingham; and my first attack was on a rigid Calvinist, a
          tallow-chandler by trade. He was a tall, dingy man, in whom length was so predominant over
          breadth that he might almost have been borrowed for a foundry poker. O that face! I have
          it before me at this moment. The lank, black, twine-like hair, <emph>pinguinitescent</emph>, cut in a
          straight line along the black stubble of his thin gunpowder eyebrows, that looked like a
          scorched after-math from a last week's shaving. His coat collar behind in perfect unison,
          both of colour and lustre, with the coarse yet glib cordage that I suppose he called his
          hair, and which with a bend inward at the nape of the neck (the only approach to flexure
          in his whole figure) slunk in behind his waistcoat; while the countenance, lank, dark,
          very hard, and with strong perpendicular furrows, gave me a dim notion of some one looking
          at me through a used gridiron, all soot, grease, and iron! But he was one of the
          thorough-bred, a true lover of liberty, and (I was informed) had proved to the
          satisfaction of many, that Mr. Pitt was one of the horns of the second beast in the
          Revelation, <emph>that spoke like a dragon</emph>.« For half-an-hour Coleridge employed all the
          resources of his eloquence–argued, described, promised, prophesied, beginning with the
          captivity of nations and ending with the millennium. »My taper man of lights listened with
          perseverance and praiseworthy patience, though (as I was afterwards told on complaining of
          certain odours that were not altogether ambrosial) it was a melting-day with him. 'And
          what, sir,' he said, after a short pause, 'might the cost be?' 'Only fourpence, only
          fourpence, sir, each number, to be published on every eighth day.' 'That comes to a good
          deal of money at the end of the year. And how much did you say there was to be for the
          money?' 'Thirty-two pages, sir! large octavo, closely printed.' 'Thirty and two pages?
          Bless me, why, except what I does in a family way on the Sabbath, that's more than I ever
          reads, sir! all the year round. I am <pb n="75"/> as great a one as any man in Brummagem, sir! for
          liberty and truth and all them sort of things, but as to this, no offence, sir, I must beg
          to be excused.'«</p>

        <p>Thus ended Coleridge's first attempt at recruiting for the war against the Holy Trinity.
          His second he made in Manchester, where he tried to enlist a stately and opulent wholesale
          dealer in cottons. This man measured him from top to toe, and asked if he had any bill or
          invoice of the thing. Coleridge presented him with the prospectus. He rapidly skimmed and
          hummed over the first side, and still more rapidly the second and concluding page, then
          most deliberately and significantly rubbed and smoothed one part against the other, put it
          in his pocket, turned his back with an »Overrun with these articles!« and retired into his
          counting-house.</p>

        <p>After these unsuccessful attempts, the young man gave up the plan of canvassing from
          house to house, but nevertheless returned from this memorable tour with almost a thousand
          names on his list of subscribers. But, alas! the publication of the very first number was,
          as any one knowing Coleridge might have expected, delayed beyond the day announced for its
          appearance; the second, which contained an essay against fast-days, lost him nearly five
          hundred subscribers at a blow; and the two following numbers, which were full of attacks
          on French philosophy and morals, and directed against those »who pleaded to the poor and
          ignorant instead of pleading for them,« made enemies of all his Jacobin and democratic
          patrons. Coleridge, who communicates all these details himself, does not seem to have any
          suspicion that he was only receiving a natural punishment for his indecision–an
          indecision which consisted in never being prepared to accept the consequences of his own
          theories. He was undecided in politics, undecided in religion. Writing, as an old man, of
          this time, he himself says: »My head was with Spinoza, though my whole heart remained with
          Paul and John;« and he hastens to provide his readers with those convincing proofs of the
          existence of God and the Holy Trinity which he had not been capable of perceiving in his
          youth.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">See <emph>Biographia Literaria</emph>.</note> After the appear<pb n="76"/>ance of about a dozen numbers, <emph>The Watchman</emph> had to be given
          up, and Coleridge took to writing for the newspapers. He began by attacking Pitt's
          Government, but in course of time, his opinions tending ever more in a conservative
          direction, he became its ardent supporter, and also, after the occupation of Switzerland
          by the French, an enemy of France. So hostile to that country were his articles in the
          <emph>Morning Post</emph>, that they even attracted the attention of Napoleon, and Coleridge became
          the object of the First Consul's special enmity. He would probably have been arrested
          during his residence in Italy, if he had not received timely warning from the Prussian
          ambassador, Wilhelm von Humboldt, and, through an inferior official, from Napoleon's own
          uncle, Cardinal Fesch.</p>

        <p>The year 1797, in the course of which Coleridge became acquainted with Wordsworth, was,
          as regards his poetry, the most important in his life; for it was in this year that he
          wrote his famous ballad, <emph>The Ancient Mariner</emph>, and <emph>Christabel</emph>, the fragment which marks
          a new era in English poetry.</p>

        <p><emph>Christabel</emph> was planned as the first of a series of poetical romances, the remainder of
          which never came into being. It is, without doubt, the first English poem which is
          permeated by the genuine Romantic spirit; and the new cadences, the new theme, the new
          style of versification, the novelty generally, made a powerful impression on contemporary
          poets. The irregular and yet melodious metre appealed so strongly to Scott that he
          employed it in his first Romantic poem, <emph>The Lay of the Last Minstrel</emph>. He frankly
          confesses how much he owed to the beautiful and tantalising fragment, <emph>Christabel</emph>, which
          he, like the other poets of the period, made acquaintance with in manuscript; for
          Coleridge read it aloud in social gatherings for twenty years before it saw the light as
          public property. Byron, too, heard it first on one of these occasions. Before hearing it
          he had, in one of his longer poems (<emph>The Siege of Corinth</emph>, xix.), written some lines
          which were not unlike some in <emph>Christabel</emph>. To these lines he, on a future occasion,
          appended a note in which he praises Coleridge's »wild and singularly original and
          beautiful poem.« But we see from Moore's <emph>Life and Letters</emph> that there <pb n="77"/> were critics who
          refused the meed of admiration accorded to <emph>Christabel</emph> by Scott and Byron, and still more
          freely by Wordsworth. Jeffrey and Moore himself consider it affected (<emph>Memoirs</emph>, ii 101;
          iv. 48). Danish critics, thoroughly initiated into the mysteries of this style by Tieck
          and the brothers Schlegel, and by their own poet Ingemann, cannot possibly attach so much
          importance to this fragment. Its excessive naïveté and simplicity, the intentional
          childishness in style and tone, are to us what buns are to bakers' children. The chief
          merit of the poem, apart from its full-toned, sweet melody, lies in the peculiar power
          with which the nature of the wicked fairy is presented to us, the <emph>dæmonic</emph> element, which
          had never been present in such force in English literature before. We must, however,
          remember that, though the first part of the poem was written in 1797, the second was
          written and the first revised in 1800–that is to say, <emph>after</emph> Coleridge had travelled
          with Wordsworth in Germany, and there made acquaintance with contemporary German poetry,
          its medieval ground-work, and its latest tendency.</p>

        <p>Coleridge's one other poem of any length, <emph>The Ancient Mariner</emph>, which is even more
          artificially naïve in style than <emph>Christabel</emph>, and is provided, in the manner of the
          medieval ballads retailed in the little shops in back streets, with a prose index of
          contents on the margin of the pages, is now the most popular of all his poems, although it
          was fiercely attacked on its first appearance. On a very unnatural introduction (three
          guests on their way to a wedding are stopped, and one of them is led to forget his
          destination, so eloquent is the ancient mariner–»and on the street, too,« as Falstaff
          says) follows a story of all the horrors, ghostly and material, which ensue, because one
          of the sailors on a ship has been thoughtless enough to kill an albatross which had
          alighted on the rigging. The whole crew, with the exception of this one man, die, as a
          punishment for the act of inhospitality. Swinburne tells that, when the poem was new, the
          English critics were greatly occupied with the question whether its moral (that one should
          not shoot albatrosses) was not so preponderant that it destroyed the fantastic <pb n="78"/> effect of
          the poem; whilst others maintained that the defect of the poem was its want of a practical
          moral. Long afterwards the same matter formed the subject of a dispute between Freiligrath
          and Julian Schmidt. Modern criticism would willingly excuse the absence of any moral in
          the ballad if it could find a poetic central idea in it.</p>

        <p>A comparison may serve to show its chief shortcoming. In a collection of poems by the
          Austrian lyric poet, Moritz Hartmann, entitled <emph>Zeitlosen</emph>, there is to be found one
          which, although it does not profess to owe its origin to <emph>The Ancient Mariner</emph>, at first
          sight strikes the reader as being a direct imitation of it. The metrical form is the same,
          and in the theme there is a close resemblance. <emph>Der Camao</emph> is the title of the poem. The
          Camao, which answers to Coleridge's albatross, is a bird which, in the Middle Ages, was
          kept in every house in the Pyrenean Peninsula, and treated with a reverence which had its
          source in a widespread superstition. It was believed, namely, that this bird could not
          thrive in a house on which rested the stain of a wife's infidelity; it died if there was
          even the slightest spot on the honour of its master. Its beautiful cage generally hung in
          the entrance chamber. In Hartmann's poem the old, deranged man who answers to Coleridge's
          demented mariner, tells how he, as a page, was seized with a violent passion for his
          master's wife, and how, every time he rushed from her presence, in despair at her coldness
          and displeasure, he was tortured as he left her apartments by the bird's song in honour of
          the chastity of the lady to whom it owed its life. The master of the house returns from
          the war bringing with him his friend, a handsome young minstrel and hero, whom the lady
          honours with her friendship, and who is, in consequence, soon hated by the jealous page.
          Quite beside himself, the young man denounces the lady and her friend to his master; but
          the latter calmly answers that Camao is still alive, and at that moment singing in his
          mistress's honour. In his jealous, vindictive rage the page kills the bird; Vasco kills
          his wife; and thenceforward the criminal wanders, demented and restless, from country to
          country, seeking rest, but finding it nowhere.</p>

        <p><pb n="79"/> As regards virtuosity and originality in the matter of diction, <emph>Der Camao</emph> is not for a
          moment to be compared with <emph>The Ancient Mariner</emph>; but as regards the poetic central idea,
          the German poem is not only much superior to its English model, but is in itself a
          complete, satisfactory criticism of Coleridge's ballad and all the artificial English
          theories which it represents. In <emph>Der Camao</emph> the slaughter of the bird is a real human
          action performed with a real human motive; the punishment is not a caprice, but a just and
          natural consequence of the misdeed. The misfortune which the killing of the bird brings to
          Vasco and his wife has a natural cause and effect connection with that deed, whilst the
          death of the whole ship's crew, as the result of the cruelty shown to the albatross, is
          folly. The comparison assists us to a clear understanding of the difference between a true
          poetical conception of the superstitious idea and a Romantic treatment of it. The story in
          both poems is founded on a superstition. Hartmann has no desire to submit the superstition
          to the criticism of reason; but he forces it upon no one; the beauty of his poem is quite
          independent of the belief or disbelief of his reader in the miraculous susceptibility of
          the Camao. Romantic extravagance, on the other hand, proclaims reverence for the
          marvellous and inexplicable to be the sum and substance of all wisdom and of all
          poetry.</p>

        <p>But though <emph>The Ancient Mariner</emph> may not take a high place when compared with poetry
          which has extricated itself from Romantic swaddling-bands, it stands high above most of
          the kindred productions of German Romanticism. In spite of all its Romantic
          fictitiousness, it breathes of the sea, the real, natural sea, whose changing moods and
          whose terrifying, menacing immensity it describes. The fresh breeze, the seething foam,
          the horrible fog, and the hot, copper-coloured evening sky with its blood-red sun–all
          these elements are nature's own; and the misery of the men tossing helplessly on the
          ocean, the starvation, the burning thirst that drives them to suck the blood from their
          own arms, the pallid countenances, the terrible death-rattle, the horrible
          putrefaction–all these elements are realities, represented with English realistic
          force.</p>

        <p><pb n="80"/> And it is a very English trait that Coleridge himself should have been thoroughly capable
          of seeing the weak points of such a poem as his own famous ballad. The national quality of
          humour assisted him to this independence of judgment. We have the following anecdote from
          his own pen. »An amateur performer in verse expressed a strong desire to be introduced to
          me, but hesitated in accepting my friend's immediate offer, on the score that he was, he
          must acknowledge, the author of a confounded severe epigram on my <emph>Ancient Mariner</emph>, which
          had given me great pain. I assured my friend that if the epigram was a good one, it would
          only increase my desire to become acquainted with the author, and begged to hear it
          recited, when, to my no less surprise than amusement, it proved to be one which I had
          myself inserted in the <emph>Morning Post</emph>.« When Coleridge tells us, too, that he himself
          wrote three sonnets expressly for the purpose of exciting a good-natured laugh at the
          artificial simplicity and doleful egotism of the new poetical tendency, and that he took
          the elaborate and swelling language and imagery of these sonnets from his own poems, we
          cannot deny that his endeavours to keep free from the entanglement in theories which was
          the weak point in German Romanticism, bespeak rare intellectual superiority.</p>

        <p>It was, nevertheless, from Germany that Coleridge's intellect received its most
          invigorating and essential nourishment. He was the first Englishman who penetrated into
          the forest of German literature, which was as yet unexplored by foreigners; he made his
          way into it about the same time as Madame de Staël, the pioneer of the Latin races. Whilst
          he was producing the famous poems just described, he began the study of German. Schiller
          and Kant attracted him first. In 1798 he and Wordsworth went to Germany on a literary
          voyage of discovery. In Hamburg they visited the patriarch Klopstock, who praised Bürger
          to them, but spoke coldly and disparagingly of the rest of the younger literary men, and
          especially of Coleridge's idols, Kant and Schiller. The latter's <emph>Die Räuber</emph> he professed
          himself unable to read. But he had plenty to say on the subject of <emph>The <pb n="81"/> Messiah</emph> and his
          extreme satisfaction with the English translations of it. While in Germany, Coleridge
          studied the Gothic language, and read the Meistersingers and Hans Sachs; and on his return
          he published a translation of Schiller's <emph>Wallenstein</emph>, the play which Benjamin Constant
          was soon afterwards to adapt for the French stage.</p>

        <p>It was about this time that Coleridge settled in the <emph>Lake</emph> district, where Wordsworth
          and Southey had already taken up their abode–the district which gave its name to the
          literary school constituted, as their contemporaries chose to consider, by these three
          poets. The name, as a matter of fact, does not mean much more than if, in Denmark in 1830,
          Hauch, Ingemann, Wilster, and Peder Hjort, had been dubbed Sorists. The English poets of
          the Lake School were quite as unlike each other in their gifts as were these Sorö
          professors.<!-- [3] --> But the criticism of the day always coupled Coleridge's name with
          Wordsworth's and Southey's because it was known that he was on intimate and friendly terms
          with them, because he never missed an opportunity of praising them, nor they of praising
          him, and because he and the other Lakists were crowned every three months with fresh
          laurels in the <emph>Quarterly Review</emph>, whilst the sinner Byron was chastised with fresh
          scorpions. Though Coleridge published almost nothing, Wordsworth and Southey were hardly
          ever under the cascade of criticism without some drops of it falling upon him. The
          circumstance that the Lake poets aimed (in much the same manner as the Pre-Raphaelite and
          the Nazarene painters) at poetic intensity, a childlike disposition and a childlike faith,
          pious blandness and priestly unction, exposed the man who could not but be regarded as the
          teacher of the school to much satire and derision. As a youth, in his poem <emph>Fire, Famine,
          and Slaughter</emph>, Coleridge had made all the horrors, one by one, reply to the question: Who
          bid you rage? with the following refrain, applying to Pitt:–</p>


        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Who bade you do't?</l>
          <l>The same! the same!</l>
          <l>Letters four do form his name.</l>
          <l>He let me loose, and cried Halloo!</l>
          <l>To him alone the praise is due.«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>


        <p><pb n="82"/> Now he was Mr. Pitt's journalistic henchman, and, like all the other members of the Lake
          School, a strict Tory, the enemy of liberal opinions in everything relating to church and
          state. What wonder that he was classed along with the others in the constant party attacks
          made by the Liberals! And yet it would have been so easy and so natural to distinguish him
          as a poet from all the others, and to pay him the honour which was due to his originality.
          The few poems which he wrote in the course of a comparatively long life are distinguished
          by the exquisite melodiousness of their language; their harmonies are not only delicate
          and insinuating like Shelley's, but contrapuntally constructed and rich; they have a
          peculiar, ponderous sweetness; each line has the taste and weight of a drop of honey. In
          poems such as <emph>Love</emph> and <emph>Lewti</emph>, which are the two sweetest, and in an Oriental fantasy
          like <emph>Kubla Khan</emph>, which was inspired by a dream, we hear Coleridge flute and pipe and
          sing with all the changing cadences of the most exquisite nightingale voice. It is
          Swinburne who makes the apt remark that, in the matter of harmonies, Shelley is, compared
          with Coleridge, what a lark is compared with a nightingale.</p>

        <p>But Coleridge's poetry is as unplastic as it is melodious, and as unimpassioned as it is
          mellifluous. It is of the fantastic Romantic order; that is to say, it neither expresses
          strong, personally experienced emotions, nor reproduces what the author has observed in
          the surrounding world. In this last connection it is interesting to know that Coleridge's
          long tour in the south was altogether without results as far as his poetry was concerned.
          The only poem he brought home with him, the <emph>Hymn Before Sunrise in the Vale of Chamouni</emph>,
          a valley in which he never set foot, was composed with the assistance of the description
          of the locality given by the well-known Danish authoress, Friederike Brun. His historic
          sense was as defective as his sense of locality. He says himself: »Dear Sir Walter Scott
          and myself are exact, but harmonious opposites in this–that every old ruin, hill, river,
          or tree called up in his mind a host of historical or biographical associations ...
          whereas for myself, I believe I should walk on the <pb n="83"/> plain of Marathon without taking more
          interest in it than in any other plain of similar features.... Charles Lamb wrote an essay
          on a man who lived in past time:–I thought of adding another to it on one who lived not
          <emph>in time</emph> at all, past, present, or future–but beside or collaterally.«<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom"><emph>Specimens of the Table Talk of the Late Samuel T. Coleridge</emph>, ii 225.</note> His poetry is,
          thence, in the literal sense of the word, visionary; the poem which the best critics
          consider the finest, he composed in a dream.</p>

        <p>In his own life there was as little of will and plan as in a dream. Somewhat indolent by
          nature, he became more and more procrastinating as years went on; and the result of his
          procrastination was an accumulation of difficulties which he had not energy and
          application enough to overcome. To relieve physical suffering he had recourse to opium,
          and soon became a confirmed opium-eater, thereby increasing his incapacity to carry out
          any plan. After a period of wandering, living first in one, then in another friend's
          house, and either writing for magazines or giving lectures on the history of literature,
          he decided that he was unfit to manage himself and his affairs, and from 1816 onwards he
          lived at Highgate in the house and under the control of a doctor named Gillman–separated
          from his own family, whom he left to the care of his friend and brother-in-law,
          Southey.</p>

        <p>On the indulgence in opium followed remorse and self-reproach and increasingly orthodox
          piety. Most of what Coleridge now wrote was written with the object of refuting the
          heresies of his youth and defending the doctrine of the Trinity and the Church of England
          against all attacks.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">»On the Constitution of Church and State according to the Ideal of Each«: <emph>Lay
            Sermons</emph>.</note> Emerson, who paid him a visit, describes him as »old and
          preoccupied«; enraged by the effrontery with which a handful of Priestleians dared to
          attack the doctrine of the Trinity propounded by Paul and accepted unchallenged for
          centuries; and falling in his talk into all manner of commonplaces. Eighteen years passed,
          spent in dreaming, talking, and composing edifying essays. His influence during this <pb n="84"/> period was due much less to his productive power than to the manner in which he incited to
          production. He stimulated and goaded others to the pitch of expressing themselves
          publicly. Residing close to London, and constantly visited, because of his conversational
          powers, by the best writers of the day–Charles Lamb, Wordsworth, Southey, Leigh Hunt,
          Hazlitt, Carlyle–he was a looker-on on life during the years when the great
          representatives of the opposite intellectual tendency to his, Shelley and Byron, were
          pouring forth their fiery denunciations of the order of society and state which he
          considered so excellent. Without will of his own, under control, and himself protected
          like a child, Coleridge became ever more and more the would-be protector of society,
          whilst the two great poets of liberty, banished from their homes and thrown entirely on
          their own resources, developed an independence unexampled in the history of literature,
          and, protected neither by themselves nor any one else, were shattered long before their
          time by the ardour of conflict. The right of personal investigation and personal liberty
          were as precious treasures to them as the Church of England was to Coleridge.</p>

        <head type="add">8. The Lake School's Conception of Liberty</head>
        <head><pb n="[85]"/> VIII. THE LAKE SCHOOL'S CONCEPTION OF LIBERTY</head>

        <p>Coleridge and the other members of the Lake School would never have dreamt of calling
          themselves anything but warm friends of liberty; the days were past when the reactionaries
          called themselves by another name. Coleridge wrote one of his most beautiful poems, the
          <emph>Ode to France</emph>, in the form of a hymn to liberty, to his constant love for which he calls
          clouds, waves, and forests to testify; and Wordsworth, who dedicated two long series of
          his poems to liberty, regarded himself as her acknowledged champion. A cursory glance at
          the works of these poets might well leave us with the impression that they were as true
          lovers of liberty as Moore, or Shelley, or Byron. But the word liberty in their mouths
          meant something different from what it did in Moore's, or Shelley's, or Byron's. To
          understand this we must dissect the word by means of two simple questions: freedom, from
          what?–liberty, to do what?</p>

        <p>To these conservative poets freedom is a perfectly definite thing, a right which England
          has and the other countries of Europe have not–the right of a country to govern itself,
          un-tyrannised over by an autocratic ruler of foreign extraction. The country which has
          this privilege is free. By liberty, then, the men in question understood freedom from
          foreign political tyranny; there is no thought of liberty of action in their conception at
          all. Look through Wordsworth's <emph>Sonnets Dedicated to Liberty</emph>, and see what it is they
          celebrate. It is the struggle of the different nations against Napoleon, who is described
          as a species of Antichrist. (Scott calls him »the Devil on his burning throne.«)</p>

        <p>The poet mourns the conquest of Spain, Switzerland, Venice, the Tyrol, by the French; he
          chants the praises <pb n="86"/> of Hofer, the undaunted, of brave Schill, and daring Toussaint
          L'Ouverture, the men who ventured to face the fierce conquerors; and he sings with quite
          as great admiration of the King of Sweden, who with romantically chivalrous folly threw
          down the gauntlet to Napoleon, and proclaimed his longing for the restoration of the
          Bourbons. (Ere long Victor Hugo and Lamartine, in their character of supporters of the
          Legitimist monarchy, followed suit in singing the praises of the Swedish king and his son,
          Prince Gustavus Vasa.) Hatred of Napoleon becomes aversion for France. In one of the
          sonnets (»Inland, within a hollow vale, I stood«) Wordsworth tells how the »barrier flood«
          between England and France for a moment seemed to him to have dwindled to the dimensions
          of a river, and how he shrank from the thought of »the frightful neighbourhood«; in
          another he rejoices in the remembrance of the great men and great books England has
          produced, and remarks that France has brought forth »no single volume paramount ... no
          master spirit,« that with her there is »equally a want of books and men.«</p>

        <p>He always comes back to England. His sonnets are one long declaration of love to the
          country for which he feels »as a lover or a child,« the country of which he writes:
          »Earth's best hopes are all with thee.« He follows her through her long war, celebrating,
          like Southey, each of her victories; and it is significant of his attitude that, appended
          to the <emph>Sonnets Dedicated to Liberty</emph>, we find the great, pompous thanksgiving ode for the
          battle of Waterloo. We of to-day ask what kind of liberty it was that Waterloo gained; but
          we know full well that the group of poets whose heroes were the national heroes–Pitt,
          Nelson, and Wellington, and who sang the praises of the English constitution as being in
          itself liberty, and lauded England as the model nation, won a degree of favour with the
          majority of their countrymen to which their great poetic antagonists have not even yet
          attained. Wordsworth and his school considered the nation ideal as it was, whereas the
          others tried to compel it to turn its eyes towards an ideal, not only unattained, but as
          yet unrecognised; the former flattered it, and were rewarded with laurels; the latter
          educated and castigated it, and were <pb n="87"/> spurned by it. Scott was offered the post of Poet
          Laureate, and Southey and Wordsworth in turn occupied it; but to this day the English
          nation has shown no public recognition of what it owes to Shelley and Byron.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">This year (1875) Disraeli, as Chairman of the Byron Memorial Committee, has started a
            subscription for the erection of a statue to Byron on some prominent site in London.</note> And the
          reason is, that these men's conception of liberty was utterly different from that of the
          Lake School. To them it was not realised in a nation or a constitution–for it was no
          accomplished, finished thing; neither was their idea of the struggle for liberty realised
          in a highly egoistic war against a revolutionary conqueror. They felt strongly what an
          absence of liberty, political as well as intellectual, religious as well as social, there
          might be under a so-called <emph>free</emph> constitution. They had no inclination to write poems in
          honour of the glorious attainments of the human race, and more especially of their own
          countrymen; for in the so-called land of freedom they felt a terrible, oppressive want of
          freedom–of liberty to think without consideration of recognised dogmas, to write without
          paying homage to public opinion, to act as it was natural to men of their character to
          act, without injury from the verdict of those who, because they had no particular
          character of their own, were the most clamorous and unmerciful condemners of the faults
          which accompanied independence, originality, and genius. They saw that in this »free«
          country the ruling caste canted and lied, extorted and plundered, curbed and constrained
          quite as much as did the one great autocrat with his absolute power–and without his
          excuse, the authority of intellect and of genius.</p>

        <p>To the poets of the Lake School, coercion was not coercion when it was <emph>English</emph>, tyranny
          was not tyranny when it was practised under a <emph>constitutional monarchy</emph>, hostility to
          enlightenment was not hostility to enlightenment when it was displayed by a <emph>Protestant</emph>
          church. The Radical poets called coercion coercion, even when it proceeded to action with
          the English flag flying and the arms of England as its policemen's badge; they cherished
          towards monarchs generally, the objection of the Lake School poets to absolute monarchs;
          they desired <pb n="88"/>to free the world not only from the dominion of the Roman Catholic
          priesthood, but from priestly tutelage of every description. When they heard poets of the
          other school, who in the ardour of youth had been as progressive as themselves, extolling
          the Tory Government of England with the fervour which distinguishes renegades, they could
          not but regard them as enemies of liberty. Therefore it is that Shelley, in his sonnet to
          Wordsworth, writes:–</p>


        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»In honoured poverty thy voice did weave</l>
          <l>Songs consecrate to truth and liberty.</l>
          <l>Deserting these, thou leavest me to grieve,</l>
          <l>Thus having been, that thou shouldst cease to be.«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>


        <p>Therefore it is that Byron is tempted again and again »to cut up Southey like a gourd.«
          And therefore it is that the love of liberty of the Radical poets is a divine frenzy, a
          sacred fire, of which not a spark is to be found in the Platonic love of the Lake School.
          When Shelley sings to liberty:–</p>


        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»But keener thy gaze than the lightning's glare,</l>
          <l>And swifter thy step than the earthquake's tramp;</l>
          <l>Thou deafenest the rage of the ocean; thy stare</l>
          <l>Makes blind the volcanoes; the sun's bright lamp</l>
          <l>To thine is a fen-fire damp;«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>


        <p>we feel that this liberty is not a thing which we can grasp with our hands, or confer as
          a gift in a constitution, or inscribe among the articles of a state-church. It is the
          eternal cry of the human spirit, its never-ending requirement of itself; it is the spark
          of heavenly fire which Prometheus placed in the human heart when he formed it, and which
          it has been the work of the greatest among men to fan into the flame that is the source of
          all light and all warmth in those who feel that life would be dark as the grave and cold
          as stone without it. This liberty makes its appearance in each new century with a new
          name. In the Middle Ages it was persecuted and stamped out under the name of heresy; in
          the sixteenth century it was championed and opposed under the name of the Reformation; in
          the seventeenth it was sentenced to the stake as witchcraft and atheism; in the <pb n="89"/> eighteenth
          it became first a philosophical gospel, and then, through the Revolution, a political
          power; in the nineteenth it receives from the champions of the past the new nickname of
          Radicalism.</p>

        <p>What the poets of the Lake School extolled was a definite, actually existing <emph>sum of
          liberties</emph>–not liberty. What the revolutionary poets extolled was undoubtedly true
          liberty; but their conception was so extremely ideal, that in practical matters they too
          often shot beyond the mark. In the weakening of all established government they saw only
          the weakening of bad government; in the half-barbaric revolts of oppressed races they saw
          the dawn of perfect liberty. Shelley had so little knowledge of his fellow-men that he
          thought the great victory would be won if he could exterminate kings and priests at a
          blow; and Byron's life was almost over before he learned by experience how few republican
          virtues the European revolutionists leagued together in the name of liberty possessed. The
          poets of the Lake School were safeguarded against the generous delusions and overhastiness
          of the Radical poets; but posterity has derived more pleasure and profit from the
          aberrations due to the love of liberty in the latter than from the carefully hedged in and
          limited Liberalism of the former.</p>

        <p>This is the time to notice the man who was Byron's and Shelley's worst enemy and
          Coleridge's best friend, and who, inferior as his productions are to those of his friend,
          deserves also to have his name coupled with Coleridge's as a famous English
          Romanticist.</p>

        <p>Robert Southey, born in Bristol in 1774, was the son of a linen-draper there, and to the
          end of his life a man who produced the impression that he had been born in narrow
          circumstances, in a corner of the world with a narrow spiritual horizon. After studying a
          short time at Oxford, he, like the other poets of the Lake School, became infected by the
          spirit of the Revolution. In 1794 he wrote an extremely Jacobinical poem, <emph>Wat Tyler</emph>.
          About the same time he composed the following inscription for the room in which Martin,
          the regicide, had been confined:–</p>

        <p>After Southey, too, had given up his project of emigration and won the hand of <emph>his</emph> Miss
          Fricker, he settled in London, in 1797. From 1807 onwards the Government granted him an
          annual allowance of £150, and after Pye's death he became Poet Laureate, with a salary of
          £300. This post, which entailed the obligation to compose a poem on the occasion of every
          special event in the royal family, had first been offered by the Prince Regent to Scott,
          who asked his friend and patron, the Duke of Buccleuch, for advice in the matter. The Duke
          wrote: »Only think of being chanted and recitatived by a parcel of hoarse and squeaking
          choristers on a birthday, for the edification of the bishops, pages, maids of honour, and
          gentlemen-pensioners! Oh horrible! thrice horrible!« &amp;c., &amp;c. Scott declined the
          proffered honour, and suggested Southey, a loyal and needy poet, as a fit recipient. For
          the greater part of his life Southey was obliged to live by his pen, and consequently
          often wrote under compulsion. Industrious, economical, a model of all the domestic
          virtues, he amassed a capital of £12,000. With him, as with the Germans, Romanticism,
          instead of precluding the bourgeois virtues, throve along with them. It had, after all, so
          little connection with real life. His respectable Philistinism did not forbid of his
          allowing his imagination to take the wildest Oriental flights.</p>

        <p>During the first, the liberal-minded, stage of Southey's <pb n="92"/> career, we are conscious of a
          sympathetic ardour in his writing. He possessed both enthusiasm and courage. His epic,
          <emph>Joan of Arc</emph>, published in 1797, is a poem inspired by as fervent an admiration for the
          heroine of France as that displayed by Schiller five years later in his <emph>Jungfrau von
          Orleans</emph>. Southey's work is, like Schiller's, of an exactly opposite character to
          Voltaire's <emph>Pucelle</emph>, which, the English poet in his preface informs his readers, is a
          book he has »never been guilty of looking into.« In <emph>Joan of Arc</emph> Southey is not yet the
          Romanticist. Once or twice he projects his vision as far as his own day. In the Third Book
          he extols Madame Roland as »the martyred patriot,« in the Tenth he refers to Lafayette's
          as »the name that Freedom still shall love.« And in his representation of Jeanne's
          exploits we have not, as in Schiller, any reference to witchcraft. At a decisive moment,
          when the Maid is being questioned as to her beliefs, she (and through her, her poet) makes
          such a frank confession of her faith in nature that we feel satisfied that in Southey's
          case too, the Naturalism which dominates the English poetry of the day is the foundation
          upon which everything rests.</p>

        <p>In this little harangue the attentive reader is conscious, not only of the echo of the
          revolutionary cries on the other side of the Channel, repeated in the language of English
          nature-worship, but also of the young poet's want of ability to give his subject the
          proper local colouring or to impart to it the spirit of the age. France and the Middle
          Ages are to him here what the East and the world of legend were to become–a costume in
          which his English and Protestant ideas figure. Of one thing, however, there is no doubt,
          namely, that it required courage to sing the praises of the French national heroine at a
          moment when the animosity to France was so strong; and the poem, in spite of its aridity
          both as regards feeling and colour, is a work which does honour to a young poet. But the
          brave spirit which elevated his talent was soon to disappear from his writings.</p>

        <p><pb n="94"/> The lower the flood of unselfish enthusiasm for the great tasks and dreams of humanity
          ebbed in Southey's soul, the stronger became the impulse to remedy the aridity by pouring
          in a stream of purely external Romanticism. He had by degrees attained to a certain
          mastery over the resources of language, had acquired the art of writing loosely
          constructed but melodious verse, expressive in spite of its vagueness and monotony.
          Employing this melodious, flexible metre in the representation of the superstitions of
          Arabia and the most fantastic dreams of the Oriental races, he now produced his two
          principal works, <emph>The Curse of Kehama</emph> and <emph>Thalaba the Destroyer</emph>. The Oriental tendency
          is common to Romanticism in every country. Oehlenschläger, the Dane, displays it
          simultaneously with Southey; it reaches France a little later, when Victor Hugo writes
          <emph>Aly et Gulhyndi</emph> and <emph>Les Orientales</emph>. But in the case of the English poets, the
          colourless, Protestant life of their own country, with its severe, cold propriety, must
          have invested the East with a peculiarly attractive charm. It required an Irishman,
          however–Thomas Moore, a colourist with Celtic blood in his veins–to arrive at anything
          resembling an understanding of a race like the ancient Persians and of their legends, and
          to reproduce the nature of the East in a style loaded with jewels and barbaric ornaments.
          <emph>Lalla Rookh</emph> is no masterpiece; its personages and ideas are far too European and tame;
          but <emph>Thalaba</emph>, a work which enjoyed a certain amount of celebrity in its day, is tame in
          comparison with <emph>Lalla Rookh</emph>, and as moral as an English sermon. It suffers from the
          sharp contrast between the gaudy tinsel of the scenery and the sober modesty of the
          feelings represented. We are transplanted into a world which is not less marvellous than
          that of the <emph>Thousand and One Nights</emph>, but a world in which, nevertheless, love of our
          fellow-men and faith in one God are perpetually inculcated. The hero's life is presided
          over by the most special providence. When the fit time has arrived for him to leave his
          foster-father's house, the flight of a swarm of Syrian grasshoppers, pursued by a flock of
          birds, is directed so as to pass above the house. A grass<pb n="95"/>hopper which one of the birds
          drops from its bill bears on its forehead in minute letters the inscription:–</p>


        <cit><quote><lg>

          <l>Son of Hodeirah, depart!«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>
        

        <p>But even though the poet employs such miraculous machinery as this, he can no more
          refrain here than he did in <emph>Joan of Arc</emph> from safeguarding his reader against the
          erroneous religious ideas of the period and the country. All his chief characters are
          rationalists in so far as their Oriental religion is concerned, and do not fall far short
          of being good Protestants. When the swarm of grasshoppers comes, Thalaba's foster-father,
          Moath, says:–</p>


        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Deemest thou</l>

          <l>Which fool the multitude, hath led them here</l>
          <l>From far Khorassan? Allah who appoints</l>
          <l>Yon swarms to be a punishment of man,</l>
          <l>These also hath he doomed to meet their way.«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>

        <p>A pure-bred Arabian could not well view things in a more rationalistic light than this.
          And we have the same sort of thing throughout. Southey piles up fantastic edifices, only
          to topple them over with the help of some Gospel text when he is tired of them, or thinks
          that his reader requires an admonition.</p>

        <p>Upon his finger Thalaba wears a ring which is a talisman against evil spirits. One day
          the evil spirit, Lobaba, who is determined to rob him of it, tries to draw it off his
          finger while he is asleep. But one of the good genii sends a wasp which stings Thalaba's
          finger close to the edge of the ring, making it impossible for the evil one to slip the
          ring over the swollen part. All Lobaba's plans are defeated in some such manner. At last
          the dread sorcerer, Mohareb, succeeds in ensnaring the youth. After Thalaba has defeated
          Mohareb repeatedly, the latter jeers at him because he defeats his enemies, not in open
          conflict, but with the aid of a talisman. He barbs his jeers so successfully that at last
          Thalaba casts the ring into an abyss. Then the struggle begins anew. <pb n="96"/> We expect that
          Thalaba, now defenceless against the supernatural power of his foes, will be overcome. Not
          at all! He conquers. How, and why? A voice from heaven informs us. The ring was not the
          true talisman: »The Talisman is Faith!« Why, then, all the machinery?</p>

        <p>The poet conducts us into subterranean caves, where human heads have to be thrown to the
          serpents who guard the entrances, where the taper can only be carried in the hewn-off hand
          of a hanged murderer, &amp;c, &amp;c.–in short, into a world which has no points of
          resemblance with Great Britain. But the whole is nothing but a ballet; the scene suddenly
          changes; the Oriental garments and trappings vanish, and the prompter reads aloud one of
          the Thirty-nine Articles. After this the ballet begins again. The scene represents a
          banquet, with costly dishes, with delicious wines in golden goblets–»ruby and amber, rosy
          as rising morn, or softer gleam of saffron like the sunny evening mist.« But all these
          temptations are of no avail. Thalaba is far too good a Mussulman to allow himself to be
          led astray:–</p>


        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»But Thalaba took not the draught;</l>
          <l>For rightly he knew had the Prophet forbidden</l>

          <l>Nor did the urgent hosts</l>
          <l>Proffer a second time the liquid fire,</l>
          <l>When in the youth's strong eye they saw</l>

        <p>He might be a member of an English Total Abstinence society, this »Destroyer«–he will
          drink nothing but spring water; and along with it he eats water melons.</p>

        </lg></quote></cit>


        <p>But there is no cause for alarm. Thalaba is a determined adversary of the polygamy of his
          native country. Like a <pb n="97"/> young Englishman travelling abroad, he fortifies himself with the
          thought of the girl at home to whom he is engaged:–</p>

        
        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»And Thalaba, he gazed,</l>

          <l>The loose suggestions of the scene impure.</l>
          <l>Oneiza's image swam before his sight.</l>
          <l>His own Arabian maid.«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>

        <p>Thalaba was born in England about the time when Aladdin saw the light in Denmark. (<emph>The
          Curse of Kehama</emph> was published in 1810, <emph>Aladdin</emph> in 1804, Thalaba in 1801.) What a
          cold-blooded animal he is compared with his Danish brother!</p>

        <p>He attains the object of his desire; he is married to his »own Arabian maid.« That
          everything may be thoroughly edifying and pious, the bride is made to die on the wedding
          night. To restore the Oriental character to the proceedings, Thalaba is compelled by his
          fate to kill an innocent young girl, named Laila. But that things may end in a
          satisfactorily Christian manner, his last recorded act is to forgive the sorcerer who has
          caused all his misfortunes–who proves to be the man he has been in search of all his life
          for the purpose of avenging the death of his father–and who is now unable to escape from
          him. In the course of a pompous funeral oration–</p>

        </lg></quote></cit>


        <p>Thalaba! you speak like a book–but like one of the books we open only to close
          again.</p>

        <p>Let us close <emph>Thalaba</emph>, then, and give a parting glance at its author. Even Thackeray,
          who cannot say enough in praise of Southey as a man, is obliged, in writing of his chief
          works, to allow the possibility that, in the struggle between Thalaba the Destroyer and
          the destroyer Time, the latter will remain master of the field. It would be interesting to
          know how many living Englishmen have read the poem. To our <pb n="98"/> own generation Southey's name
          is chiefly known, as it will be to posterity, by his hysteric assaults on Byron, and
          Byron's inimitable retorts. We have Southey's <emph>Vision of Judgment</emph> to thank for
          Byron's–and for this service we are ready to forgive him both the <emph>Curse of Kehama</emph> and
          <emph>Thalaba</emph>. We observe, however, in these poems, what is not to be observed in the works of
          the German Romanticists, namely, that the empty fantasticalness gives place to something
          better, when it is nature that is described. In the midst of all the Romantic confusion
          the Englishman's quiet realism asserts itself. Undeniably beautiful is the very first
          stanza of <emph>Thalaba</emph>, with its description of night in the desert, the sweet cadences of
          which the youthful Shelley imitated in his <emph>Queen Mab</emph>.</p>


        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»How beautiful is night!</l>
          <l>A dewy freshness fills the silent air;</l>
          <l>No mist obscures, nor cloud, nor speck, nor stain</l>
          <l>Breaks the serene of heaven.</l>
          <l>In full-orb'd glory yonder Moon divine</l> 
          <l>Rolls through the dark blue depths.</l>
          <l>Beneath her steady ray</l>
          <l>The desert-circle spreads,</l>
          <l>Like the round ocean, girdled with the sky.</l>
          <l>How beautiful is night!«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>


        <p>This rivals the description of moonlight falling on the desert sands given in The Caravan
          Song in the fifth act of <emph>Aladdin</emph>. And many such pictures are to be found in Southey's
          poems. When he describes the timid antelope, hearing the wanderers' steps, and standing,
          doubtful where to turn in the dim light; and the ostrich which, blindly hastening, meets
          them full; and the deep, moveless mist which mantles all (Book I v., Canto 19), we are
          aware that this is not scenery in the German Romantic style, but a picture of the East
          which is faithful to nature, a picture which we owe to the English habit of
          observation.</p>

        <p>It would be difficult to find another man of the same doubtful political and literary
          reputation whose friends and contemporaries have borne such high testimony to his personal
          character as did Southey's. He was Wordsworth's trusted friend; he was Coleridge's chief
          and most unwearied bene<pb n="99"/>factor; and, a fact which carries as much weight as any, Walter
          Savage Landor honoured him, in spite of their diametrically opposite political opinions,
          with a friendship which was only put an end to by death, and of which there are many
          reminiscences in Landor's <emph>Imaginary Conversations</emph>. On the 15th of May 1833, Emerson
          wrote: »I dined with Landor. He pestered me with Southey; but who is Southey?« So we see
          that Landor tried to make friends for his friend. And Thackeray, when in search of a
          typical English gentleman, did not hesitate to take as his model the poor, industrious,
          generously helpful Robert Southey.</p>

        <p>But no testimony in favour of Southey's personal character can clear his literary
          reputation. It is stained by his eulogies of the English royal family and his denunciation
          of Byron. That he, like the other members of the Lake School, should assume a cold and
          hostile attitude to this new and alarming literary phenomenon was natural. But that he,
          himself a poet, should inflame the educated mob against another poet, an infinitely
          greater one than himself, by a mean accusation of immorality and irreligion, is a crime
          which history cannot forgive, and which it punishes by recording Southey's name only in an
          appendix to Byron's life.</p>

        <p>At the time of the publication of <emph>Don Juan</emph>, Southey wrote:–»I am well aware that the
          public are peculiarly intolerant of literary innovations. Would that this literary
          intolerance were under the influence of a saner judgment, and regarded the morals more
          than the manners of a composition! Would that it were directed against these monstrous
          combinations of horrors and mockery, lewdness and impiety, with which English poetry has,
          in our days, first been polluted! For more than half a century English literature had been
          distinguished by its moral purity, the effect, and, in its turn, the cause of an
          improvement in national manners. A father might, without apprehension of evil, have put
          into the hands of his children any book which issued from the press, if it did not bear,
          either in its title-page or frontispiece, manifest signs that it was intended as furniture
          for the brothel. There was no danger in any work <pb n="100"/> which bore the name of a respectable
          publisher, or was to be procured at any respectable bookseller's. This was particularly
          the case with regard to our poetry. It is now no longer so; and woe to those by whom the
          offence cometh! The greater the talents of the offender, the greater is his guilt, and the
          more enduring will be his shame. Whether it be that the laws are in themselves unable to
          abate an evil of this magnitude, or whether it be that they are remissly administered, and
          with such injustice that the celebrity of an offender serves as a privilege whereby he
          obtains impunity, individuals are bound to consider that such pernicious works would
          neither be published nor written if they were discouraged as they might, and ought to be,
          by public feeling; every person, therefore, who purchases such books or admits them into
          his house promotes the mischief, and thereby, as far as in him lies, becomes an aider and
          abettor of the crime.</p>

        <p>It was necessary to give this long specimen of Southey's Biblical eloquence, because it
          is so typical of him and of men of his description; besides, every passionate outbreak of
          a strong party-spirit possesses historical interest. But Nemesis was not asleep. In 1821,
          the same year in which Southey discharged this volley of abuse, an unauthorised edition of
          his own old revolutionary work, <emph>Wat Tyler</emph>, was brought out by a bookseller who thought
          it might be a profitable speculation. Southey went to law, hoping to have the edition
          suppressed and the publisher punished. But Nemesis struck again, harder than before. Lord
          Eldon discharged the appeal, on the ground that it was illegal to grant any author right
          of property in works calculated to do injury to public morality! It was in this same year
          that Southey, on the occasion of the death of the old, deranged King, George III, wrote
          his long, dull <emph>Vision of Judgment</emph>, a poem in hexameters, which it is interesting (not
          only because of the resemblance in subject, but also because of the employment of the
          supernatural element in both) to compare with Victor Hugo's loyal poem, <emph>La Vision</emph>.
          Southey characteristically apotheosised poor old George III. on the ground of his
          possessing the virtues which were the only ones the poet himself understood–and, indeed,
          the only ones George did possess–the domestic and bourgeois virtues; he was a faithful
          husband, a kind father, &amp;c., qualities which no more make a man a good king than they
          make him a good poet. Byron could stand no more. The insulted Apollo rose in his wrath,
          seized the wretched Marsyas by the ear, and flayed him alive with merciless satire in his
          <emph>Vision of Judgment</emph>.</p>

        <p>Let us turn from Southey to a better man, to the author who, building on the groundwork
          of national character and history, originated the distinctively British type of
          Romanticism. This man did not, like his contemporaries of the Lake School, require to play
          the renegade in order to become conservative in religion and politics; he was conservative
          from his earliest youth, but without animosity to men of the opposite tendency.
          Pure-minded and gentle by nature, of a noble, resolute character, richly endowed with the
          creative gift, he for twenty years provided all the countries of Europe with wholesome,
          entertaining literature; and so original was his conception of race-character and history,
          that his influence in every civilised country upon the writing of history was not less
          great than his influence on fiction.</p>

        <p>Walter Scott, the ninth child of a family »of gentle blood,« was born in Edinburgh on the
          15th of August 1771. His father, a lawyer by profession, resembled Goethe's father in his
          severe sense of order; the old merchant in <emph>Rob Roy</emph> is said to be a portrait of him.
          Ardent loyalty, displaying itself in devotion, first to the Stuarts, then to the house of
          Hanover, was one hereditary quality in the family; and orthodox piety was another. In his
          earliest infancy Walter was healthy and strong, but in his second year he suddenly became
          lame in the right leg. The sweet temper with which throughout life he bore this physical
          infirmity, presents a remarkable contrast to the resentful impatience which his great
          English rival displayed with regard to a similar affliction. The boy grew up an ardent
          Jacobite and a lover of the old songs and ballads which tell of the Scottish wars and
          raids, Highland and Lowland. When he was little more <pb n="103"/> than an infant, he could repeat most
          of that ballad of Hardicanute with which in 1815 he drew tears from Byron's eyes. Anything
          of the nature of a story, especially if it was in rhyme, he learned with ease, but–a fact
          significant of the character of his future productions–dates and <emph>general principles</emph>
          were things which he assimilated with difficulty. The little lame boy, who rode about on a
          pony not much bigger than a Newfoundland dog, was an admirer of Percy's collection of old
          poems and fragments; and, what is more remarkable, himself collected old ballads and
          songs, as other children collect coins or seals. At the age of ten he had several volumes
          of them; and he continued to be a ballad-hunter all his life. Keen observation of his
          surroundings was another thing that developed early in Scott; he had an eye for every
          ruin, every monument of antiquity, every curious old stone; but he had not Wordsworth's
          intensity of regard for nature as simply nature; it was its historical and poetic interest
          that attracted him. A group of old trees which had grown together was not in itself
          capable of arousing in him the devotional spirit which it did in Wordsworth; but if he was
          told: Under this tree Charles II. rested; or: That tree was planted by Mary Queen of
          Scots–he broke a twig to keep in memory of his visit to the place, and never forgot these
          trees.</p>

        <p>[Illustration: SIR WALTER SCOTT]</p>

        <p>At the age of fifteen he made acquaintance with the picturesque Scottish Highlands, which
          were ere long to be of such importance to him, as providing his fictitious characters with
          a background of scenery as yet totally unknown to Europe. From the moment when he became
          conscious of his poetic calling, he studied nature in the manner of the painter who takes
          sketches. Before describing any district he took a special journey there, made a minute
          record of the appearance of the hills, of the lie and shape of the woods, even of the
          nature and outlines of the clouds at a given moment. He actually noted single flowers and
          bushes by the road-side or at the entrance to a cave. Though he had, in common with the
          Romanticists of Germany and Denmark, the poetic eye for nature, this did not stand in the
          way of vigorous, exact realism in description. <pb n="104"/> Whilst Oehlenschläger long contented
          himself with »speedwell« and roses, Scott, as he himself said, knew hill, brook, dell,
          rock, and stone, and the whole flora of his country.</p>

        <p>Before the young man's true vocation was revealed to him, he had made of himself a
          reliable, industrious lawyer, who engrossed his legal documents in the typical law hand in
          which he was afterwards to write so many famous books. In spite of his lameness he was
          healthy, active, and strong, and so well-trained in manly exercises that he was able to
          defend himself with his stick for a whole hour against three men who attacked him one day
          on a lonely road. It is of interest, in the case of such a man, to note the fact that this
          perfect health was not accompanied by any corresponding perfection of the sensual organs.
          Scott had hardly any sense of smell, and his Homeric appetite was the opposite of dainty;
          he never learned to distinguish good wine from bad, or well-cooked from badly-cooked
          food–in both of these points forming the antipodes of his younger contemporary, Keats.
          His feelings towards the other sex were so cold that his companions were always teasing
          him on the subject. Nevertheless he had, in his youth, a romantic attachment to a lady who
          chose another mate. Scott controlled his feelings so perfectly that no one suspected this
          attachment. He soon recovered from his disappointment, and, at the age of twenty-six, with
          a chaste, tranquil youth behind him, married Miss Carpenter, a lady of French Protestant
          family, whose father had died at the time of the Revolution. Most of the winter of
          1796-97, during which an invasion of Scotland by the French was expected, he spent in
          assisting to raise regiments of volunteers. In his enthusiasm he himself undertook the
          duties of quartermaster, paymaster, and secretary of one of these regiments.</p>

        <p>His first translations from the German have already been noticed. He had long been a
          living repertory of songs, ballads, and tales; in 1803 he published, under the title of
          <emph>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</emph>, a collection of ballads, which he dedicated to his
          native land, the »dearest half of Albion.« Part Third of this book, <emph>Modern Imitations</emph>,
          contains poems <pb n="105"/> by Scott himself.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">In the same year the Danish poet Oehlenschläger made his first appearance before the
            public, also with a collection of remodelled ballads. <emph>Digt</emph>, 1803.</note> In one of the criticisms of the day occurred the
          prophetic remark, that the book »contained the elements of a hundred historical
          romances.«</p>

        <p>With all his loyalty to the English royal family, Scott never felt himself anything but
          the thoroughbred Scotchman; indeed, there can be no doubt that what lies at the very root
          of his originality is his Scottish character. His strong interest in the poetry of history
          is a Scottish interest. One of the most pronounced characteristics of Scotchmen in every
          age has been an intense spirit of nationality. The phrase <emph>Perfervidum ingenium Scotorum</emph>,
          used centuries ago on the Continent to express the idea of the Scottish character then
          universally current, had originally no other meaning than this. If we for a moment
          overlook the many internal dissensions, which do not really undermine the feeling of
          community, we feel how difficult it would be to match in any other country the solidarity
          of this small nation placed on the frontier of one so much larger and more powerful, which
          speaks the same language. The Englishman, too, has an intense spirit of nationality, but
          it is much less salient and active; it is purely of a corroborative nature–corroboration
          of the claim advanced by his country to the possession of many and various attributes. The
          Scotchman's spirit of nationality is continuously active, constantly on the alert, because
          it is essentially of a negative character. When the Englishman says: I am an
          Englishman–he means exactly what he says; but when the Scotchman says or thinks: I am a
          Scotchman–it is tantamount to: I am not an Englishman.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Masson: <emph>Scottish Influence in British Literature</emph>.</note></p>

        <p>To understand this feeling properly, we must remember the smallness of the nation in
          comparison with its great neighbour. When we learn that in the year 1707 the entire
          population of Scotland did not exceed a million, we understand what concord, what
          determination, what defensive pugnacity, were imperative in the less numerous race if its
          individuality was not to be flooded out or stamped out by <pb n="106"/> the other. Thus it came about
          that bleak and rugged Scotland, as compared with verdant, fertile England, was the object
          of a very special love and admiration; its hills, its moors, its mists, inspired an almost
          martial patriotism. And it is therefore not surprising that, at the period when the spirit
          of nationality was breaking forth into poetry all over Europe, this country should produce
          a great descriptive, great narrative, poet–that it should be Scotland which brings forth
          the first and the most vigorous fruits of historical, ethnological Romanticism. What more
          natural than that an author in such a country as Scotland should be deeply interested in
          the peculiar customs of the Highlanders, and take pleasure in describing them in their
          picturesque garb! What more natural than that the man whose very name seemed to stamp him
          as a personification of his country, should endeavour, by recalling its great historical
          achievements in the past, to efface, as it were, the impression of its smallness and
          present insignificance!</p>

        <p>Scottish national feeling was, then, in the first instance, distinguished by its
          solidarity; the subordinate nation felt itself more one than the greater nation; there
          were fewer conflicting interests at work within it. Scott frequently describes this strong
          feeling of kinship among his countrymen–nowhere more beautifully than in the <emph>Heart of
          Midlothian</emph> the poor peasant heroine of which is encouraged by it to apply for help to the
          Duke of Argyle almost as if he were a relative. But Scottish national feeling possessed
          another distinguishing feature; being, in its character of attachment to an ancient; once
          entirely independent, state, itself a tradition, it was related to every other old
          tradition. This explains Scott's exaggerated reverence for royalty, its emblems and
          appurtenances. When he was a member of the Commission entrusted to institute a search
          after the ancient regalia of Scotland, the discovery of it filled him with such
          reverential emotion that, when one of the other Commissioners proposed to try the crown on
          a young lady's head, he could not help shouting: »By God, no!«</p>

        <p>The first great feeling of separate nationalism brought in its train a whole host of new
          separative feelings. If <pb n="107"/> there were not many nations that rivalled the Scotch in the way
          they held together as a people, there were still fewer that could show such inward
          division into parties and camps. The individual's feeling of his public duty did not begin
          with the nation, but with the tribe, the clan, nay, the family.</p>

        <p>Hence we find Scott, the true Scotchman, showing preference, as a ballad-writer, for the
          legends which treat of the exploits of his own ancestors or kin, and in his private life
          exhibiting strong family feeling. He was a model son and husband; he was, as his letters
          to his eldest son show, a devoted father; in the education of his children he neglected
          neither body nor soul–though his chief requirements of them seem to have been the ancient
          Persian ones, that they should ride well and speak the truth; but his conception even of
          these relations was not modern. In his private life as in his poetry, the family was more
          to him than the individual. He had a brother, Daniel by name, who fell into bad habits,
          and, though he never did anything actually dishonourable, was a disgrace to the family.
          Scott procured a small appointment in the West Indies for this brother, but in his
          correspondence about him never called him anything but »relation,« and also required of
          him that he should never divulge the nearness of the relationship. He refused to see
          Daniel when the latter returned to Scotland, never mentioned his name, and would neither
          attend his funeral nor wear mourning for him. Such behaviour as this shows the bad side of
          the society-preserving virtues. It is not surprising that the man who, with all his
          tender-heartedness, could sacrifice so much on the altar of »family,« was unable to become
          the poet of personality, and was stamped as of the past the moment Byron appeared.</p>

        <p>In 1802 the <emph>Edinburgh Review</emph> was founded. Scott was a contributor to it from the
          beginning. Its editor was his fellow-countryman, Jeffrey, a man whose critical
          pronouncements were regarded as of the utmost importance by the authors of the day, though
          his only gift as a critic was a kind of untrained, straightforward common-sense. Scott's
          contributions ceased in 1809, when, dissatisfied with the liberal-minded attitude assumed
          by the <emph>Edinburgh Review</emph> in the <pb n="108"/> Catholic question, and annoyed by Jeffrey's disparaging
          notice of <emph>Marmion</emph>, he founded the <emph>Quarterly Review</emph>.</p>

        <p>Scotts first narrative poem, <emph>The Lay of the Last Minstrel</emph>, appeared in 1805. It was a
          remarkable success. The reading public rejoiced at this return to nature and to national
          poetry. Pitt expressed the opinion that in several passages Scott had succeeded in
          producing the effect of a fine painting, and his opponent Fox was for once of the same
          opinion with him. Scott's personal amiability as Sheriff of Selkirkshire had, ere this,
          made him such a favourite that, as Wordsworth wrote in 1803, his name acted as <emph>an open
          sesame</emph> throughout the Border country; now he became equally beloved as a poet. In a very
          short time 30,000 copies of his work were sold. In it he introduced his readers, with
          something approaching historical accuracy, to the Scotland of the sixteenth century. The
          acceptance with which his descriptions of the Border customs were received, suggested the
          idea of writing something of the same kind in prose, an idea which in its embodiment
          received the name of <emph>Waverley</emph>. In the meantime interest had been aroused in the Middle
          Ages, chivalry, feudal conditions, and Scottish national characteristics generally.
          English tourists began to make romantic pilgrimages to the ruins of the old castles, and
          to the battle-field of Killiecrankie, where their countrymen had been defeated by the
          bare-legged, tartan-clad monsters.</p>

        <p>Until this time Scott had been in the habit of writing in the evening, and far on into
          the night; but after he devoted himself entirely to authorship, the early morning became
          his working time. He rose before five, went first to the stables to visit his horses and
          favourite dogs and other domestic animals, then seated himself at his desk and wrote so
          easily and fast that by the time the family assembled for breakfast, between nine and ten,
          he had, to use his own words, »broken the neck of the day's work.« He left his study at
          twelve, and spent the rest of the day with his family and his guests. Scott's works were,
          thus, written in the fresh morning hours, whilst Byron, characteristically enough, wrote
          his at night. And we seem, even when the two poets are likest <pb n="109"/> each other, to feel the
          influence of the bright, and the influence of the dark, hour of conception.</p>

        <p>It is in the poem which he began in November 1806, <emph>Marmion, a Tale of Flodden Field</emph>,
          that Scott is most like Byron. As far as the plot is concerned, this work is quite in
          Scott's usual style; the scene is laid in sixteenth-century Scotland, and it is the life
          of the castle and the court that is described. But the hero's character makes him an
          unmistakable forerunner of the Byronic heroes, and the whole poem is written in the
          easy-flowing, but somewhat monotonous, four-footed iambics which Byron employed in most of
          his poetical narratives. Marmion is a proud and brave, but also wicked knight. A young,
          beautiful nun, Constance of Beverley, whom he has abducted, follows him everywhere,
          disguised as a page; but he grows tired of her, and is determined to compel a young girl
          of high birth to marry him, though he knows that she loves another. In her jealous
          despair, Constance makes an attempt on Marmion's life; and he, indifferent and cruel,
          gives her up to the convent to suffer punishment as a runaway nun. The abbess pronounces
          sentence; and, in a Romantic scene of horror of the kind which Byron painted frequently,
          and with much less consideration for his readers' nerves, we see Constance immured alive
          in an underground vault.</p>

        <p>There is not much psychology in Scott's poem. The gorgeousness of the knight's armour,
          the gloom of the convent crypt, the architecture of the old castle, are of more importance
          to him than complicated emotions. Nevertheless he has given us in <emph>Marmion</emph> something very
          like a first sketch of <emph>The Giaour</emph> and of <emph>Lara</emph>. The Giaour's mistress suffers a
          terrible death; Lara's follows him everywhere, in the disguise of a page; and the scene in
          <emph>Marmion</emph>, in which the hero is publicly put to shame, has a certain resemblance to the
          scene in which Lara's past is brought to mind. Is there not something almost Byronic in
          the lines?–</p>

        <p>There is not merely a certain similarity between Marmion's and Lara's position and
          character; they also die in the same manner–fall on the battle-field, unyielding and
          ungodly to the last moment of their lives.</p>

        <p>But this is all the resemblance between them; and it is just sufficient to throw Byron's
          distinguishing characteristics into relief. To Scott, Marmion's personality is not the
          principal matter; he makes use of it for the purpose of grouping round it figures and
          incidents illustrative of his country's past; he requires the vices of his hero to set his
          simple tale going, but he is not the least absorbed in them, and describes them quite
          <emph>impersonally</emph>. When Byron, on the other hand, describes his earliest criminal heroes, his
          main object is to arouse interest in them. Their countenances attract the attention and
          interest of every one that sees them, and suggest pride, guilt, hatred, and defiance;
          never once in their lives are they, like Marmion, unable to look their <pb n="111"/> accusers in the
          face; they live the life of the fabulous scorpion, »around it flame, within it death.«
          Without hope in heaven, without solace upon earth, their hearts writhe in haughty agony
          until they cease to beat. Marmion was a stony-hearted, selfish knight, but his last
          thought and his last words were given to England; he is part of a greater whole than his
          own egoistic life. It is quite different with Byron's earliest heroes. They live entirely
          in their own inner life, which forms, as it were, a complete and separate world in itself;
          and the poet has been careful to allow the reader to catch sight of a similar dark,
          complete, and separate world in his, Byron's, soul. We catch a glimpse of his own <emph>Ego</emph>
          behind the fictitious one; we are conscious of a heart that has suffered, and that seeks
          relief in veiled confessions and mysterious outbursts: the manner of presentation is, in
          short, personal in the highest degree; and this means a revolution in English poetical
          art.</p>

        <p>The success of Scott's genuinely epic poem was not due to its hero, but to its events,
          and especially to the battle scenes in the last canto, which enthusiastic critics declared
          to be the finest out of Homer. And if the poem was well adapted to excite the admiration
          of Scott's sedate countrymen, it was not less adapted to please the court. Byron was right
          when he said to the Prince Regent that Scott struck him as being »more particularly the
          poet of <emph>Princes</emph>, as they never appeared more fascinating than in <emph>Marmion</emph> and <emph>The Lady
          of the Lake</emph>.« It is even probable that there are in <emph>Marmion</emph> direct allusions to the
          Prince Regent and his wife. The former can hardly have read unmoved the description of
          King James in his gorgeous court dress:–</p>

        <p>And the unfortunate, disgraced Princess of Wales, whose personal acquaintance Scott made
          when he was lionised in London for the first time, in 1806, and to whose party he, <pb n="112"/> as a
          Tory, belonged, may well have applied to her own case the poem's description of the
          forsaken Queen Margaret, who led such a lonely life whilst the chivalrous, dissolute
          monarch spent his time with his mistresses.</p>

        <p>Begun in 1806, <emph>Marmion</emph> was published in 1808, and when, in the following year, Scott
          for the second time visited London, he met with a reception that would have turned any
          other man's head. He played his part of lion with a good-nature and humour rare in a man
          who is the hero of the moment in a great metropolis. We read that once, after he had been
          entertaining a large company with his stories and quaint humour, when most of the guests
          had gone; leaving him with only a few intimate friends, he laughed at himself and quoted:
          »I know that I one Snug the joiner am–no lion fell.« And so modest was he that, when the
          conversation one day turned on himself in connection with Burns, he emphatically declared
          himself unworthy to be named on the same day as that great poet.</p>

        <p>But if Scott was a tame, gentle lion, he was a remarkably fierce Tory. The special
          purpose of his journey to London was the enlistment of contributors to the <emph>Quarterly
          Review</emph>. He desired that this periodical should be conducted on strictly Conservative
          principles, and he was especially firm on the subject of Catholic Emancipation. His theory
          was that if a particular sect of religionists are <emph>ipse facto</emph> connected with foreign
          politics and placed under the spiritual direction of a class of priests of unrivalled
          dexterity and activity, the state ought to be excused from entrusting them with
          confidential posts. »If a gentleman chooses to walk about with a couple of pounds of
          gunpowder in his pocket, if I give him the shelter of my roof, I may at least be permitted
          to exclude him from the seat next the fire.« Scott continued all his life to be of this
          opinion. Only a few years before his death, he said to his son-in-law: »I hold Popery to
          be such a mean and depraving superstition, that I am not sure I could have found myself
          liberal enough for voting the repeal of the penal laws as they existed before 1780. But
          now that you have taken the plaster off the old lady of Babylon's mouth, and given her
          free respiration, I cannot see the sense of <pb n="113"/> keeping up the irritation about the claim to
          sit in Parliament.« We understand in what need the English public stood of poets like
          Moore, like Byron and Shelley, when we hear a man of Scott's noble nature and culture
          express himself with such shameful and cruel narrow-mindedness.</p>

        <p>In 1810 appeared the <emph>The Lady of the Lake</emph>, a work which still further increased its
          author's popularity. The fresh breezes from the woods and hills which blow through this
          beautiful poem, its gentle ardour, its genuine feeling, which never becomes wild passion,
          its story, the effect of which is not, as so often with Wordsworth, destroyed by the
          introduction of charitable sentiments and religious exhortations–all this captivated the
          reading public. As a proof of the interest taken in the book, it may be mentioned that the
          receipts of the post-houses nearest the district where its scene is laid were doubled. To
          find a parallel incident we must again turn to the pages which tell the story of Scott's
          life. When <emph>Guy Mannering</emph>, of which 6000 copies were sold in two days, came out, it was
          reported that Scott had called Dandie Dinmont's two dogs, Pepper and Mustard, after two
          actually existing terriers, to which a Liddesdale farmer had given these odd names. This
          man, whose name was Davidson, and who was not really portrayed in the novel at all, became
          so famous that people took long journeys to see him; a lady of rank, who desired to
          possess a couple of dogs of the famous breed, but who did not know the farmer's name,
          addressed her letter to »Dandie Dinmont,« and it reached its proper destination.</p>

        <p><emph>The Lady of the Lake</emph> met with an almost equally cordial reception. We read that on the
          day when it reached Sir Adam Fergusson, a Scottish captain serving in Portugal, he was
          posted with his company on a point of ground exposed to the enemy's artillery. The men
          were ordered to lie prostrate on the ground, and while they kept that attitude, the
          captain, kneeling at their head, read aloud the description of the battle in Canto vi.,
          and the listening soldiers only interrupted him by a joyous huzza whenever the French shot
          struck the bank close above them.</p>

        <p>What the modern and foreign reader of this poem finds <pb n="114"/> in it now is, in the first place,
          strong national feeling; the memories of ancient days, of feudal customs, of Scottish
          royalty, of the clan's fidelity to its chief, are chanted in lucid, vivid, simple verse.
          Along with this, he finds descriptions of nature with the dew as fresh on them as on
          Christian Winther's. What he does not find is any attempt at psychological character
          portrayal. There is an old bard, Allan by name, and another Romantic old character, half
          Druid, half prophet, Brian by name; there are Romantic dreams which come true, and
          prophecies which are fulfilled. But these personages and incidents have their place in the
          poem because they belong to the period and the people, not because they are mysterious.
          There is not a trace to be found of the Romantic belief in horrors. For, much as Scott
          enjoyed hearing or writing anything of the nature of a ghost story, he was, unlike the
          German Romanticists, totally unimpressionable as regarded the mysteriously horrible. He
          tells somewhere that, having arrived one evening at a country inn, he was informed that
          there was no bed for him. »No place to lie down at all?« said he. »No,« said the people of
          the house, »none, except a room in which there is a corpse lying.« »Well,« said he, »did
          the person die of any contagious disorder?« »Oh no; not at all,« said they. »Well, then,«
          continued he, »let me have the other bed.« »So,« said Sir Walter, »I laid me down, and
          never had a better night's sleep in my life.«</p>

        <p>There is no want of freshness in the Romantic flavour of <emph>The Lady of the Lake</emph>; what
          really takes away from its attractiveness for us, nowadays, is the theatricalness of its
          representation of manners and customs. Scott has not succeeded in steering quite clear of
          this most perilous of reefs for the Romantic epic, the reef on which Southey suffered
          shipwreck. Take, for example, the description of the call of the clan to arms by the youth
          bearing the blood-stained cross. Everything is pushed to an extreme to produce the
          theatrical effect. The young man comes first to a house where funeral rites are being
          held, and forces the son to leave his father's corpse and his weeping mother; then he
          meets a wedding procession, and takes the bridegroom away from the bride. We seem to see
          the procession <pb n="115"/> crossing the stage, and to feel the impressive effect produced by the
          sudden appearance of the cross-bearer from behind the scenes. Things happen just as they
          do in the theatre: a loud whistle, and empty valleys are filled and bare heights covered
          with armed men–a wave of the hand, and they disappear again. They are <emph>general effects</emph>
          that we are conscious of; we feel that the poet is interested in the people, not in the
          individual. His first and chief aim was to represent in strong relief the beautiful
          traditional customs of his country: the stranger is welcomed in the hut without a question
          being asked–the combatant chivalrously shares his plaid with his exhausted antagonist.
          His second aim was to excite his reader pleasurably by means of surprises: Fitzjames's
          Highland guide suddenly makes himself known as the redoubted chief, Roderick
          Dhu–Fitzjames himself proves to be the King of Scotland. But how light and joyous and
          healthfully pure is the flow of this hymn of praise of Scotland and the Scotch! The King,
          high-spirited and honourable as one of Calderon's kings, masters his own passion; and the
          Highlanders and the Lowlanders, men and women, have their hearts in the right place. We
          enjoy the glimpse into the harmonious world, and do not miss Wordsworth's castigatory and
          admonitory psychology.</p>

        <p>We have a really interesting counterpart to <emph>The Lady of the Lake</emph> in Wordsworth's <emph>White
          Doe of Rylstone</emph>, a narrative poem founded on one of the ballads in Percy's collection,
          and also begun in 1809. It is in this work that the poet of Rydal Mount, who probably felt
          the spirit of rivalry stir within him, approaches nearest to Scott's peculiar domain. No
          one would dream of denying that the feeling in Wordsworth's poem is much deeper. His
          dislike of dazzling virtues and brilliant vices has led him to choose a hero who, although
          an obedient son and a valiant knight, refuses, from a sense of duty, to follow his father
          and his brother when they raise the standard of revolt against Queen Elizabeth of England,
          and who, misunderstood and repudiated, is obliged, without taking his share of the danger,
          to witness his kinsmen's defeat and ignominious punishment. Wordsworth has endowed this
          hero with self-abnegation, fortitude, generosity, and Christian <pb n="116"/> piety; but there is too
          much affectation of profundity in the poem, too much dragging in of the half-supernatural,
          too much sentimentality and unction. Scott viewed nature and the old customs with the eye
          of a lover of the chase, Wordsworth with the eye of the moralist. Wordsworth's ponderous
          cargo-boat ploughs its way heavily through the water; Scott's poet's skiff flies along
          with all sails set, leaving only light bubbles of fancy behind in the reader's memory; it
          is like the boat in the Third Canto of his poem, which flies so fast that</p>


        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»The bubbles where they launched the boat</l>
          <l>Were all unbroken and afloat,</l>
          <l>Dancing in foam and ripple still,</l>
          <l>When it had neared the mainland hill.«</l></lg></quote></cit>


        <p>It is easy to understand that Scott's writings, with their glorification of the
          chivalrous virtues, of daring and courage, even when displayed by rebel chiefs, pirates,
          gipsies, smugglers, &amp;c.; in short, with its tendency in the direction of Byronic
          partiality for the bold and wild, were, from one point of view, highly objectionable in
          the eyes of the moral and Christian poets of the Lake School. Coleridge charged his novels
          with »ministering to the depraved appetite for excitement, and creating sympathy for the
          vicious and infamous, solely because the fiend is daring«; and he concluded his
          ill-natured attack with the incorrect prophecy: »Not twenty lines of Scott's poetry will
          ever reach posterity; it has relation to nothing.«</p>

        <p>In 1812 the first two cantos of <emph>Childe Harold</emph> saw the light. Not long after their
          publication, Byron wrote a most friendly letter to Scott, containing a hearty apology for
          the foolish attack in <emph>English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</emph>. The younger poet had hastily
          taunted and reproached the elder, not only with choosing as his favourite hero a mixture
          of felon and knight (»not quite a felon, yet but half a knight«), but with accepting
          payment for his works (»racking his brains for lucre, not for fame«)–a thing which, in
          his youth, Byron's aristocratic pride prevented his doing, much as he stood in need of
          money. After he left England for the second time, he, too, learned to make his art a
          lucrative profession. He <pb n="117"/> repented his rash condemnation of Scott as heartily as he
          repented all his other hasty judgments of the same nature, and the strained relationship
          between the two great and noble-hearted men gave way to the most friendly feeling.</p>

        <p>The influence of <emph>Childe Harold</emph> on Scott's literary career was decisive. He was
          unbiassed enough to see plainly that he could not compete with Byron in narrative poetry,
          and he therefore determined to turn his attention to another branch of literature, that in
          which he was soon to stand unrivalled.</p>

        <p>The various utterances on this subject, and all the utterances regarding Byron, which are
          to be found in Scott's Life and Letters testify to the kindly disposition and attractive
          frankness of the great Scottish author. In 1821 he said to a friend: »In truth, I have
          long given up poetry. I have had my day with the public; and being no great believer in
          poetical immortality, I was very well pleased to rise a winner, without continuing the
          game till I was beggared of any credit I had acquired. Besides, I felt the prudence of
          giving way before the more forcible and powerful genius of Byron. If I were either greedy,
          or jealous of poetical fame, I might comfort myself with the thought, that I would
          hesitate to strip myself for the contest so fearlessly as Byron does; or to command the
          wonder and terror of the public by exhibiting, in my own person, the sublime attitude of
          the dying gladiator. But with the old frankness of twenty years since, I will fairly own,
          that this same delicacy of mine may arise more from conscious want of vigour and
          inferiority, than from a delicate dislike to the nature of the conflict.« And when, the
          year before his death, he was asked why he had relinquished poetry, he said quite simply:
          »Because Byron beat me.« The gentleman with whom he was talking rejoined that he, for his
          part, remembered as many passages of his friend's poetry as of Byron's. Scott replied:
          »That may be, but he beat me out of the field in the description of the strong passions,
          and in deep-seated knowledge of the human heart.« The recognition of this fact must have
          been a blow to Scott, but he could seek solace in the thought which he himself expressed
          thus: »If I had occasion to be mortified by the display of genius which threw into the
          shade such pretensions <pb n="118"/> as I was then supposed to possess, I might console myself that, in
          my own case, the materials of mental happiness had been mingled in a greater
          proportion.«</p>

        <p><emph>Waverley</emph>, published anonymously in February 1814, was the first of the long series of
          novels which made Scott and his country famous throughout the whole civilised world. These
          works appeared at the time when the conclusion of peace with France and the hopeful
          prospects of the country generally, had occasioned a special access of national pride.
          They are not works which, like those of the greatest writers, Goethe and Shelley, for
          instance, indicate different stages of their author's development and culture; nor are
          they works inspired by profoundly moving personal experiences; they are the mature
          productions of an inexhaustible gift of story-telling and an extraordinary talent for
          description both of men and things. They mark a distinct advance in two matters–the
          understanding of history, and the representation of the life of the middle and lower
          classes.</p>

        <p>The historians of the eighteenth century, who saw, or expected, the realisation of the
          ideal in their own day, took up the position rather of orators than of authors; they
          occupied themselves with theoretical questions of government and civilisation, without
          consideration of the influence of climatic and geographical conditions, or of the past
          history of a nation–the conception of a nation as a race seldom suggesting itself to
          them. Sir Walter Scott, on the other hand, made it his endeavour as a writer of historical
          fiction to give a vivid impression of the peculiarities of certain periods and countries;
          and he felt the less temptation to endow his heroes with the characteristics of his own
          day, as he in his inmost heart preferred the bright, stirring life of the past to the
          colourless reasonableness of that of his own century.</p>

        <p>A few years previously, Chateaubriand had, in <emph>Les Martyrs</emph>, made the first attempt to
          measure each age by its own standard, and to present the past to us in living pictures.
          But Scott was the real discoverer and first employer of that <emph>local colouring</emph> in
          literature which became the basis of the whole production of French Romanticism. Hugo,
          Mérimée, and Gautier took to it at once. And Scott's <pb n="119"/> historic sense not only made him the
          pioneer of a whole school of poetry; it gave his unassuming novels an immense influence
          over the whole historical literature of the new century. It was, for example, his
          <emph>Ivanhoe</emph>, with its description of the strained relations between the Normans and the
          Saxons, which first suggested to Augustin Thierry the idea that the original force which
          produced such results as the exploits of Clovis, Charlemagne, and Hugo Capet, was the
          racial antagonism between the Gauls and the Franks. The man whose gift of insight into the
          inner life of the modern individual human being was so slight, and who in an age of
          peculiarly independent individual development, was hampered and biassed by the prejudices
          of patriotism, loyalty, and orthodox piety–this man, thanks to his vigorous Naturalism,
          had, when he observed these same individuals as a clan, as a nation, or as a race, a
          perfect understanding of their character as such. Accustomed as he was to reflect on the
          difference between Scotchmen and Englishmen, it was not unnatural that the idea of the
          racial antipathy between the Anglo-Saxons and the Normans should, as by an inspiration,
          occur to him; and his understanding in such matters makes his descriptions of the same
          value to the student of racial, as Byron's are to the student of individual,
          psychology.</p>

        <p>And to this merit has to be added the great merit of his tales as descriptions of typical
          representatives of all classes of society. In the novels of the eighteenth
          century–Fielding's, for example–we pass from one tavern scene to another; in Scott's we
          are introduced into private life, with all its domestic details. The descriptions owe
          their peculiar excellence to the vigorous realism with which each separate personage is
          depicted. Englishmen have always specially prized in their authors the gift of describing
          with such distinct, tangible detail that the object described stands out in relief before
          the reader's eye; their sturdy, healthy intellects enjoy the graphic vigour. They like the
          poetical picture executed in such strong colours that we see it before us as if it were a
          coat of arms painted on a shield. Scott, as a novelist, gratified this taste. His readers
          gladly forgave <pb n="120"/> him the terrible prolixity of his descriptions and his conversations,
          because the result was a graphic representation, attained either by enumerating a long
          list of attributes or by perpetual insistence upon some one characteristic trait. And
          there is no doubt, that, tiresome as his procedure may sometimes be, he is one of the
          greatest character portrayers in all literature. Romanticism has produced nothing finer
          than such female characters as Diana Vernon in <emph>Rob Roy</emph> and Jeanie Deans in <emph>The Heart of
          Midlothian</emph>, or such a historic portrait as Louis XI. in <emph>Quentin Durward</emph>.</p>

        <p>But in his production of fiction, Scott was from the beginning guilty of one great
          malpractice, a malpractice which descended to a whole group of talented novelists of a
          younger generation, namely, the inartistic hurry with which, tempted by the prospect of an
          enormously high price, he produced book after book as if they had been so many articles of
          manufacture. In 1809, he had entered into business relations with a firm of printers and
          publishers of the name of Ballantyne, who printed and published the <emph>Quarterly Review</emph> for
          him; after he began to write novels he actually became a partner in this firm, which was,
          unfortunately, a more enterprising than safe one. <emph>Guy Mannering</emph> was written and printed
          in twenty-five days; and Scott was soon producing at the average rate of twelve volumes in
          a year; it was quite an ordinary thing for him to write forty printed pages in a morning.
          The sale corresponded to the enormous production; 10,000 copies of <emph>Rob Roy</emph> were sold in
          one week; and the later novels were disposed of even faster. In the year 1822, 145,000
          volumes of the novels, old and new, were issued. The prices Scott received increased with
          the circulation of his books. For the two first editions of the <emph>Life of Napoleon</emph> he was
          paid £18,000, and his yearly receipts until 1826 were never less than £12,000. He spent
          his money in improving and enlarging his estate of Abbotsford, and in the erecting thereon
          of a castle-like mansion, where, with princely hospitality, he entertained hosts of
          visitors, many of whom settled down and made a lengthy stay. His fame and popularity
          increased steadily.</p>

        <p><pb n="121"/> On the occasion of a visit to London in 1815, during which he was <emph>fêted</emph>, not only as
          the author, but as the patriot–the distinguished citizen of Edinburgh who had made
          himself conspicuous by his ardent hatred of Napoleon–he was presented to the Prince
          Regent, who showed him many marks of favour. An anecdote has been preserved which gives an
          idea of the kind of wit with which the heir-apparent succeeded in ingratiating himself for
          a short time with those whose friendship he desired. There was a supper-party at the
          Prince Regent's, and Scott, as the guest of the evening, had been kept talking and telling
          stories almost without intermission, the Prince all the time trying, jestingly, to
          inveigle him into owning himself to be the author of the Waverley Novels. Scott skilfully
          extricated himself from one dilemma after another. To prevent further questioning he
          entertained the company with a true story of an old acquaintance, the Scottish judge, Lord
          Braxfield. When on circuit, Braxfield was in the habit of spending a night at the house of
          a wealthy landed proprietor, who, like himself, was a keen chess-player. They often left a
          game to be finished the following year. The said landed proprietor committed a forgery,
          and it fell to Braxfield's lot to pronounce the sentence of death on his friend, and
          opponent in the game. He put on the black cap and read the sentence, which ends with the
          words, »to be hanged by the neck until you be dead.« Having concluded the awful formula
          with due solemnity, he took off the cap, and with a satisfied smile and nod to his old
          partner, added: »And now, Donald, my man, I think I've checkmated ye for ance.« The words
          were hardly out of Scott's mouth when the Prince Regent shouted: »A bumper with all the
          honours to the author of <emph>Waverley!</emph> and another of the same to the author of <emph>Marmion!</emph>«
          adding, with a laugh at Scott's conscious expression and gestures of denial: »And now,
          Walter, my man, I have checkmated you for <emph>ance!</emph>«</p>

        <p><emph>The Heart of Midlothian</emph> one of the best of Scott's works, appeared in 1818, and raised
          him to the height of his fame. It was followed, in December 1819, by <emph>Ivanhoe</emph>, which was
          also received with the most enthusiastic approbation. We learn, <pb n="122"/> in connection with this
          masterly novel, how few and how insignificant were the elements of reality which Scott
          required as a foundation for his imaginary world. A certain Mr. Skene, who had been
          travelling in Germany, told him a good deal about the condition of the Jews there, their
          peculiar dress and customs, and the severity with which they were treated. This was enough
          foundation for a story of such quality as that of Isaac and Rebecca. Scott in private life
          held, as we have seen, extremely narrow-minded opinions on the question of the political
          rights of dissenters from the established religion of the country; it is, consequently,
          all the greater honour to him that, as an author, he was unprejudiced enough to make a
          Jewess the heroine of his novel, and to endow her with such a matchlessly ideal and yet
          natural character.</p>

        <p>In 1823 appeared <emph>Quentin Durward</emph>, a work in which Sir Walter for the first time chose a
          foreign theme, and which made his fame as great in France, Germany, and Italy as it
          already was in England and America. A perusal of the journal of Mr. Skene's tour in France
          was all that was necessary to enable the author to give his tale its admirable local
          colouring.</p>

        <p>Scott's name was now in every one's mouth, and was familiar even to the most uneducated
          of his countrymen. In London, at the time of the coronation of George IV., he got into a
          crowd on the line of the royal procession, and was in actual danger because of his
          lameness. He addressed a sergeant, begging to be allowed to pass by him into the open
          ground in the middle of the street. The man answered shortly that his orders were strict,
          that the thing was impossible. Some new wave of turbulence approaching from behind, Sir
          Walter's companion cried in a loud voice: »Take care, Sir Walter Scott, take care!« The
          stalwart dragoon, on hearing the name, said: »What! Sir Walter Scott! He shall get through
          anyhow!« He then addressed the soldiers near him–»Make room, men, for Sir Walter Scott,
          our great countryman!« The men answered: »Sir Walter Scott!–God bless him!«–and he was
          in a moment within the guarded line of safety. We are reminded of the <pb n="123"/> story of the French
          army in Africa receiving Horace Vernet with flourish of trumpet and beat of drum, and all
          the military honours due to a general. One can hardly imagine a greater triumph for an
          artist than this homage of the people.</p>

        <p>In 1826 came a turn in the great man's fortunes. The firm of Ballantyne, in which he was
          a partner, failed; and to the horror of Sir Walter, who in all private money matters was
          scrupulously exact, the deficit proved to amount to the enormous sum of £117,000. He bore
          his ruin like a man. The Royal Bank sent a deputation to him with the message that it
          placed itself at his disposal; he received an anonymous offer of a gift of £30,000; but
          these and all other offers of assistance he refused. He heroically resolved on the
          desperate course of endeavouring to pay off the enormous debt with his pen, determining to
          work without respite until he had discharged the liabilities with which the recklessness
          and carelessness of others had burdened him. It is not surprising that from this time
          onwards the quality of his works degenerated steadily. The unfortunate author signed
          contracts for books–bound himself to produce so and so many volumes per year, of the
          contents of which, nay, of the very titles of which he had not even thought.</p>

        <p>At this unhappy time, only a few months after the failure, he lost his beloved wife. The
          pressure of business was such that he was unable to sit by her deathbed. He wrote
          ceaselessly–half a volume of <emph>Woodstock</emph> in four days–harassed all the time by the
          claims of unfortunate creditors. The man who was accustomed to have his house full of
          visitors, now lived the life of a hermit. Captain Basil Hall has described the painful
          impression it made on him to see Sir Walter Scott, who had been in the habit of taking his
          meals with his wife opposite him and friends and strangers round his table, sitting down
          alone, to a table laid for one.</p>

        <p>He undertook several journeys–one to Paris, for the purpose of collecting authentic
          anecdotes concerning Napoleon. On this occasion a deputation of the <emph>dames de la halle</emph>
          presented him with a monster bouquet. He issued a complete edition of his works; of the
          first nine volumes <pb n="124"/> 35,000 copies were sold. He paid many of his debts. The political
          reforms in England were a subject of great grief to him; in 1830 he declared: »England is
          no longer a place for an honest man.« Exhausted, ill, with part of his face disfigured by
          a stroke of paralysis, he went abroad for the last time. In Naples he actually still
          busied himself in collecting the greatest possible number of old Italian ballads and
          songs. He became so ill that he hastened home to die in his own country, and breathed his
          last at Abbotsford in September 1832, exactly six months after Goethe.</p>

        <p>All his life Scott was a sincere, mildly rationalistic believer, entirely unaffected by
          the questioning, daring science of his century. In 1825 he said: »There are few, I trust,
          who disbelieve the existence of a God; nay, I doubt if at all times, and in all moods, any
          single individual ever adopted that hideous creed.« In the course of the same
          conversation, however, he allowed that »penal fires and heavenly melody« were possibly
          only metaphorical expressions. And we know that Lord Byron's dedication of <emph>Cain</emph> to him,
          instead of offending him, gave him pleasure. In religion, as in politics and literature,
          he never attained to personal emancipation from the traditions by which the individual is
          fettered from his birth. Here, too, he left a task which the position of affairs plainly
          imposed, to be accomplished by the next generation of authors.</p>

        <p>When we look back from the vantage-ground of our own day on the second, the prose, period
          of Scott's authorship, we find it impossible to see the long series of the Waverley Novels
          in the same light in which they appeared to his contemporaries. We understand the
          satisfaction which lay in the certainty that they would never give offence, that they
          might always be welcomed gladly, not only as gifted, but as perfectly moral works. This
          particular qualification is, however, exactly what makes them less attractive to us. There
          is no exaggeration in declaring it to be a law in the modern literature of every country,
          that an author must cause offence to at least one generation of his contemporaries, and be
          considered immoral by it, if he is not to seem tiresome and narrow-minded to readers of
          the period immediately succeed<pb n="125"/>ing his own. To us the defects of Scott's novels are very
          plain. They give pleasure by their excellent character-drawing and the liveliness of their
          dialogue, but they do not satisfy the reason, do not appeal very strongly to the feelings,
          do not even arouse any great degree of curiosity. They are soulful, but idealess. We feel
          that Scott, as a patriotic author, was determined to keep up the interest in Scotland
          which Macpherson and Burns had awakened in the reading public; therefore he writes in such
          a manner as to estrange not even the most narrow-minded reader. Himself denied the sensual
          organisation of the artist, he is so discreet in his treatment of the relations between
          the sexes that there is next to no description of erotic situations. And, the moral to be
          conveyed seeming of greater importance to him than art, he represents past ages with such
          a toning down of all the coarse elements that historic truth suffers terribly. The species
          of fiction which Scott introduced, and which indicated a distinct step in advance of the
          older novel, is now in its turn antiquated; the literary critics of every country lean to
          the opinion that the historical novel, with all its merits, is a bastard species–now it
          is so hampered with historical material that the poetic development of the story is
          rendered impossible, again it is so free in its paraphrase of history that the real and
          the fictitious elements produce a very discordant whole. In the third volume of <emph>The Heart
          of Midlothian</emph> (Chap, x.), for example, the manner in which imaginary speeches are mixed
          up with the historical utterances of the Duke of Argyle, distinctly offends the critical
          taste. It becomes, moreover, increasingly evident how different the general impression
          conveyed by Scott's pictures of past times is from the essential character of these
          far-off days, an unvarnished representation of which, supposing it to be understood at
          all, would certainly fail to awaken sympathy. His <emph>Tales of the Crusaders</emph> are
          circulating-library novels, which describe the wonder-lands and the romantic, adventurous
          deeds of the Crusades with almost as little regard to reality as Tasso's <emph>Gerusalemme
          Liberata</emph>; but which do not display anything like the Italian's poetic talent, or his
          artistically conscientious attention to style.</p>

        <p><pb n="126"/> How could it be otherwise in the case of an author like Scott, who wrote without ever
          re-reading, much less correcting, a page, who had not the gift of conciseness, and who
          made no serious demands on himself in the matter of composition? He demands still less of
          his readers, as far as attention and quick apprehension are concerned. He repeats himself
          and allows his characters to repeat themselves, puts in his word in the middle of the
          story, points out and explains. Not satisfied with showing the temperament and character
          of his personages by their mode of action, he makes them, when necessary, give account of
          themselves in such phrases as: »I am speaking with calmness, though it is contrary to my
          character«; or in speeches in which the speaker draws the moral lesson from his own wicked
          actions, in case the reader should by any chance miss it and be tempted to imitation.
          (Read, for example, George Staunton's whole confession to Jeanie Deans, a model of bad
          style and false psychology.) With such serious faults as these in the details, it is of
          little avail that the plots of the best novels are excellent, leading up naturally to
          dramatic crises, one or more as the case may be. A book which is to retain its fame for
          centuries must not only be poetically planned, but artistically elaborated in every
          detail–a task for which Scott, from the moment he began to write in prose, never left
          himself time. Even the most dramatic scene he ever wrote–the splendid and powerfully
          affecting trial-scene in <emph>The Heart of Midlothian</emph>, in which Jeanie, with a bleeding
          heart, but with noble devotion to the truth, gives witness against her own sister–loses
          half of its effect from the careless prolixity of the style. We learn from Moore's
          <emph>Memoirs</emph> that the main theme of the book–the story of the young girl who refuses to give
          witness in court in favour of her sister, and afterwards undertakes the long journey to
          beg a pardon for her–is a true story, which was communicated to Scott in an anonymous
          letter. He has evidently had the keenest perception of the moral beauty of the incident,
          but very little of its essentially dramatic character. If he had possessed only half the
          amount of talent that he had, along with double the amount of culture and instinct of
          self-criticism, <pb n="127"/> he would doubtless have made less stir in the world, but he would have
          produced works of greater and more enduring value.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">He does not seem to have had any understanding of plastic art. Desiring to give an
            impression of the old Puritan in <emph>The Heart of Midlothian</emph>, he evolves the following
            artistically impossible fabulous creature: »The whole formed a picture, of which the
            lights might have been given by Rembrandt, but the outline would have required the force
            and vigour of Michael Angelo.«</note> He himself felt that what prevented
          him from attaining to the highest in the domain of literature was his defective education.
          In his <emph>Journal</emph> (i. 56, 57) there is a curious little survey of his life: »What a life
          mine has been!–<emph>half educated, almost wholly neglected or left to myself</emph>, stuffing my
          head with most nonsensical trash, undervalued in society for a time by most of my
          companions, getting forward, and held a bold, clever fellow, contrary to the opinion of
          all who thought me a mere dreamer.... Now taken in my pitch of pride, and nearly winged,
          because London chooses to be in an uproar, and in the tumult of bulls and bears, a poor
          inoffensive lion like myself is pushed to the wall.«</p>

        <p>It is a dangerous thing for a modern author to be entirely unaffected by the progress of
          science. If he has not, like Byron, the gift of divining by a kind of clairvoyance what
          science is seeking and ascertaining, his works fall from the hands of the cultivated
          reader, to be seized by readers who are only seeking entertainment; or they are preserved
          and bound by the cultivated readers, to be given away as birthday and Christmas gifts to
          their sons and daughters, nephews and nieces. Such has been Scott's fate. The author who
          in the second and third decades of the nineteenth century ruled the book-market, whose
          influence was felt in every country of Europe, who in France had imitators like Alfred de
          Vigny, Hugo, Mérimée, Balzac, and the elder Dumas (<emph>The Three Musketeers</emph>), in Italy a
          disciple like Manzoni, in Germany an intellectual kinsman like Fouqué, in Denmark admirers
          and pupils like Poul Möller, Ingemann, and Hauch, has become, by the silent, instructive
          verdict of time, the favourite author of boys and girls of fourteen or thereabouts, an
          author whom all grown-up people have read, and no grown-up people read.</p>

        <p>Thus speaks Oceanus. And the fallen deities, either convinced or in sullen anger, keep

          <l>There to remain for ever, as I fear:</l>
          <l>I would not bode of evil, if I thought</l>

          <l>I stood upon a shore, a pleasant shore,</l>
          <l>Where a sweet clime was breathed from a land</l>
          <l>Of fragrance, quietness, and trees, and flowers.</l>
          <l>Full of calm joy it was, as I of grief;</l>

          <l>With songs of misery, music of our woes;</l>
          <l>And sat me down, and took a mouthed shell</l>

          <l>And with poor skill let pass into the breeze</l>
          <l>The dull shell's echo, from a bowery strand</l>
          <l>Just opposite, an island of the sea,</l>
          <l>There came enchantment with the shifting wind,</l>
          <l>That did both drown and keep alive my ears.</l>
          <l>I threw my shell away upon the sand,</l>
          <l>And a wave fill'd it, as my sense was fill'd</l>
          <l>With that new blissful golden melody,</l>
          <l>A living death was in each gush of sounds,</l>
          <l>Each family of rapturous hurried notes,</l>
          <l>That fell, one after one, yet all at once,</l> 
          <l>Like pearl beads dropping sudden from their string:</l> 
          <l>And then another, then another strain,</l>
          <l>Each like a dove leaving its olive perch,</l>
          <l>With music wing'd instead of silent plumes,</l>
          <l>To hover round my head, and make me sick</l>
          <l>Of joy and grief at once. Grief overcame,</l>
          <l>And I was stopping up my frantic ears,</l>
          <l>When, past all hindrance of my trembling hands,</l>
          <l>A voice came sweeter, sweeter than all tune,</l>
          <l>And still it cried, 'Apollo! young Apollo!</l>
          <l>The morning-bright Apollo! young Apollo!'</l>
          <l>I fled, it followed me, and cried 'Apollo!'«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p><pb n="131"/> Keats has surpassed himself in this passage, which is as profound in thought as it is
          beautiful. It is not only a proof of the quality of his poetic gift, but the announcement
          of the appearance of a younger generation of poets in the field held by the poets of the
          Lake School and Scott. In the name of the reigning deities, the human intellect is too
          often condemned to inactivity and stagnation. If there is to be progress, a change of
          rulers is frequently called for. Wordsworth and Scott were mighty Titans whose glory paled
          when the younger generation appeared. Keats himself was the golden-feathered bird that
          rose high into the air above Wordsworth's leafy old oak. And Byron–was not he the new
          ocean god, who »troubled the waters« of passion with such power that the greatest literary
          genius of the day abdicated in his favour, assured that it was in vain to compete with
          him? And Shelley's melodies, intoxicatingly sweet, unprecedentedly daring–were they not
          borne on all the winds, and are they not still penetrating everywhere, though many, like
          Clymene, stop their ears and refrain as long as possible from listening to the new tones?
          The struggle is a vain one, for now on every side resounds the cry: »Apollo!
          morning-bright Apollo!«</p>

        <p>The old gods, as in the poem, assumed different attitudes at this crisis in their fates.
          Scott, the noblest of them all, acknowledged his defeat by Byron with an amiable dignity
          which still further enhanced his reputation. Wordsworth retired to his Lakes, muttering an
          accusation of plagiarism. Southey poured forth volleys of abuse. Meanwhile the new, young
          gods mounted the thrones of the old, and round their heads shone the bright halo of the
          light that they gave forth.</p>

        <p>Keats was the youngest of the young race of giants, and he had peculiar qualities and a
          peculiar domain of his own, into which none of the others intruded. He is one of the many
          examples of singularly delicate and refined organisms appearing in the most unlikely
          outward surroundings and developing almost unaided by circumstances. This youth who, dying
          at the age of twenty-six, has left behind him <pb n="132"/> master-works which none who read them can
          forget, and whose name is immortalised in Shelley's <emph>Adonais</emph>, was the son of a London
          livery-stable keeper, and was bred an apothecary. Few of the elder literary celebrities
          knew him. Wordsworth, the only one among them on whom his eyes were steadily turned, and
          with more reverence than was felt by any of the other young men–even Wordsworth showed
          himself cold. At Haydon the painter's, one evening, when Wordsworth was present, Keats was
          induced to repeat to him the famous Hymn to Pan from the First Book of <emph>Endymion</emph>. The
          »iron-grey poet« heard it to the end, and then only remarked that it was »a pretty piece
          of paganism.« And so, praise be to Keats, it is! Wordsworth, however, meant nothing
          flattering by the remark. Such was the verdict of the most influential member of the elder
          school of poetry. The elder school of criticism was distinctly adverse. Its verdict was
          harsh and scathing. Both the <emph>Quarterly Review</emph> and <emph>Blackwood's Magazine</emph> jeered
          foolishly at <emph>Endymion</emph>. The author was told that »it is a better and a wiser thing to be
          a starved apothecary than a starved poet,« and was bidden »back to his gallipots.« Calmly
          as the young poet writes of the ignominious treatment he received, there can be no doubt
          that the sting rankled deeply. It is most improbable that the report spread among Keats's
          acquaintances of the ruinous effect of these criticisms on his health, was, as is now
          maintained, entirely without foundation. He certainly was not, as Byron in <emph>Don Juan</emph>
          declares him to have been, killed by a savage article in the <emph>Quarterly</emph>; and his own
          utterances give ample proof of his profound contempt for these disparagements of his art
          and his personality; but his ambition was excessive, his susceptibility equally so, and
          his body contained the germs of a fatal disease; and it would be surprising if rancorous
          attacks from without had not affected an organism which was preyed upon from within by
          consuming passion and consuming disease.</p>

        <p>John Keats was born in October 1795. At the age of nine he lost his father. His mother
          sent him to a good school; but she, too, to his inexpressible grief, died while he was
          still a boy. His appearance corresponded to the <pb n="133"/> impression which his poetry makes on us.
          Whilst the feminine and ethereal Shelley had a slender, slightly-built, narrow-chested
          figure and a shrill voice, the heavier footed, more earth-bound Keats was deep-chested and
          broad-shouldered; his lower limbs were small in comparison with the upper; and he had a
          deep, grave voice. His small head was covered with thick brown curls; the eyes were large
          and of a dark, on occasion glowing, blue; the handsome mouth had a projecting lower lip,
          which gave the face a defiant and pugnacious expression. And as a matter of fact he was,
          as a boy, a perfect little terrier for resoluteness and pugnacity, and seemed much more
          likely to distinguish himself in war than in literature. He early displayed great personal
          courage, and was an adept in all athletic exercises; just before he was attacked by
          consumption he thrashed an insolent butcher in a regular stand-up fight.</p>

        <p>At the age of fifteen he left school, and was apprenticed by his relations to a clever
          surgeon-apothecary at Edmonton, with whom he remained till he was twenty, when he began,
          as a medical student, to walk the London hospitals. He soon, however, gave up medicine for
          literature, and lived for several years in close companionship with some of the rising
          young literary men and artists of the day. Then he was attacked by the disease which had
          carried off his mother and his younger brother. The absence of any prospect of earning a
          living, and the ever-increasing pressure of poverty, favoured its development, which was
          farther hastened by a violent and hopeless passion for a young Anglo-Indian lady–a
          passion only rendered hopeless by Keats's poverty and ill-health–his love being returned.
          His health obliged him to quit the neighbourhood of his beloved and take a journey to
          Italy, where he died.</p>

        <p>Glancing over the non-literary part of Keats's life, we distinguish three facts of
          leading importance–his want of any real prospect of gaining a livelihood (he had thoughts
          of emigrating to South America, or applying for a post as surgeon on an Indiaman); the
          ardent and hopeless passion for the woman without whom life was worthless to him; and the
          wasting disease.</p>

        <p><pb n="134"/> Miss Fanny Brawne was eighteen, five years younger than Keats, when he made her
          acquaintance in 1818. He and his friend, Brown, had settled at Hampstead, in a
          semidetached house, the other half of which was occupied by Miss Brawne and her mother.
          The first six months after he fell in love were to Keats months of real happiness. In
          December 1818 he began <emph>Hyperion</emph>. In February 1819, the most fruitful month in his life,
          he wrote the <emph>Ode to Psyche, The Eve of St Agnes</emph>, and great part of <emph>Hyperion</emph>. And early
          in the spring, sitting under a plum-tree in the Brawnes' garden, he wrote his <emph>Ode to the
          Nightingale</emph>. In other words–his most beautiful poetry was written in the half year
          during which he took long walks with Fanny, and was still a healthy man. Unfortunately, it
          being possible for him to see his beloved every day, we have not a single love-letter
          dating from this, his short period of happiness. In July 1819 he wrote to her for the
          first time; and all the letters which he sent her from that date until the time of his
          death were published in 1878.</p>

        <p>They are not melancholy to begin with. In one of the earliest he writes: »I want a
          brighter word than bright, a fairer word than fair;« and to some objection made by her he
          answers: »Why may I not speak of your Beauty, since without that I could never have lov'd
          you?–I cannot conceive any beginning of such love as I have for you but Beauty. There may
          be a sort of love for which, without the least sneer at it, I have the highest respect and
          can admire it in others; but it has not the richness, the bloom, the full form, the
          enchantment of love after my own heart.«</p>

        <p>Very soon, however, the jealousy which was to have such a wearing effect upon the lover
          appears in his letters. Again and again he exacts promises of eternal devotion. Though not
          yet ill, he has a vague presentiment that his end is not far off. »I have two luxuries to
          brood over in my walks,« he writes; »your Loveliness and the hour of my death. O that I
          could have possession of them both in the same minute!«</p>

        <p>Her letters had really only a depressing effect on him. He read them so often that each
          sentence assumed a dis<pb n="135"/>torted proportion; and they seemed to him now cold, now full of
          reproaches. He tortured first himself and then her with his suspicious irritableness and
          perversity; he would, for example, pass her door without going in, though he was longing
          to see her, and knew that his not appearing was a disappointment to her. There are a few
          perfectly happy, tender letters, dated October 1819. But in February 1820 commences a
          period of miserable excitement. He begins to spit blood, and »reads his death-warrant in
          its colour.« After this the letters are short, some of them still playful and hopeful,
          others suspicious and violent in their jealousy–all brimming over with passion. Here is a
          fragment: »You know our situation–what hope is there if I should be recovered ever so
          soon–my very health will not suffer me to make any great exertion. I am recommended not
          even to read poetry, much less write it. I cannot say forget me–but I would mention that
          there are impossibilities in the world. No more of this. I am not strong enough to be
          weaned–take no notice of it in your goodnight.«</p>

        <p>During his apparent convalescence he is constantly begging her to come and show herself
          only for half a minute outside of the window through which he can see her, or to walk a
          little in the garden. Then he asks her not to come every day, because he cannot always
          bear to see her. But when, according to his wish, she does not come, he is restless and
          jealous.</p>

        <p>As the end approaches, the letters become ever sadder and more distressing to read. The
          last of them are positively harrowing. He is as wild and helpless in his passionate
          despair as a child who believes himself forgotten. It is the mental death-struggle
          preceding the physical.</p>

        <p>Fanny Brawne's tenderness for her lover never wavered. It is now evident that, as was
          only natural, this young girl with the touch of coquetry in her nature had no suspicion
          whatever of the gifts and powers of the poor consumptive youth who worshipped and tortured
          her. But she loved him for his own sake, and when, from the last letter, she learned in
          what a sad condition he really was, she and her <pb n="136"/>mother would no longer leave him to the
          care of his friend, but took him into their own house in Wentworth Place, where he lived
          for the last month before he left for Italy. A stay in that country had been prescribed,
          as giving him a last chance of recovery.</p>

        <p>The man to whom, in other circumstances, the prospect of seeing the country for which he
          had always longed, and whose gods he had awakened from the dead, would have given supreme
          happiness, now writes: »This journey to Italy wakes me at daylight every morning, and
          haunts me horribly. I shall endeavour to go, though it be with the sensation of marching
          up against a Battery.« On board ship he writes, referring to his attachment to Miss
          Brawne: »Even if my body would recover of itself, this would prevent it. The very thing
          which I want to live most for will be a great occasion of my death. I cannot help it.... I
          wish for death every day and night to deliver me from these pains, and then I wish death
          away, for death would destroy even those pains which are better than nothing. Land and
          sea, weakness and decline, are great separators, but death is the great divorcer for
          ever.... I seldom think of my brother and sister in America. The thought of leaving Miss
          Brawne is beyond everything horrible–the sense of darkness coming over me–I eternally
          see her figure eternally vanishing.« And in another letter he writes: »The persuasion that
          I shall see her no more will kill me. My dear Brown, I should have had her when I was in
          health, and I should have remained well. I can bear to die–I cannot bear to leave her. O
          God! God! God! Everything I have in my trunks that reminds me of her goes through me like
          a spear. The silk lining she put in my travelling cap scalds my head. My imagination is
          horribly vivid about her–I see her–I hear her. There is nothing in the world of
          sufficient interest to divert me from her for a moment.... I cannot say a word about
          Naples; I do not feel at all concerned in the thousand novelties around me. I am afraid to
          write to her–I should like her to know that I do not forget her. Oh, Brown, I have coals
          of fire in my breast. It surprises me that the human heart <pb n="137"/> is capable of containing and
          bearing so much misery. Was I born for this end?«</p>

        <p>On the last day of November 1820, Keats wrote his last letter. His intimate old friend,
          Dr. Clark, a skilful physician, preserved his life till the end of the winter. While in
          Naples, Keats received a letter from his brother poet, Shelley, inviting him to come to
          Pisa, where he would be nursed and cared for in every way. But this invitation he did not
          accept. After several weeks of great suffering came rest and sleep, resignation and
          tranquillity. He desired that a letter from his beloved, which he had not dared to read,
          along with a purse and a letter which he had received from his sister, should be placed in
          his coffin; and that on his gravestone should be inscribed:</p>

        <p>Keats's poetry is the most fragrant flower of English Naturalism. Before he appeared,
          this Naturalism had had a long period of vigorous growth. Its active principle had been
          evolved by Wordsworth, who developed it so methodically that he divided his poems into
          groups, corresponding to the different periods of human life and the different faculties
          of the soul. Coleridge provided it with the support of a philosophy of nature which had a
          strong resemblance to Schelling's. In Scott it assumes the highly successful form of a
          study of men, manners, and scenery, inspired by patriotism, by interest in history, and by
          a wonderful apprehension of the significance of race. Both in Moore and Keats it takes the
          form of gorgeous sensuousness, is the literary expression of the perceptions of beings
          whose sensitiveness to impressions of the beauty of the external world makes that of the
          average human being seem blunt and dull. But the sensuousness of Moore's poetry, which
          reveals itself <pb n="138"/> artistically in his warm, bright colouring, is confined to the erotic
          domain, and is of a light and playful character. Keats's is full-blooded, serious
          sensuousness, by no means specially erotic, but all-embracing, and, in this its
          comprehensiveness, one of the most admirable developments of English Naturalism. This
          Naturalism led Wordsworth into one extreme, which has already been referred to; Keats it
          led into a different and more poetical one.</p>

        <p>Keats was more of the artist than any of his English brother poets. He troubled himself
          less about principles than any of them. There is no groundwork of patriotism in his poetry
          as there is in Scott's and Moore's; no message of liberty, as in Shelley's and Byron's; it
          is pure art, owing its origin to nothing but the power of imagination. It was one of his
          favourite sayings, that the poet should have no principles, no morality, <emph>no self</emph>. Why?
          Because the true poet enjoys both light and shade–has as much delight in conceiving an
          Iago as an Imogen. All poets who have forgotten themselves in the theme of their flights
          of fancy, have, when engaged in production, to the best of their ability banished their
          private peculiarities and preferences. Few have managed to make such a clean sweep as
          Keats of their personal hopes, enthusiasms, and principles. His study was, as one of his
          admirers has said, »a painter's studio with very little in it besides the easel.«</p>

        <p>Keats's poetical indifference to theories and principles was, however, in itself a theory
          and a principle–was the philosophy which has its foundation in poetic worship of nature.
          To the consistent pantheistic poet all forms, all shapes, all expressions of life on earth
          which engage the imagination, are precious, and all equally precious. Keats, as poet,
          recognises no truth of the kind that means improvement or exclusion; but he has an almost
          religious faith in imagination as the source of truth. In one of his letters he expresses
          himself thus:–»I am certain of nothing but of the holiness of the heart's affections, and
          the truth of Imagination. What the Imagination seizes as Beauty must be Truth, whether it
          existed before or not;–for I have the same idea of all our passions as of Love: they are
          all, in <pb n="139"/> their sublime, creative of essential Beauty.... The Imagination may be compared to
          Adam's dream; he awoke and found it truth.« He enlarges on the difference between this
          kind of truth and the truth arrived at by consecutive reasoning, and concludes with an
          exclamation which is a key to the whole of his poetry:–»However it may be, O for a life
          of sensations rather than of thoughts!«</p>

        <p>He led in great part a life of passive sensation, of pleasure and pain through the
          senses. »Take,« says Masson, »a book of physiology and go over the so-called classes of
          sensations one by one–the sensations of the mere muscular states; the sensations
          connected with such vital processes as circulation, alimentation, respiration, and
          electrical intercommunication with surrounding bodies; the sensations of taste; those of
          odour; those of hearing; and those of sight–and Keats will be found to have been
          unusually endowed in them all.«</p>

        <p>He had, for example, an extreme sensitiveness to the pleasures of the palate, and tried
          to heighten them by extraordinary stimulants. A friend tells us that he once saw Keats
          covering his tongue with cayenne pepper, that he might enjoy the delicious sensation of a
          draught of cold claret after it. »Talking of pleasure,« he says himself in one of his
          letters, »this moment I was writing with one hand and with the other holding to my mouth a
          nectarine.« It is therefore not surprising that imagery drawn from the domain of the sense
          of taste is of frequent occurrence in Keats's poetry. In his deservedly famous <emph>Ode to
          Melancholy</emph> we are told that this goddess has her sovran shrine in the very temple of
          Delight–</p>

        
        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Though seen of none save him <emph>whose strenuous tongue</emph></l>
          <l><emph>Can burst Joy's grape against his palate fine!</emph>«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>


        <p>And in one of his last sonnets he characteristically mentions »the palate of my mind
          losing its gust« as an indication of approaching death.</p>

        <p>Naturally the senses of hearing and sight provided him with a much greater proportion of
          his imagery than the inferior, less noble senses. He had a musician's love of <pb n="140"/> music and a
          painter's eye for variations of light and colour. And for all the different kinds of sound
          and smell and taste and sensations of touch, he possessed a store of words which any of
          the greatest poets might have envied. In short, he was by nature endowed with qualities
          which in combination, and in their full development, constituted supreme capacity to
          perceive and to reproduce all the beauty of nature.</p>

        <p>To be able to reproduce it was from the very beginning his dream; and the man who
          affirmed that, except in the matter of art, he had no »opinions,« expressed enthusiastic
          approval of the revolution of opinion in regard to the artificial, so-called classical,
          poetry of the eighteenth century, which had been brought about by Wordsworth and
          Coleridge. Spenser was Keats's idol, the classic poets were his aversion. In his poem,
          <emph>Sleep and Poetry</emph>, he has embodied an artistic confession of faith in language which
          could not well be more violent. After describing the old poetic triumphs of England, he
          exclaims:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Could all this be forgotten? Yes, a schism</l>
          <l>Nurtured by foppery and barbarism</l>
          <l>Made great Apollo blush for this his land.</l>
          <l>Men were thought wise who could not understand</l>
          <l>His glories; with a puling infant's force</l>
          <l>They sway'd about upon a rocking-horse</l>
          <l>And thought it Pegasus. Ah! Dismal-soul'd!</l>
          <l>> The winds of heaven blew, the ocean roll'd</l>
          <l>Its gathering waves; ye felt it not. The blue</l> 
          <l>Bared its eternal bosom, and the dew</l>
          <l>Of summer night collected still to make</l>
          <l>The morning precious; Beauty was awake!</l> 
          <l>Why were <emph>ye</emph> not awake? …</l>
          <l>… No, they went about.</l>
          <l>Holding a poor decrepit standard out,</l>
          <l>Mark'd with most flimsy mottoes, and, in large,</l>
          <l>The name of one Boileau!«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>

        <p>Long before the French assault upon this ancient, honoured name, Keats blows the
          war-trumpet! Théophile Gautier himself does not treat it with greater contempt.</p>

        <p>It was probably the above passage, the energetic style of which reminds one of that
          picture of Kaulbach's in Munich, <pb n="141"/> in which the artist of the rococo period is painted
          asleep with the lay-figure in his arms, which gave occasion to Byron's repeated thrusts at
          Keats as the traducer of Pope. For Keats never published a line against Pope; and when
          Countess Guiccioli, in her naïve work on Byron, refers to attacks which infuriated her
          lover, she is only repeating vague remarks she has heard. It is, however, highly probable
          that Keats included Pope among those whom he reproached with being deaf to the music of
          the waves and the winds, and with sleeping whilst the morning unfolded its beauties.</p>

        <p>He himself was not of that company. If we examine the distinctive individuality of
          Keats's genius, we find its determining element to be the all-embracing sensuousness
          already alluded to. Read this stanza of the <emph>Ode to a Nightingale</emph>:–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»O, for a draught of vintage! that hath been</l>
          <l>Cool'd a long age in the deep-delvèd earth,</l>

          <l>Dance, and Provençal song, and sun-burnt mirth!</l>
          <l>O for a beaker full of the warm South,</l>
          <l>Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene,</l>
          <l>With beaded bubbles winking at the brim,</l>
          <l>And purple-stainèd mouth;</l>
          <l>That I might drink, and leave the world unseen,</l>
          <l>And with thee fade away into the forest dim.«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>

        <p>And compare with it the following lines of <emph>Endymion</emph>:–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Taste these juicy pears,</l>
          <l>Sent me by sad Vertumnus; …</l>
          <l>… here is cream,</l>
          <l>Deepening to richness from a snowy gleam;</l>
          <l>Sweeter than that nurse Amalthea skimmed</l>
          <l>For the boy Jupiter: and here, undimmed</l>
          <l>By any touch, a bunch of blooming plums</l>
          <l>Ready to melt between an infant's gums.«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>

        <p>The delicate, highly developed sense of taste is accompanied by an equally delicate and
          highly developed sense of touch and sense of smell. Read the passage in <emph>Isabella</emph>–a poem
          which, following Boccaccio, treats of the same theme as Hans Andersen's tale of the »Rose
          Fairy«–the passage <pb n="142"/> which tells how the young girl took the head of her murdered lover
          from the grave:–</p>

          <l>Through the cold serpent pipe refreshfully,</l>
          <l>She wrapp'd it up.« …</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>

        <p>and the lines in <emph>Lamia</emph>, describing the reception of the guests who come to take part in
          the wedding festivities:–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»When in an antechamber every guest</l>
          <l>Had felt the cold full sponge to pleasure press'd,</l>
          <l>By minist'ring slaves, upon his hands and feet,</l>
          <l>And fragrant oils with ceremony meet</l>
          <l>Pour'd on his hair, they all mov'd to the feast</l>
          <l>In white robes, and themselves in order placed</l>
          <l>Around the silken couches.«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>

        <p>In one of the <emph>Epistles</emph> occurs a line, about a swan, into which is compressed an
          incredible amount of sensuous imagery. It is: »Kissing thy daily food from Naiads' pearly
          hands.«</p>

        <p>It is unnecessary to draw the reader's attention in detail to all the delicate charms of
          these fragments. Proceeding to the domain of the sense of sight, we find that it
          preeminently is Keats's territory, although it is never his eye alone which is impressed
          by his surroundings. Wordsworth's poetry of nature leads us out into the open air;
          following Keats, we enter a hot-house: a soft, moist warmth meets us; our eyes are
          attracted by brightly coloured flowers and juicy fruits; slender palms, amidst whose
          branches no rough wind ever blows, beckon gently with their huge fans. His <emph>Ode to Autumn</emph>
          is a characteristic specimen of his descriptions of nature. After telling of autumn's
          conspiracy with the sun</p>

        <cit><quote><lg><l>»to load and bless</l>
          <l>With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run;</l>
          <l>To bend with apples the moss'd cottage trees,</l>
          <l>And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;</l>
          <l>To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells</l>
          <l>With a sweet kernel,«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p><pb n="143"/> he with a masterly hand portrays autumn as a person:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?</l>
          <l>Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find</l>
          <l>Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,</l>
          <l>Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind:</l>
          <l>Or on a half-reap'd furrow sound asleep,</l>
          <l>Drowsed with the fume of poppies, while thy hook</l>
          <l>Spares the next swath and all its twinèd flowers.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>It is impossible for Keats to name any conception or any thought without at once
          proceeding to represent it in a corporeal, plastic form. His numerous allegories have the
          same life and fire as if they were executed in stone by the best Italian artists of the
          sixteenth century. He says of Melancholy:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg><l>»She dwells with Beauty–Beauty that must die;</l> 
          <l>And Joy, <emph>whose hand is ever at his lips</emph></l>
          <l><emph>Bidding adieu</emph>.«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>

        <p>He says of Poetry:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg><l>»A drainless shower</l>
          <l>Of light is poesy; 'tis the supreme power;</l>
          <l>'Tis <emph>might half-slumb'ring on its own right arm</emph>.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>We see the scope of Keats's poetic powers steadily increasing. His point of departure,
          especially in some of the most beautiful of his smaller poems (for example, the <emph>Ode to
          the Nightingale</emph>), is the description of a purely physical condition, such as weariness,
          nervousness, thirst, languor, the drowsiness produced by opium. Upon this background of
          sensitiveness the sensuous pictures rise, distinct and round, like the reliefs upon a
          shield. The word »welded« comes involuntarily to one's lips when one thinks of Keats's
          pictures. There is something firm and finished about them, as if they were welded on a
          metal plate.</p>

        <p>Observe how the figures rise gradually into relief in the following stanzas, the first
          and third of the beautiful <emph>Ode to Indolence</emph>:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»One morn before me were three figures seen</l>
          <l>With bowed necks and joined hands, side-faced;</l>
          <l>And one behind the other stepped serene,</l>
          <l>In placid sandals, and in white robes graced;</l>
          <l><pb n="144"/> They passed like figures on a marble urn,</l>
          <l>When shifted round to see the other side;</l>
          <l>They came again; as when the urn once more</l>
          <l>Is shifted round, the first green shades return,</l>
          <l>And they were strange to me, as may betide</l>
          <l>With vases, to one deep in Phidian lore</l>
          <l>…</l>
          <l>A third time passed they by, and, passing, turned</l>
          <l>Each one the face a moment whiles to me;</l>
          <l>Then faded, and to follow them I burned</l>
          <l>And ached for wings, because I knew the three;</l>
          <l>The first was a fair maid, and Love her name;</l>
          <l>The second was Ambition, pale of cheek,</l>
          <l>And ever watchful, with fatigued eye;</l>
          <l>The last, whom I love more, the more of blame</l>
          <l>Is heaped upon her, maiden most unmeek,–</l>
          <l>I knew to be my demon, Poesy.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>But not until he wrote the two completed books of <emph>Hyperion</emph> did Keats attain to absolute
          mastery over his artistic material, and realise the ideal of sensuous plasticity which was
          ever before his eyes. In this work the relief has been superseded by the statue; and they
          are statues, these, which impress us with the feeling that Michael Angelo's chisel must
          have played a part in their production. Granted that the influence of Milton is clearly
          perceptible–there is more than Milton here. The nature of the subject demanded the
          colossal.</p>

        <p>We are told of the goddess Thea:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»By her in stature the tall Amazon</l>
          <l>Had stood a pigmy's height; she would have ta'en</l>
          <l>Achilles by the hair and bent his neck;</l>
          <l>Or with a finger stay'd Ixion's wheel.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>And read this description of the cavern where the Titans are assembled after their
          fall:–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»It was a den where no insulting light</l>
          <l>Could glimmer on their tears; where their own groans</l>

          <l>Of thunderous waterfalls and torrents hoarse,</l>
          <l>Pouring a constant bulk, uncertain where.</l>
          <l>Crag jutting forth to crag, and rocks that seem'd</l>

          <l>And thus in thousand hugest phantasies</l>
          <l>Made a fit roofing to this nest of woe.</l>
          <l>Instead of thrones, hard flint they sat upon,</l>
          <l>Couches of rugged stone, and slaty ridge</l>
          <l>Stubborn'd with iron. All were not assembled:</l>
          <l>Some chain'd in torture, and some wandering.</l>
          <l>Cæus, and Gyges, and Briareüs,</l>
          <l>Typhon, and Dolor, and Porphyrion,</l>
          <l>With many more, the brawniest in assault,</l>
          <l>Were pent in regions of laborious breath;</l>
          <l>Dungeon'd in opaque element, to keep</l>
          <l>Their clenchèd teeth still clench'd, and all their limbs</l>
          <l>Locked up like veins of metal, crampt and screw'd;</l>
          <l>Without a motion, save of their big hearts</l> 
          <l>Heaving in pain, and horribly convuls'd</l>
          <l>With sanguine feverous boiling gurge of pulse.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>Byron, who had been very severe in his criticism of Keats's previous works, said, and
          said truly, of <emph>Hyperion</emph>: »It seems actually inspired by the Titans, and is as sublime as
          Æschylus.«</p>

        <p>The specimens of his poetry here quoted afford sufficient proof of Keats's imaginative
          power. It is to it, and not to his melodies, sweet as they are, that he owes his rank
          among English poets.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">
            Note the melodiousness of the Fairy Song:

          The purely artistic character of his verse makes of him the
          connecting link between the conservative and the progressive poets. He has a distinct bias
          in the direction of progress. Of this his enthusiastic friendship for the Radical editor
          of the <emph>Examiner</emph>, Leigh Hunt, is a striking proof. He felt what he wrote when, in his
          indignation at the proceedings of the Liverpool-Castlereagh ministry, he exclaimed (in his
          poem <emph>To Hope</emph>):</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»O, let me see our land retain her soul,</l>
          <l>Her pride, her freedom; and not freedom's shade!«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>And William Tell, Wallace, and, chief of all, Kosciuszko, are named again and again in
          his verse with the profoundest <pb n="146"/> admiration. What he might have developed into if he had
          reached maturity, it is impossible to tell. When he wrote his last poems he was still but
          a child, ignorant of the world.</p>

        <p>And it must not be forgotten that while he wrote them he was enduring great physical
          suffering, and mental anxiety amounting to torture. Perhaps it is for this very reason
          they are so beautiful. Let the artist keep his private life long enough out of his
          work–let him, like Keats, hardly make any allusion in his poetry to his most absorbing
          passion–and no work will have such life, such colour, such divine fire as that executed
          whilst he not only wrought, but lived and suffered. Neither the precariousness of Keats's
          circumstances, nor his hopeless state of health, nor his passion for Fanny Brawne, set any
          distinct mark on his poetry; but from all this poison for himself he drew nourishment for
          it.</p>

        <p>He sank into his early grave, but hardly had the earth closed over him before he rose
          again from the dead in Shelley's great elegy. He ceased to exist as Keats; he was
          transformed into a myth, into Adonais, into the beloved of all the Muses and the elements;
          and henceforward he had, as it were, a double existence in the consciousness of the
          age.</p>

        <p>We search the history of literature in vain for a parallel to this elegy. It is instant
          transfiguration after death–a poetic transfiguration of a purely naturalistic and purely
          human kind. To Shelley, Keats's true apotheosis was what he expresses in the words: »He is

        <head><pb n="[148]"/> XII. THE POETRY OF IRISH OPPOSITION AND REVOLT</head>

        <p>In November 1825 Sir Walter Scott writes in his diary: »I saw Moore ... There is a manly
          frankness and perfect ease and good breeding about him which is delightful. Not the least
          touch of the poet or the pedant ... His countenance is decidedly plain, but the expression
          is so very animated, especially in speaking or singing, that it is far more interesting
          than the finest features could have rendered it. I was aware that Byron had often spoken,
          both in private society and his Journal, of Moore and myself in the same breath, and with
          the same sort of regard; so I was curious to see what there could be in common betwixt us,
          Moore having lived so much in the gay world, I in the country and with people of business,
          and sometimes with politicians; Moore a scholar, I none; he a musician and artist, I
          without knowledge of a note; he a democrat, I an aristocrat–with many other points of
          difference; besides his being an Irishman, I a Scotchman, and both tolerably national. Yet
          there is a point of resemblance, and a strong one. We are both good-humoured fellows, who
          rather seek to enjoy what is going forward than to maintain our dignity as lions; and we
          have both seen the world too widely and too well not to contemn in our souls the imaginary
          consequence of literary people, who walk with their noses in the air, and remind me always
          of the fellow whom Johnson met in an alehouse, and who called himself 'the <emph>great</emph>
          Twalmley–inventor of the floodgate iron for smoothing linen.' ... It would be a
          delightful addition to life if T. M. had a cottage within two miles of one.–We went to
          the theatre together, and the house, being luckily a good one, received T. M. with <pb n="149"/> rapture. I could have hugged them, for it paid back the debt of the kind reception I met
          with in Ireland.«</p>

        <p>In these cordial words the great Scottish author compares himself with the Irish national
          poet. The resemblance between their position, as recognised and highly esteemed organs of
          the two dependent countries united to England, makes the difference between them the more
          clearly perceptible. There is, first of all, the dissimilarity produced by the dissimilar
          relations of Scotland and Ireland to the dominant race. Scotland's position was a
          subordinate one, but it was legally established, and the country sent representatives to
          Parliament. The Irish, on the other hand, divided by a much more marked difference of
          race, and, as regarded the majority, of religion, from their English masters, had been for
          six centuries under the rule of a Government in which they had no more share than have the
          Hindoos or the Cingalese in theirs. The Protestant Irish Parliament existed in its day in
          Ireland like a hostile garrison in a conquered country. It was a body of absolute rulers,
          governing and oppressing in the name of a foreign power; any attempt at opposition on the
          part of its members was at once put a stop to either by bribery or force. The Irish
          Protestant was not in reality in a better position than his Catholic fellow-countryman; he
          could purchase the favour of his masters only by sacrificing the interests of his country,
          and enjoyed only the one pitiful privilege of being at the same time vassal and
          master.</p>

        <p>It has been a fortunate thing for the English people that their faults as well as their
          virtues have ensured them success in the struggle for political independence and power;
          their egoism and their pride have been of almost as much service to them as their sober
          sagacity and their energy. The Irish, on the other hand, seem, like the Poles, to be
          condemned both by their virtues and their vices to political subordination. Even making
          allowance for the fact that the character of the conquered race is invariably maligned in
          the descriptions of it given by the conqueror, it must be granted that the sprightliness,
          ardour, and charm of the Irish, their turbulent bravery, their fitful chivalry, <pb n="150"/> their
          independent and, under certain conditions, rebellious tendencies, co-existing with a love
          of the pomp and splendour of royalty, form a bad foundation for a tranquil and independent
          existence as a state. The virtues of the Irish are not the modern, civic virtues, but
          those of an earlier age–their piety verges on the blindest superstition; their fidelity
          consists, like that of their Breton brothers, in a kind of vassal-fealty to the old
          nobility of the country, and their splendid bravery is of an undisciplined, impetuous
          nature. Long-continued oppression has, moreover, set its imprint on their souls. They lack
          self-confidence, and have a tendency to dissimulation and to indolence; they are too
          reckless of danger and too easily intimidated when brought face to face with it; they
          cannot, when liberty is granted them for a short time, make a good use of it, this being
          an art which can only be learned by long practice.</p>

        <p>There are inexperienced races just as there are inexperienced individuals. One side of
          the Irish character has a strong resemblance to the French (and the Irish have always had
          a warm sympathy for the French), another reminds us of the Polish character, and there is
          a third which is almost Oriental. In a poem entitled »The Parallel« (one of the <emph>Irish
          Melodies</emph>), which Moore composed in answer to an anti-Irish pamphlet written to prove that
          the Irish were originally Jews, he compares the fate of the two nations:–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Like thee doth our nation lie conquer'd and broken,</l>
          <l>And fall'n from her head is the once royal crown;</l>
          <l>In her streets, in her halls, desolation hath spoken,</l>
          <l>And 'while it is day yet, her sun hath gone down.'«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>

        <p>And there undoubtedly is an Oriental quality in the race. Byron, writing of Moore, says
          that the wildness, tenderness, and originality of the Irish–the magnificent and fiery
          spirit of the men, the beauty and feeling of the women, are the best proofs of the
          Oriental descent which they claim. A race with such a character necessarily fell an easy
          prey to a determined, cruel English despotism.</p><!-- Illustration: THOMAS MOORE -->

        <p><pb n="151"/> A hasty glance at the history of Ireland during Thomas Moore's youth will help us to
          understand how this man with the gentle nature and the sweet lyric gift was the first to
          rouse English poetry from its engrossed preoccupation with nature, to impress it into the
          service of liberty, and to give the start to political poetry.</p>

        <p>Moore was born in May 1779. The years of his early youth were the period of the revolting
          events now to be related. From the time when the English Government showed, by the
          appointment of Lord Camden as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (1795), that it had abandoned the
          humaner policy of 1782, the Society of United Irishmen, a powerful political organisation,
          which had hitherto aimed at the emancipation of the country by lawful means, completely
          changed its character. The separation of Ireland from England became its aim; it had
          dreams of the establishment of an Irish Republic. But there were two powerful elements of
          dissension in the country itself, namely, the existence of two races, hostile to each
          other, and the strong animosity in the lower classes between Protestants and Catholics. To
          put an end to the disturbances and riots which were constantly resulting from these
          internal dissensions, the Government formed a force of Protestant constabulary, 37,000
          strong. These troops were permitted, under the pretence of searching for concealed
          weapons, to capture, torture, and put to death any unfortunate person whom an enemy, or
          any ruffian whatever, chose to accuse of suspicious behaviour. Hundreds of unoffending
          people, who were guilty of no other offence than professing the creed of their fathers,
          were flogged until they were insensible, or made to stand upon one foot on a pointed
          stake, or were half hanged, or had the scalp torn from their heads by a pitched cap.
          Militia and yeomanry, as well as the regular troops, were billeted in private houses; and
          this billet appears to have been construed as an unlimited license for robbery,
          devastation, ravishment, and, in case of resistance, murder. It was boasted by officers of
          rank that within certain large districts no home had been left undefiled; and upon its
          being remarked that the sex must have been <pb n="152"/> very complying, the reply was that »the bayonet
          removed all squeamishness.«<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Massey: <emph>History of England</emph>, iv. 302. The whole account is founded upon descriptions
            given by <emph>English patriots</emph>.</note></p>

        <p>It was not surprising that the despair induced by such proceedings drove numbers of the
          most peaceable and sensible Irishmen into the arms of a secret society, which sent Lord
          Edward Fitzgerald (whose biography Moore wrote with such warm admiration) as its deputy to
          France, to arrange with General Hoche for the landing of a French army in Ireland at the
          time appointed for a general rising of the Irish rebels. Grattan, the old, passionless
          leader of the national party, refused to countenance foreign interference, and retired
          from public life in despair over the latest plans both of the rulers and the oppressed.
          The Irish patriots elected a governing body, a species of Directoire, which was
          negotiating with France for the loan of money and troops, when all its plans were
          discomfited by the treason of a single Catholic Irishman. His name, which deserves to be
          remembered, was Reynolds. Moore undoubtedly had this man in his mind when he wrote the
          description, in <emph>The Fire-worshippers</emph>, of the base betrayal of the rebel chief to the
          Mohammedans.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom"><emph>Lalla Rookh: The Fire-worshippers</emph>.</note></p>

        <p>Lord Edward Fitzgerald was in bed when the soldiers forced their way into the house where
          he lay hidden. A reward of £1000 had been offered for his head. Although undressed, and
          with no weapon but a sword, he defended himself for a long time against three fully armed
          English officers, of whom one received three and another fourteen wounds; the third
          disarmed him with a pistol-shot, and he was taken to prison. Fitzgerald was acquainted
          with the most distinguished of the French revolutionists; he was a friend of Thomas Paine;
          and his wife was a charming daughter of Philippe Egalité. He carried on a steady
          correspondence with France; and had he not died in prison, he would have been executed. It
          speaks well for Moore's courage and independent judgment, that, though he belonged to a
          circle in which Fitzgerald was regarded as <pb n="153"/> a traitorous madman, he paid him all the honour
          due to his heroism.</p>

        <p>The rebels having thus lost their leader, the prospect of a general rising was at an end;
          but the Government took the opportunity to treat persons suspected of sedition with a
          cruelty bordering on frenzy. Martial law was proclaimed, and those employed to administer
          it are described by English historians as »a set of ignorant, bloodthirsty ruffians, who
          first, by torture and promises of pardon, converted Catholic prisoners into witnesses
          against the accused, and then treated them in the most shameful manner.« The first notable
          man who fell a victim to this species of justice was a peaceable member of the party which
          desired reform by lawful means, Sir Edward Crosbie. He was hanged, and his body mutilated
          afterwards. It was not the difference of religion which excited the cruel passions of
          these torturers, for all the best leaders of the United Irishmen (Fitzgerald, O'Connor,
          Harvey, Thomas Emmet) were Protestants, who unselfishly embraced the cause of their
          Catholic countrymen; it was the Anglo-Saxons' old race-hatred of the Celts.</p>

        <p>The Government chose as its chief tool a man who was known to be such an ignorant,
          ferocious partisan that any degree of violence might be expected of him. This was Thomas
          Judkin Fitzgerald, a small proprietor, who in 1799 was appointed High Sheriff. His plan of
          ingratiating himself with his employers was to seize persons whom he chose to suspect,
          and, by dint of the lash and threats of instant death, to extort confessions of guilt and
          accusations of other persons. So abject was the terror of the peasantry who were abandoned
          to the mercy of this miscreant, that they fell on their knees before him. I give two
          examples of his manner of proceeding, chosen from the many which were made public during
          the lawsuit brought against him for having abused his authority–the result of which was,
          of course, his acquittal with honour.</p>

        <p>He received a poor teacher of languages (Wright by name), who, hearing that he was
          »suspected,« had come to the court-house of his own accord, with the order to fall upon
          his knees and receive his sentence. »You are a <pb n="154"/> rebel,« said the Sheriff, »and a principal
          in this rebellion. You are to receive five hundred lashes, and then to be shot.« The poor
          man begged for time, and was so rash as to ask for a trial. This aroused Fitzgerald to
          fury, and Wright was hurried to the flogging-ladders. Fitzgerald himself dragged his
          fainting victim by the hair, kicked him, and slashed him with a sword. Fifty lashes had
          been inflicted, when an English Major came up and asked what Wright had done. The Sheriff
          answered by flinging him a note, taken from Wright's pocket. It was in French, a language
          of which Fitzgerald was wholly ignorant, and proved to be an excuse for inability to
          fulfil a professional engagement. Major Riall assured Fitzgerald that the note was
          perfectly harmless; nevertheless the lash continued to descend until the victim's entrails
          were visible through the flayed flesh. The hangman was then ordered to apply his thongs to
          a part of the body which had not yet been torn.</p>

        <p>This case of Wright's was one of those which created the greatest sensation during the
          proceedings against the Irish High Sheriff. But »the trial,« says Massey, »would not have
          been complete had not an Orange parson been called on the part of the defendant to swear
          that this notorious bloodshedder, who throughout Ireland was called 'flogging Fitzgerald,'
          was a mild and humane man.« The fact that the Government, contrary to the principles of
          the constitution, had given a special permission at the time of his appointment for the
          employment of torture, made it easy for him to triumph over all his denouncers. Addressing
          the jury as defendant, he actually boasted of having flogged several persons under
          circumstances more aggravated than those before the court. He mentioned one man who had
          cut his throat to escape the horrors and ignominy of torture. It remains to be told that
          Judkin Fitzgerald received a special pension as reward of his services, and was, after the
          Union, made a baron of the United Kingdom.</p>

        <p>One more specimen of the proceedings during the suppression of the rebellion must be
          given; it furnishes an idea of the impressions received by Moore during the years when he
          was ripening into manhood.–»A part of the Mount <pb n="155"/> Kennedy corps of yeomanry were, on an
          autumn night in the year 1798, patrolling the village of Delbarg, in the county of
          Wicklow. Two or three of the party, led by Whollaghan, one of their number, entered the
          cottage of a labouring man named Dogherty, and demanded if there were any bloody rebels
          there. The only inmates of the cabin were Dogherty's wife, and a sick lad, her son, who
          was eating his supper. Whollaghan asked if the boy was Dogherty's son, and, being told
          that he was–'Then, you dog,' said Whollaghan, 'you are to die here.' 'I hope not,'
          answered the poor lad; and begged, if there were any charge against him, that he might be
          tried. Whollaghan, with a volley of abuse, raised his gun and pulled the trigger twice,
          but the piece missed fire. A comrade then handed him another gun; and the mother rushed at
          the muzzle to shield her son. In the struggle the piece went off, and the ball broke young
          Dogherty's arm. When the boy fell, the assassins left the cabin; but Whollaghan returned,
          and seeing the lad supported by his mother, he cried out: 'Is not the dog dead yet?' 'O
          yes, sir,' cried the poor woman, 'he is dead enough.' 'For fear he is not,' said
          Whollaghan, 'let him take this.' And with deliberate aim he fired a fourth time, and
          Dogherty dropped dead out of his mother's arms. Whollaghan was tried for murder. The real
          defence was that the prisoner and his companions had been sent out with general orders
          from their officer to shoot any one they pleased. The court seem to have been of opinion
          that such orders were neither unusual nor unreasonable. They found 'that the prisoner did
          shoot and kill one Thomas Dogherty, a rebel'; but acquitted him of any malicious or wilful
          intention of murder.«</p>

        <p>It was by means such as these that tranquillity was restored in Ireland, and that its
          people were ripened for the great administrative change in which Castlereagh's cold,
          diplomatic keen-sightedness saw the one chance of escape from the Irish deadlock, namely,
          the discontinuance of the independent Irish Parliament which held its sessions in Dublin,
          and its incorporation with the Parliament meeting in London. The only opposition which
          required to be overcome was that of the Irish Parliament itself, which, <pb n="156"/> corrupt as it was,
          was not yet pliable enough. Castlereagh, who was Secretary of State for Ireland, and who
          does not seem in his capacity of Protestant Irishman to have had a particularly high
          opinion of his Protestant countrymen, had recourse to the simple expedient of purchasing
          one by one a sufficient number of the votes of the Opposition. In every official letter
          which he wrote to the Government at home between the beginning of 1799 and the
          accomplishment of the Union in 1800, he insisted on the necessity of bribery; and he
          received the Government's answer in the shape of one million five hundred thousand pounds,
          of which he made the best possible use. In their despair, the few patriots in the
          Parliament resolved to try the only expedient which they thought likely to be of any
          avail; they arranged that Grattan, who was still idolised by the nation, but who had long
          kept silence and was now dangerously ill, should suddenly appear in Parliament in the
          middle of the debate on the Union. The scene was arranged with the Irish love of dramatic
          effect. A vacancy having occurred a few days before the meeting of Parliament in the
          representation of Wicklow, an arrangement was made with Mr. Tighe, the patron of the
          borough, to return Grattan. Tighe himself took the return, and, riding all night, arrived
          in Dublin at five o'clock in the morning. Grattan, wasted by sickness, was taken out of
          bed, dressed, wrapped in a blanket, and conveyed in a sedan chair to the Parliament House.
          At seven in the morning, when the jaded House was half asleep, the speech of an orator
          named Egan was interrupted by the voice of the Speaker summoning a new member to the table
          to take the oaths. The House started from its slumber as the spectral figure of Grattan
          paced slowly up the floor. The man of 1782, the champion of the revolution which had made
          Ireland a nation, had come back as from the grave to rescue the independence of his
          country. He concluded his speech with the words: »Against such a proposition, were I
          expiring on the floor, I should beg to utter my last breath and record my dying
          testimony.« When Corry, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, dared to reply to these words
          with an accusation of treason, Grattan answered with a challenge. <pb n="157"/> A few days afterwards
          they fought a duel with pistols; Corry, fortunately for himself, was wounded in the arm;
          had he been the victor, he would undoubtedly have been torn in pieces by the mob.</p>

        <p>But even Grattan was powerless against the weapons employed by the Government. The
          eloquence, the brilliancy and solidity of which were compared by Moore to those of a
          precious gem, and which Byron declared to be superior to that of Demosthenes, found no
          echo.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">

          </note> The day the Union was decided on, the galleries were crowded with an anxious,
          excited audience. But Castlereagh, who felt assured of success, awaited the result with a
          smile on his lips. When the time for voting came, the Speaker, dwelling on the words,
          said: »All who desire the Union hold up their hands!« Member after member slowly and
          shamefacedly raised his hand. For a moment the Speaker stood as still as a statue; then
          crying: »The Union is carried!« he threw himself on his chair with a gesture of disgust
          and anger. During this stormy debate, in the course of which the most notable Irishmen of
          the day proclaimed opposition and rebellion at the present juncture to be a duty–none of
          them, however, with any intention of carrying their principles into action–there sat in
          one of the galleries a youth with a pale face and sparkling eyes, who meant all that the
          others only said, and swore in his heart that he would be the liberator of his country.
          This young man was Ireland's best and noblest son, Robert Emmet, the friend who, in all
          probability, inspired Thomas Moore with most of the force and fire to be found in the
          enchanting <emph>Irish Melodies</emph>.</p>

        <p><pb n="158"/> The notable Irish poet who came into the world in the same year as our Danish poet,
          Oehlenschläger, was the son of a Dublin wine-merchant. He had a good father and an
          affectionate, capable mother, and spent a happy childhood in the bosom of his family. He
          very early showed himself to be an unusually clever and talented boy; he acted, wrote and
          recited poetry, and sang with a peculiarly sweet voice, which he retained all his life. In
          reading his own account of his boyhood, we observe how early his peculiar poetic gift,
          which was that of the improvisatore and singer, the lyrist proper, reveals itself. He
          possessed the same talent which distinguished Bellmann, the Swede, that of fusing words
          and music together into a whole; and along with this, he had the actor's and singer's
          power of moving by his interpretation. He was short, considerably under middle height; his
          brown hair curled close to his head, and in his childhood he resembled a little Cupid. His
          forehead was large and radiant, so interesting that it must have been the delight of
          phrenologists. He had beautiful, dark eyes–the kind of eyes, says Leigh Hunt, which we
          think of surmounted by a wreath of vine leaves–a refined, merry mouth, a dimpled chin, a
          sensual nose, slightly turned up, as if it were inhaling the fragrance of a feast or an
          orchard. The little man as a whole produced an impression of vitality and energy; he was
          of the stuff to have made a fiery raider of the old Irish type; he was always
          high-spirited, and in his younger days so quick-tempered that he challenged Jeffrey on
          account of the latter's first review of his poetry, and afterwards Byron for jeering (in
          <emph>English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</emph>) at the bloodless endeavour at a duel which was the
          result of the first challenge.</p>

        <p>In spite, however, of this martial element in his disposition, it is highly probable that
          Moore, if he had lived at a less critical, distressing period, and had not come into
          personal contact with tyranny and oppression, would never have risen to a higher rank as
          poet than that of the sweet Anacreontic singer. His temperament inclined him in this
          direction. But it was vouchsafed to him to do more for his <pb n="159"/> country than ever man had done
          for it before, more even than Burns had done for Scotland, namely, to knit its name, its
          memories, its sufferings, the shameful injustice done it, and the most admirable qualities
          of its sons and daughters, to imperishable poetry and music.</p>

        <p>At the early age of fifteen Moore was entered as a student at the University of Dublin.
          The political leaven which was beginning to leaven the whole of Ireland had penetrated the
          walls of the University. A young man, destined to a great and tragic fate, was attracting
          the attention both of his fellow-students and the professors. This was the Robert Emmet
          already alluded to, a youth of singular purity of character, who at the age of sixteen was
          already a distinguished student of mathematics and physics, and a political orator of the
          first rank. His speeches at the meetings of the »Historical Society,« and the deep
          impression made by them on Moore, a lad of his own age, but of a much weaker and less
          developed character, have already been mentioned. Although he had been warned against
          allowing himself to be seen in the streets with Emmet, Moore was soon connected with him
          by the ties of warm admiration and close friendship. And little wonder! It was the Irish
          national hero whom the Irish poet had met, in the springtide of their youth. Neither of
          them had any prevision of the other's future greatness, but the instinct which unites
          harmonious minds kept them together long enough for the poet to receive his consecration
          from the hero. »Were I to number,« says Moore, »the men among all I have ever known, who
          appeared to me to combine in the greatest degree pure moral worth with intellectual power,
          I should, among the highest of the few, place Robert Emmet.«<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Thomas Moore: <emph>Memoirs of Lord Edward Fitzgerald</emph>.</note></p>

        <p>Robert Emmet was born in 1780. His elder brother, Thomas, was one of the leaders of the
          rebellion of 1798, and, after its failure, was first imprisoned and then banished.
          Robert's earliest emotions were hatred of English tyranny and love of the Irish martyrs.
          Even as a boy he displayed a strength of character which foreshadowed the greatness of
          soul that he displayed as a man. At the age of twelve he was already <pb n="160"/> absorbed in the study
          of mathematics and chemistry.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Madden: <emph>The United Irishmen, Their Lives and Times</emph>.</note> One day, immediately after making a chemical experiment,
          he sat down to solve a difficult mathematical problem, and, absently putting his hand to
          his mouth, poisoned himself with a corrosive sublimate which he had been handling a few
          moments before. The violent pains which he immediately felt, informed him of his danger.
          The fear of being forbidden to make such dangerous experiments in future led him to
          suppress anything of the nature of a cry. He went downstairs to his father's library,
          looked up the article on »Poison« in an encyclopædia, and found that chalk was recommended
          as an antidote in such cases as his. Remembering that he had seen a piece of chalk in the
          coach-house, he went there, broke open the door, which was locked, found the chalk,
          prepared and drank a solution of it, and returned to his mathematical problem. He appeared
          at breakfast next morning with a face so altered that it was hardly recognisable, and then
          confessed to his tutor that he had suffered excruciating tortures during the night, but
          added that one good result of his sleeplessness was that he had solved his problem.</p>

        <p>A boy with courage and composure of this quality was sure to grow into a man with a
          powerful influence over others.</p>

        <p>One of those whom Emmet influenced most strongly was Thomas Moore. The simplicity of
          appearance and manner which, in combination with the most delicate consideration for
          others, distinguished the young politician, changed, when the spring was touched that set
          his feelings, and through them, his intellect in motion, into an air of intellectual
          nobility and superiority which enchained the sympathy of the poet to be. »No two
          individuals,« writes Moore, »could be much more unlike to each other, than was the same
          youth to himself, before rising to speak, and after;–the brow that had appeared
          inanimate, and almost drooping, at once elevating itself to all the consciousness of
          power, and the whole countenance and figure of the speaker assuming a change as of one
          suddenly inspired. Of his <pb n="161"/> oratory, it must be recollected, I speak after youthful
          impressions; but I have heard little, since, that appeared to me of a loftier or purer
          character.« Moore further asserts that Emmet's influence over his surroundings was due
          quite as much to the blamelessness of his life and the grave suavity of his manners as to
          his scientific attainments and his eloquence.</p>

        <p>In 1797 a newspaper named <emph>The Press</emph> was started by the brothers Emmet, O'Connor, and
          other Irish popular leaders; and Moore was not a little eager to see something of his own
          in its patriotic and widely-read columns. But his mother's constant anxiety about him made
          him fearful of hazarding anything that might agitate her, so he resolved to write
          anonymously, at any rate to begin with. He sent in an imitation of Ossian, which was
          printed, but excited no attention. Then, with trembling hand, he entrusted to the post a
          <emph>Letter to the Students of Trinity College</emph>, which, as he himself observes, was richly
          seasoned with treason; it was a witty satire on Castlereagh, who, as long as he lived, was
          the butt of Moore's wit.</p>

        <p>»I hardly expected,« writes Moore, »that it would make its appearance; but, lo and
          behold, on the next evening of publication, when seated, as usual, in my little corner by
          the fire, I unfolded the paper for the purpose of reading it to my father and mother,
          there was my own letter staring me full in the face, occupying a conspicuous station in
          the paper, and, of course, one of the first and principal things that my auditors wished
          to hear.« Overcoming his emotion, he read the letter aloud, and had the gratification of
          hearing it much praised by his parents, who, however, pronounced both language and
          sentiments to be »very bold«. On the following day, Edward Hudson, the only friend
          entrusted with the secret, paid a morning call, and had not been long in the room
          conversing with Mrs. Moore, when he looked significantly at Tom and remarked: »Well, you
          saw–.« »That letter was yours, then, Tom?« cried the mother; and new entreaties to be
          cautious followed on Tom's confession.</p>

        <p>»A few days after,« writes Moore, »in the course of one of those strolls into the country
          which Emmet and I used <pb n="162"/> often to take together, our conversation turned upon this letter,
          and I gave him to understand that it was mine; when with that almost feminine gentleness
          of manner which he possessed, and which is so often found in such determined spirits, he
          owned to me that on reading the letter, though pleased with its contents, he could not
          help regretting that the public attention had thus been called to the politics of the
          University, as it might have the effect of awakening the vigilance of the college
          authorities, and frustrate the progress of the good work (as we both considered it) which
          was going on there so quietly. Even then, boyish as my own mind was, I could not help
          being struck with the manliness of the view which I saw he took of what men ought to do in
          such times and circumstances, namely, not to <emph>talk</emph> or <emph>write</emph> about their intentions, but
          to <emph>act</emph>. He had never before, I think, in conversation with me, alluded to the existence
          of the United Irish societies, in college, nor did he now, or at any subsequent time, make
          any proposition to me to join in them, a forbearance which I attribute a good deal to his
          knowledge of the watchful anxiety about me which prevailed at home.... He was altogether a
          noble fellow, and as full of imagination and tenderness of heart as of manly daring.«</p>

        <p>It is plain enough that Robert Emmet, though he was sincerely attached to Moore, felt
          that he was not of the stuff of which a man must be made who is to stake his future and
          his life on the success of a rebellion. But he had a high opinion of the young poet, and
          often sought his society; he was doubtless conscious of the resonance of his own ideas and
          dreams in the harp of Moore's soul. He used frequently to sit by him at the pianoforte
          whilst he played over the airs from Bunting's Irish collection; and Moore as an old man
          still remembered how one day, when he was playing the spirited air, »Let Erin remember the
          day!« Emmet exclaimed passionately: »Oh that I were at the head of twenty thousand men
          marching to that air!«</p>

        <p>This was in 1797, shortly before the discovery of the great Irish conspiracy. The
          discovery came, with all its attendant horrors. One of its first results was a regular
          court of inquisition, held within the walls of the University. The <pb n="163"/> roll was called, and
          the students were examined one by one. Most of them knew little or nothing about the plot,
          but there were a few, among them Robert Emmet, whose absence revealed to their comrades
          how much they had known of the betrayed and defeated plans. The dead silence which
          followed the daily calling out of their names made a profound impression on Moore. He
          himself proved at this trial what a high-spirited little fellow he was; he told the
          dreaded Lord Fitzgibbon to his face that, in taking the oath demanded of him, he reserved
          to himself the power of refusing to answer any question calculated to get a comrade into
          trouble; and he bore with manly composure the outburst of anger which followed. As he was
          not a member of the Society of United Irishmen, and had evidently no knowledge of their
          plans, he was dismissed at once.</p>

        <p>It was during the years immediately following this incident that Moore began to appear
          before the public as a poet. The horrors attendant on the suppression of the rebellion did
          not provide him with any of his themes; they were still too near. Emmet was away, and his
          influence in abeyance; and, indeed, political poetry was for the moment an impossibility
          in Ireland. So the young poet, whose temperament naturally inclined him in the direction
          of light, sprightly verse, followed the course prescribed by his tastes and his age. He
          prepared an English version of the Odes of Anacreon, which he published before he was
          twenty, with a dedication to the Prince Regent, who was at that time the hope of the
          Liberals; and in 1801 he published, under the title of <emph>Poetical Works of the late Thomas
          Little, Esq</emph>., a volume of poems, for the most part of an erotic, youthfully sensuous, and
          slightly licentious character. The Irish licentiousness reminds one of that which is not
          at all uncommon in Swedish erotic poetry; it has also, like the Swedish, a national
          stamp.</p>

        <p>After leading a tolerably aimless existence for a year or two in London, where his
          talents and his Irish charm of manner made him a favourite in the best society, Moore was
          obliged by his poverty to go as Admiralty Registrar (a post procured for him by Lord
          Moira) to the Bermudas. It was, <pb n="164"/> as one can easily imagine, an appointment very unsuited to
          his tastes, and after a short time he entrusted his duties to a deputy, made a tour in
          America, and returned to England. The deputy, in course of time, embezzled a considerable
          sum of Government money, and thus Moore, like Scott, became responsible for the payment of
          a heavy debt. He also, like Scott, received numerous offers of assistance; and he
          discharged his liabilities, partly with the assistance of wealthy friends, partly by his
          own industry and strict economy for several years. His tour in America lasted from October
          1803 to November 1804. He brought home with him the American Epistles, and poems which are
          to be found in the second volume of his works, and which contain descriptions of nature as
          remarkable for their correctness as for their wealth of glowing colour. With his genuine
          English Naturalism, he was, however, more anxious to be truthful than to be brilliant, and
          was very proud of the many testimonies he received both from natives and travellers as to
          the correct impression he conveyed of country and people. The well-known English
          traveller, Captain Basil Hall (who visited Scott at Abbotsford and who, when ill in
          Venice, was taken care of by Byron), asserts that Moore's Odes and Epistles give the most
          beautiful and correct description of Bermuda that is to be found; and he draws attention
          to the fact that both the words and tune of the prettiest of the songs, the »Canadian Boat
          Song,« are close imitations of what one actually hears in the boats out there, the poet
          having, however, rejected whatever was neither beautiful nor characteristic. Moore himself
          tells how exactly he kept to reality in his descriptions of landscapes and even trees.
          Referring to the lines:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»'Twas thus, by the shade of a calabash-tree,</l>
          <l>With a few who could love and remember like me,«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>

        <p>he relates how, twenty-five years after writing them, he received from Bermuda a cup made
          from a shell of the fruit of the identical calabash tree alluded to, on the bark of which
          his name had been found inscribed. The unaccustomed natural surroundings of these regions
          had a fecundating effect on the <pb n="165"/> mind of a young poet who was susceptible to luxurious,
          festal impressions. The democratic and republican institutions of the United States were
          much less to the taste of the refined writer on whom the general reaction against the
          eighteenth century, which was now beginning, was already producing its effect. His
          Epistles on the state of society in America prove that he was alive only to the defects of
          the Republic. He had an audience of the President; but we perceive that Jefferson's
          slovenly dress–slippers and blue stockings formed part of it–gave the young poet an
          unfavourable impression of the man who had drawn up the Declaration of Independence. What
          shocked him more than anything else in America was to find French philosophy, which he,
          the true child of his day, regarded as sinful and poisonous, so widely spread throughout
          the young republic.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">

          </note> He referred many years afterwards to this time as being the one
          period during which he had felt doubtful of the wisdom of the liberal political faith in
          which he might almost literally be said to have begun his life, and in which he expected
          to end it.</p>

        <p>It almost seemed, for a moment, as if the impressions received by the poet in his
          oppressed native island during his childhood and youth were extinct, dead and buried under
          Anacreontic sentiments, reminiscences of travel, and the pleasures of life as lived in the
          most fashionable and frivolous circles of London society. But in 1807 appeared the first
          Number of the <emph>Irish Melodies</emph>, the work which is Moore's title-deed to immortality.
          Everything that his unfortunate country had felt and suffered during the long years of her
          ignominy–her agonies and sighs, her ardent struggles, her martial spirit, the smile
          shining through her tears–we have them all here, scattered about in songs which are
          written in a mood of half-gay, half-mournful levity and amorousness. <pb n="166"/> It was a wreath this,
          woven of grief, enthusiasm, and tenderness, a fragrant wreath, such as one binds in honour
          of the dead, which Moore placed on his country's brow. Not that Ireland is often
          mentioned; there are as few names as possible in these poems–it was not safe to print
          Irish names. But now the singer would celebrate his mistress in such terms that no one
          could fail to recognise her as Erin, now the dearly beloved would speak with a majesty
          which showed her to be no mortal woman; and, as in the old Christian allegorical hymns,
          the mysticism increased the poetic effect.</p>

        <p>What had happened in the interval between the appearance of Moore's wanton, frivolous
          poetry and the conception of these wonderful songs? They themselves answer the question by
          suppressing the answer. The fourth Melody begins:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Oh, breathe not his name, let it sleep in the shade,</l>
          <l>Where cold and unhonoured his relics are laid:</l>
          <l>Sad, silent, and dark be the tears that we shed,</l>
          <l>As the night-dew that falls on the grass o'er his head!«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>

        <p>There was, then, one whose name might not be named, whose body lay dishonoured in a grave
          where it might be wept over only in the darkness of night.</p>

        <p>In the next song, again without any mention of a name, we read:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»When he who adores thee has left but the name</l>
          <l>Of his fault and his sorrows behind,</l>
          <l>Oh! say, wilt thou weep when they darken the fame</l>
          <l>Of a life that for thee was resigned?</l>
          <l>Yes, weep, and however my foes may condemn,</l>
          <l>Thy tears shall efface their decree;</l>
          <l>For Heaven can witness, though guilty to them,</l>
          <l>I have been but too faithful to thee!«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>That the beloved of these lines is Ireland, we can see at the first glance; but once more
          a dark veil of anonymity is cast over the man whose reputation was destroyed by his
          enemies, but who, though declared guilty by them, had been so faithful to the object of
          his worship.</p>

        <p><pb n="167"/> Let the reader turn over a few pages, and he will come upon a poem which is closely
          connected with the two just quoted. It is a sweet, sad portrait of the betrothed of the
          anonymous dead hero.</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>

          <l>For her heart in his grave is lying.</l></lg>

        <lg><l>She sings the wild songs of her dear native plains,</l>
          <l>Every note that he loved awaking.–</l>
          <l>Ah! little they think, who delight in her strains,</l>
          <l>How the heart of the Minstrel is breaking!</l></lg>

        <lg>
          <l>He had lived for her love, for his country he died,</l>
          <l>They were all that to life had entwined him;</l>
          <l>Nor soon shall the tears of his country be dried,</l>
          <l>Nor long will his love stay behind him.</l></lg>

        <lg>
          <l>Oh! make her a grave where the sunbeams rest,</l>
          <l>When they promise a glorious morrow;</l>
          <l>They'll shine o'er her sleep, like a smile from the West,</l>
          <l>From her own loved Island of Sorrow!«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>The reader has already divined that the young hero of these touching laments is no other
          than Moore's old college friend, Robert Emmet. It was undoubtedly this young man's tragic
          fate which inspired the finest of the songs of freedom contained in the <emph>Irish
          Melodies</emph>.</p>

        <p>Robert's elder brother suffered a term of imprisonment after the revolution of 1798, and
          was then banished; Robert himself escaped imprisonment, and continued to employ his
          liberty in the service of the cause which had cost his brother so much, and was to cost
          his own life. In 1802 he went to Paris, and had an interview with the First Consul, who
          appeared to him »to care as little for Ireland as he did for the republic or for liberty,«
          and several with Talleyrand, whom he considered no more satisfactory, for the purpose of
          making arrangements for the proclamation of an independent Irish Republic, supported by an
          alliance with the French Republic. The moment was an opportune one, for the friendly
          relations which had been re-established <pb n="168"/> for a short time between France and England by the
          Peace of Amiens were on the point of giving way to renewed hostility. Bonaparte seems
          actually to have for a moment contemplated a landing in Ireland (he lamented at St. Helena
          that he had not gone to Ireland instead of to Egypt), and Robert Emmet returned in
          November 1802 to his native island with a distinct promise from the French authorities
          that the landing of their army should take place in August 1803. With untiring audacity he
          prepared for a new rebellion throughout the length and breadth of Ireland. He was
          persuaded that that of 1798 had failed because it had not had sufficient support in the
          capital. His great aim, therefore, was to get possession of Dublin, and more particularly
          of the Castle, the gates of which stood open till late in the evening. Day and night he
          superintended the preparations of the conspirators. In different parts of the town they
          rented a number of houses, where they established secret manufactories of weapons and
          ammunition. Emmet had a staff of fifteen men, almost all of the lower class, to assist him
          in the task of superintendence. Such rest as he granted himself was taken lying on a
          mattress on the floor of one of the powder-magazines.</p>

        <p>Although more than a thousand persons were concerned in the conspiracy, there was not one
          traitor among them, and the merciless Government had not the slightest idea of what was
          impending. Emmet's private fortune was entirely expended on the necessary preparations,
          although the men who served him received no payment for their work. One of them,
          conversing many years afterwards with the author of <emph>The United Irishmen</emph>, told him that
          they worked, not for money, but for the cause; that they had perfect confidence in Robert
          Emmet, and would have given their lives for him. But in the month of July an accident
          occurred; one of the powder-magazines blew up, killing two men, one of whom died in
          Emmet's arms. The following day a Protestant newspaper informed the Government that it was
          sleeping on a mine.</p>

        <p>There could now be no question of waiting for the French; half-prepared as the
          conspirators were, they had <pb n="169"/> either to make their attempt at once or accept the certainty
          of annihilation without a struggle. On the morning of the 23rd of July a manly
          proclamation to the people of Ireland, drawn up by Emmet himself, was discovered posted up
          in the streets of Dublin. But when evening came, and Emmet attempted the surprise of the
          Castle, he proved to his sorrow how unreliable his countrymen were at a dangerous and
          decisive crisis. The number of his followers steadily diminished as they approached the
          Castle, and by the time its gates were reached it was clear that any attack which the mere
          handful of faithful enthusiasts left, could make on the now alert and well-armed enemy was
          doomed to defeat. In the first confusion the rebel leaders succeeded in escaping to the
          hills of Wicklow, where they were able to hold a council the following day. Most of them
          were certain that their cause was anything but a lost one; let them but give the signal,
          and the whole of Ireland would rise like one man, &amp;c, &amp;c. Robert Emmet alone had
          lost all his illusions. He succeeded in convincing his friends that to continue their
          endeavours at this juncture, and without other forces than the undisciplined rebels who
          alone were at their service, would lead to nothing but more shedding of the blood of a
          people who had already suffered so much. At the moment of parting, all the others
          entreated Emmet to take advantage of an opportunity which presented itself of escaping
          from the country at once in a fishing-boat belonging to one of the rebels. But, with a
          slight confusion of manner, he told them that he could not possibly leave Ireland for an
          unlimited number of years without first returning to Dublin to take leave of a lady, who
          was so dear to him that he must see her again if he »had to die for it a thousand
          times.«</p>

        <p>In Dublin the military were on his heels. His faithful housekeeper, a young, brave girl,
          was covered with bayonet pricks and underwent »half-hanging«; but nothing would induce her
          to betray her master's hiding-place. At last he was found and arrested, a pistol-shot in
          the shoulder preventing any attempt at escape. When the officer who arrested him was
          making an excuse for this shot, the prisoner said shortly: »All is fair in war.«</p>

        <p><pb n="170"/> A few days after his imprisonment, Robert Emmet wrote to the young lady for whose sake he
          had risked his life. This was Miss Sarah Curran, a daughter of the eminent and highly
          respected barrister, John Philpot Curran, who is so often named in Byron's poetry, and who
          had been the eloquent, undaunted defender of the political prisoners tried after the
          rebellion of 1798. Young Emmet had been a welcome visitor at Curran's house; but when
          Curran discovered the attachment between the two young people, he separated them, as he
          feared that Emmet's political opinions augured ill for his future; and the correspondence
          between them had been carried on without his knowledge. The jailer demanded a large sum
          from Emmet for conveying his letter to its address, and then took it straight to the
          Attorney-General. Fearing possible injurious consequences to the lady whom he loved, Emmet
          at once wrote to his judges, and, knowing that his eloquence was dreaded, offered to plead
          guilty and not say one word in his own defence if, in return, they would make no
          reference, in the hearing of the case, to his letter to Miss Curran. The offer was made in
          vain. The very next day, the arrival of the police to search his house informed the
          furious Curran of the relations between his daughter and Emmet.</p>

        <p>Of the result of the trial no one had any doubt; the accused knew his fate. When the
          governor of the prison came upon him one day plaiting a lock of hair which Miss Curran had
          given him, he looked up and said: »I am preparing it to take with me to the scaffold.« On
          his table was found a carefully executed pen and ink drawing–an excellent portrait of
          himself, the head severed from the body.</p>

        <p>The trial began at 10 A.M. After the Attorney-General had made a speech, in which he
          affirmed that the only results of the conspiracy had been to elicit stronger proofs than
          had before existed of the attachment of Ireland to its King, Robert Emmet requested that,
          as his only answer, the following paragraph from the proclamation of the provisional
          government, as drawn up by him, might be read aloud: »From this time onward flogging and
          torture are <pb n="171"/> forbidden in Ireland, and may not be reintroduced on any pretext whatever.«
          Hereupon followed a speech by a hateful Irish renegade, Mr. Plunket, who had formerly
          belonged to the party of rebellion, but who now, as King's Counsel, overwhelmed Emmet with
          abuse. Then Emmet himself stood up, and, with the prospect of certain and almost immediate
          death before his eyes, defended himself in a speech with which every Irishman to this day
          is familiar. He began by saying that if he were to suffer only death after being adjudged
          guilty, he should bow in silence to his fate; but the sentence which delivered his body to
          the executioner also consigned his character to obloquy, and therefore he must speak. The
          judge roughly interrupting him in the middle of his speech, he calmly said: »I have
          understood, my Lord, that judges sometimes think it their duty to hear with patience, and
          to speak with humanity,« and continued his speech in such a loud voice as to be distinctly
          heard at the outer doors of the court-house; and yet, though he spoke in a loud tone,
          there was nothing boisterous in his manner. Those who heard him declare, says Madden, that
          his accents and cadence of voice were exquisitely modulated. He moved about the dock as he
          warmed in his address, with characteristic, rapid, and not ungraceful motions. Even after
          the lapse of thirty years, the witnesses of the scene could not speak without emotion of
          the graceful majesty with which he defied his judges. A correspondent of the <emph>Times</emph>, who
          unconditionally condemned the rebellion, wrote of Emmet as follows: »But as to Robert
          Emmet individually, it will surely be admitted that even in the midst of error he was
          great; and that the burst of eloquence with which, upon the day of his trial, with the
          grave already open to receive him, he shook the very court wherein he stood, and caused
          not only 'that viper whom his father nourished' (Mr. Plunket) to quail beneath the lash,
          but likewise forced that 'remnant of humanity' (Lord Norbury, who tried him), to tremble
          on the judgment seat, was an effort almost superhuman.«</p>

        <p>Emmet ended with these words: »My lord, you are impatient for the sacrifice. The blood
          which you seek is <pb n="172"/> not congealed by the artificial terrors which surround your victim–it
          circulates warmly and unruffled through its channels, and in a little time it will cry to
          heaven. Be patient! I have but a few words to say–I am going to my cold and silent
          grave–my lamp of life is nearly extinguished–I have parted with everything that was dear
          to me in this life, and for my country's cause with the idol of my soul, the object of my
          affections. My race is run–the grave opens to receive me, and I sink into its bosom. I
          have but one request to ask at my departure from this world–it is <emph>the charity of its
          silence</emph>. Let no man write my epitaph; for as no man who knows my motives dare now
          vindicate them, let not prejudice or ignorance asperse them. Let them rest in obscurity
          and peace, my memory be left in oblivion, and my tomb remain uninscribed, until other
          times and other men can do justice to my character. When my country takes her place among
          the nations of the earth, then, and not till then, let my epitaph be written. I have
          done.«</p>

        <p>The sentence was pronounced. Robert Emmet was, on the following day, first to be hanged,
          and then beheaded. When the prisoner was removed from the dock it was about ten o'clock at
          night. As he passed the grating of a cell in which a friend was confined, he called to
          him: »I shall be hanged to-morrow.« He was allowed no peace during his last hours. The
          Government became alarmed lest an attempt might be made to rescue him, and an order was
          sent to convey him to Kilmainham jail, two miles and a half away. Not till he reached
          there did a humane jailer take off the irons which had been put on so roughly that they
          had drawn blood. The same man gave him something to eat, no food having been provided for
          him since before the trial began, at ten in the morning. Emmet then slept soundly for a
          short time. On awaking he employed the time left him in writing letters to his brother in
          America, to Miss Curran's brother, and to herself. He was interrupted by a friend, who
          came to bid him farewell. Emmet's first inquiry was after his mother, and his friend was
          obliged to tell him that she had died the day before of grief. She had borne with
          fortitude the banishment of one of her sons for <pb n="173"/> his devotion to the cause of Ireland, and
          she had encouraged Robert in all his proceedings; but when she knew that he, the pride of
          her heart, was doomed, in his twenty-third year, to such a terrible death, her heart
          broke. Robert received the news composedly, and said, after a silence of some moments: »It
          is better so.« In his letter to young Curran he wrote: »I did not look to honours for
          myself–praise I would have asked from the lips of no man; but I would have wished to read
          in the glow of Sarah's countenance that her husband was respected.« His writing in this
          letter is as firm and regular as usual.</p>

        <p>At one o'clock, escorted by the sheriffs and followed by the executioner, he was led to
          the scaffold. So great was the power of his gentleness and charm over wild, rude natures,
          that one of the warders burst into tears at parting from him. Emmet, whose arms were
          bound, bent forward and kissed the man on the cheek; and the jailer, whom twenty years of
          service had hardened, and inured to prison scenes, fell senseless at his prisoner's feet.
          Before mounting the scaffold Emmet entrusted to one of his friends the letter which he had
          written to Miss Curran; but the friend was arrested and imprisoned, and this letter, like
          the other, did not reach its destination. Emmet took off his neckerchief himself, and
          assisted in adjusting the rope round his neck. After his head was struck from the body the
          executioner held it up to the crowd, proclaiming in a loud voice: »This is the head of a
          traitor, Robert Emmet!« Not a sound was heard in answer.</p>

        <p>Next day the readers of the <emph>London Chronicle</emph>, the Government organ, were told: »He
          behaved without the least symptom of fear, and with all the effrontery and nonchalance
          which so much distinguished his conduct on his trial yesterday. He seems to scoff at the
          dreadful circumstances attending on him, at the same time, with all the coolness and
          complacency that can be possibly imagined, though utterly unlike the calmness of Christian
          fortitude. Even as it was, I never saw a man die like him; and God forbid I should see
          many with his principles.... The clergyman who attended him endeavoured to win him from <pb n="174"/> his deistical opinions. He thanked him for his exertions, but said that his opinions on
          such subjects had long been settled, and that this was not the time to change them.« Thus
          spoke the official press. Oppressed Ireland kept silence at the scaffold of her young
          hero, and, faithful to his wish, carved no epitaph on his tomb.</p>

        <p>But when Moore's <emph>Irish Melodies</emph> appeared, it was as if the grief and wrath of a whole
          nation had suddenly found expression; in these songs it rose and fell, whispered and
          shouted, moaned and murmured, like the waves of the sea, and with the irresistible force
          of a natural element. Soon there was not a peasant in Ireland, as there is not one today,
          unfamiliar with the song: »When he who adores thee.« To this day Robert Emmet's last
          speech is read in American schools. It is the gospel of the Irish struggle for
          independence. But, strangely enough, Emmet's heroic death contributed less to his fame
          among his countrymen than did his touching love story. His betrothed, regarded by the
          Irish people as their hero's widow, became the object of silent veneration. Her
          unhappiness was increased by her being obliged to live amongst people who sided with
          England, and who considered, much as they pitied him, that Emmet had deserved his fate.
          Some years after Emmet's death Miss Curran made the acquaintance of an English officer, a
          Captain Sturgeon, who, touched by her forlorn position and attracted by her many charms,
          offered her his hand. After long hesitation she married him. As she was beginning to show
          symptoms of decline, he took her to Italy. Her appearance, says Admiral Napier, who saw
          her at Naples, was that of »a wandering statue.« She died, not long after her marriage, in
          Sicily, »far from the land where her young hero sleeps.« Washington Irving has described
          her in his <emph>Sketch Book</emph>, in the beautiful tale called »The Broken Heart.« But her most
          worthy monument is the song: »She is far from the land.«<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Madden: <emph>United Irishmen. Robert Emmet</emph>: anonymous, but known to be written by Madame d'Haussonville.</note></p>

        <p>In the <emph>Melodies</emph>, however, the griefs of the individual are but a symbol of those of the
          nation, an embodiment of the <pb n="175"/> universal suffering. We come upon songs in which we seem to
          hear all the sons and daughters of Ireland lamenting over the fruitlessness of the great
          French Revolution and the disappointment of the hopes which all nations, but theirs above
          all others, had set upon the stability and victory of the Republic. Such a song is the
          touching:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»'Tis gone, and for ever, the light we saw breaking«;</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>

        <p>with its wild lament that the first ray of liberty, welcomed with blessings by man, has
          disappeared, and by its disappearance deepened the darkness of the night of bondage and
          mourning which has again closed in over the kingdoms of the earth, and darkest of all over
          Erin. Truly noble and lofty is the flight of this verse:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»For high was thy hope, when those glories were darting</l>
          <l>Around thee, through all the gross clouds of the world;</l>
          <l>When Truth, from her fetters indignantly starting,</l>
          <l>At once, like a sunburst, her banner unfurled.</l>
          <l>Oh, never shall earth see a moment so splendid!</l>
          <l>Then, then, had one Hymn of Deliverance blended</l>
          <l>The tongues of all nations; how sweet had ascended</l>
          <l>The first note of Liberty, Erin, from thee!«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>

        <p>And the poem ends with maledictions on the »light race, unworthy its good,« who »like
          furies caressing the young hope of freedom, baptized it in blood.« Other poems are of a
          more threatening nature, although the threat is always poetic and half-concealed. Read,
          for example, the song, »Lay his sword by his side.«</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Lay his sword by his side,–it hath served him too well</l>
          <l>Not to rest near his pillow below;</l>
          <l>To the last moment true, from his hand ere it fell,</l>
          <l>Its point was still turn'd to a flying foe.</l>
          <l>…</l>
          <l>Yet pause–for, in fancy, a still voice I hear,</l>
          <l>…</l>
          <l>And it cries, from the grave where the hero lies deep,</l>
          <l>'Tho' the day of your Chieftain for ever hath set,</l>
          <l>'Oh, leave not his sword thus inglorious to sleep,–</l> 
          <l>'It hath victory's life in it yet!'«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>

        <p><pb n="176"/> The poem which is directly aimed at the Prince Regent is the most severe and most
          high-toned of them all. It is the one which begins: »When first I met thee, warm and
          young.« The Prince's name is not mentioned, but the verses can only be understood when it
          is known that it is to him they refer. Erin, speaking as a woman, describes her belief in
          him, her faith in the promises he made when »young and warm« and her continued reliance on
          him even when she saw him change. When she heard of his follies, she persisted in
          discovering, even in his faults, »some gleams of future glory.« But now that the
          attractive qualities of youth have departed, and none of the virtues of maturity have
          replaced them, now that those who once loved him avoid him, and even his flatterers
          despise him, Erin would not give one of her »taintless tears« for all his guilty
          splendour. And the day will come when his last friends will forsake him, and he will call
          in vain on her whom he has lost for ever. She will say:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg><l>»Go–go–'tis vain to curse,</l>
          <l>'Tis weakness to upbraid thee;</l>
          <l>Hate cannot wish thee worse</l>
          <l>Than guilt and shame have made thee.«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>

        <p>Wordsworth addressed declarations of love to England when she was victorious and great;
          Scott sang the praises of Scotland at a time when she was beginning to take her place as a
          flourishing nation by the side of a sister kingdom; but Moore addressed his heartfelt,
          glowing strains to a country which lay humiliated and bleeding at its torturers' feet. He
          writes:–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Remember thee! yes, while there's life in this heart,</l>
          <l>It shall never forget thee, all lorn as thou art;</l>
          <l>More dear in thy sorrow, thy gloom, and thy showers,</l>
          <l>Than the rest of the world in their sunniest hours.</l></lg>

        <lg>
          <l>Wert thou all that I wish thee,–great, glorious, and free–</l>
          <l>First flower of the earth,and first gem of the sea,–</l>
          <l>I might hail thee with prouder, with happier brow,</l>
          <l>But, oh! could I love thee more deeply than now?«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>

        <p><pb n="177"/> And in everything that Moore wrote, there is a remembrance of Ireland. His great Oriental
          poem, <emph>Lalla Rookh</emph>, which appeared in 1817, was prepared for by the most conscientious
          study. There is not an image, not a description, or name, or historical incident or
          reference, which has any connection with Europe. Everything, without exception, bears
          witness to the familiarity of the author with the life and nature of the East.
          Nevertheless we know that the subject did not begin to interest him until he saw a
          possibility of making the struggle between the Fire-worshippers and the Mohammedans a
          pretext for preaching tolerance in the spirit of the song, »Come, send round the wine,«
          which he had addressed to his countrymen in the <emph>Irish Melodies</emph>. And the interest of the
          reader, too, is not really awakened until he begins to divine Ireland and the Irish under
          these Ghebers and their strange surroundings. Hence it is that <emph>The Fire-Worshippers</emph> is
          the only entirely successful part of the poem. The very names Iran and Erin melt into each
          other in the reader's ear. Moore himself says that the spirit which spoke in the <emph>Irish
          Melodies</emph> did not begin to feel at home in the East till he set it to work on the
          <emph>Fire-Worshippers</emph>; and the beautiful poem, whose hero is a noble and unfortunate rebel,
          and whose heroine lives amongst people who speak of her lover with detestation, might well
          have been inspired by the memory of Robert Emmet and Sarah Curran. Some of the incidents
          recall their story. Before Hafed calls the Ghebers to revolt he has been wandering, an
          exile, in foreign lands; Hinda, devoured by anxiety for him, hears every day of massacres
          of the rebels. And when, learning that her lover has been burned, she drowns herself, the
          poet bewails her fate in a song, entire verses of which might, if <emph>Erin</emph> were substituted
          for <emph>Iran</emph>, be added to »She is far from the land« without introducing a perceptibly
          foreign element. Take, for instance, the verse:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Nor shall Iran, beloved of her Hero, forget thee–</l>
          <l>Though tyrants watch over her tears as they start,</l>
          <l>Close, close by the side of that Hero she'll set thee,</l>
          <l>Embalmed in the innermost shrine of her heart.«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>

        <p><pb n="178"/> And so exact is the resemblance between the spirit of the <emph>Irish Melodies</emph> and that which
          reigns in this Asiatic epic, that it was possible to employ a sentence from the latter,
          without the change of a single word, as motto for the collection of documents relating to
          the Irish Rebellion which was published in the Fifties under the title: <emph>Rebellion Book
          and Black History</emph>. The lines are as follows;–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Rebellion! foul, dishonouring word,</l>
          <l>Whose wrongful blight so oft has stained</l>
          <l>The holiest cause that tongue or sword</l>
          <l>Of mortal ever lost or gained.</l>
          <l>How many a spirit born to bless</l>
          <l>Hath sunk beneath that withering name,</l>

        <p>It was Moore's polemical position as an Irishman that made it impossible for him to see
          European politics in the same light as they appeared to the Lake School and Scott. He
          directed a shower of the arrows of his wit against the Holy Alliance. In the <emph>Fables for
          the Holy Alliance</emph>, which he dedicated to Lord Byron, he jests, good-humouredly but
          audaciously, at the European reaction. He dreams, for example, that Czar Alexander gives a
          splendid ball in an ice-palace which he has erected on the frozen Neva, on the plan of
          that built by the Empress Anne. To it are invited all the »holy gentlemen« who, at the
          various Congresses, have shown such regard for the welfare of Europe.</p>

        <p>Madame de Krüdener has pledged her prophetic word that there is no danger, that the ice
          will never melt. But, lo! ere long an ill-omened dripping begins. The Czar goes on with
          his polonaise, but so glassy has the floor become that he can hardly keep his legs; and
          Prussia, »though to slippery ways so used, was cursedly near tumbling.« But <pb n="179"/> hardly has the
          Spanish fandango begun when a glaring light–»as 'twere a glance shot from an angry
          southern sun«–begins to shine in every chamber of the palace. Then there is a general
          »Sauve qui peut!« Instantly everything is in a flow–royal arms, Russian and Prussian
          birds of prey and French fleur-de-lys, floors, walls, and ceilings, kings, fiddlers,
          emperors, all are gone. Why, asks Moore,</p>

        <p>It is evident that he hoped great things from the Spanish Revolution, which had just
          begun.</p>

        <p>In another fable he tells of a country where there was a ridiculous law prohibiting the
          importation of looking-glasses. What was the reason of this prohibition? The reason was
          that the royal race reigned by right of their superior beauty, and the people obeyed
          because <emph>they</emph> were declared, and believed themselves to be, ugly. To hint that the King's
          nose was not straight, was high treason; to suggest that one's own neighbour was as
          good-looking as certain persons in high position, was almost as great a crime; and the
          subjects, never having seen looking-glasses, did not <emph>know themselves</emph>. Certain wicked
          Radicals arranged that a ship with a cargo of looking-glasses should be driven ashore on
          this country's coast–and the reader guesses the rest. In a third fable the poet returns
          to his old symbolic characters, the Fire-worshippers. Less tolerant here than in <emph>Lalla
          Rookh</emph>, he makes the Fire-worshippers throw the whole corps of »extinguishers,« who have
          been appointed to obstruct them in the peaceful exercise of their religious rites, into
          the flames which they will not allow to burn.</p>

        <p>The work which shows Moore's humour and satire at its best, <emph>The Fudge Family in Paris</emph>,
          is full of witty sallies against the new, incapable Bourbon Government, but strikes at
          England in bold, dead earnest. We find such lines as:</p>

        <p>This sounds very bad and very dangerous; the distance separating such a writer from the
          older generation of poets strikes us as great; it seems but a step from this to Shelley
          and Byron. But as a matter of fact, it is a long way; for all these attacks are not quite
          so seriously meant as one would imagine. This champion of the cause of Ireland was no
          advocate of her independence; Moore did not desire the separation of his country from
          England; he only desired that she should be ruled better and more justly. This bold
          denouncer of kings was no republican, but a sincere believer in monarchy, who would have
          had bad kings replaced by good ones. He was no free-thinker, this man who railed so
          violently at the hypocrisy of the Holy Alliance, but a sincere, enlightened Catholic, who,
          though he brought up his children as Protestants, wrote a thick book, <emph>Travels of an Irish
          Gentleman in search of a Religion</emph>, in defence of the most important doctrines of the
          Catholic faith. With all his apparent unrestraint, Moore kept within the bounds prescribed
          by the society in which he lived. The Whig <pb n="181"/> leaders had, when he came to London, received
          him with open arms, and Moore became and remained the Whig poet, who in a long series of
          playfully sarcastic letters–rhymed feuilletons one might call them–treated the public
          questions and Parliamentary events of the day with sparkling wit and drawing-room humour
          of the best style, in the spirit of the Whig party.</p>

        <p>Moore was by nature disposed to gaiety and happiness, not to solitary conflict. He was
          created to occupy, in the manner of the ancient Irish bards, an honourable place at the
          table of the great, and while away their time with song. A sign of his being one of
          fortune's favourites is that he often jests even when he is most in earnest, unlike Byron,
          who, even when he jests, is serious, nay, gloomy. Moore plays with his theme and caresses
          it; Byron tears his to pieces, and turns from it in disgust. The two friends are
          constantly observing and reproducing nature; but under Byron's gaze the sun itself seems
          to be darkened, whilst Moore, with his love of rosy red and brightness and sparkle,
          himself creates »a morning sun which rises at noon.«</p>

        <p>Hence we get but a one-sided picture of Moore when we study him, as our plan has led us
          to do, chiefly as a political poet. He is also the writer of some of the best and most
          musical erotic lyrics in existence. The music of his verse is more exuberant than
          delicate; but there is magic in his handling of language. In his love poems a fascinating,
          glowing sensuousness and an ardent tenderness have found expression in word-melodies which
          are as tuneful as airs by Rossini. English admirers of Shelley, accustomed to more
          delicate, and, to the uninitiated, more perplexing harmonies, may, if they please, call
          these songs »over-sweet«; erotic verse cannot be too erotic; as the French say: »In love
          too much is not enough,« Moore is no Mozart; but is this not almost like a Mozart air,
          like one of the hero's or Zerlina's in <emph>Don Juan</emph>?</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»The young May-moon is beaming, love!</l>
          <l>The glow-worm's lamp is gleaming, love!</l>

          <l>Through Morna's grove,</l>
          <l>While the drowsy world is dreaming, love!«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p><pb n="183"/> Songs by Rossini and Moore retain their value even though the world owned at the same
          time a Schubert and a Shelley. Nowhere are the distinguishing characteristics of the
          different English poets of this period more clearly reflected than in their love poems;
          whilst at the same time the Naturalism distinguishing the period stands out in sharp
          contrast to the supernaturalism of the erotic poetry of the German and French reaction
          periods. Byron's description of his most beautiful female character as »Nature's bride and
          Passion's child« (<emph>Don Juan</emph> ii. 202), and his description of the love of Don Juan and
          Haidée:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»This is in others a factitious state,</l>
          <l>An opium dream of too much youth and reading,</l>
          <l>But was in them their nature or their fate,«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>might serve as characterisations of the love celebrated in the amatory poetry of the
          majority of his contemporaries. But only in <emph>Don Juan</emph> has Byron painted happy love. His
          erotic poems are nothing but misery and lamentation. The most marvellous of them all,
          »When we two parted,« has a sob in its very rhythm; and the whole pain of parting is
          conveyed by the manner in which the rhythm suddenly changes in the last verse. In the
          first lines there is still a certain calmness of passion:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»When we two parted</l>
          <l>In silence and tears,</l>
          <l>Half broken-hearted,</l>
          <l>To sever for years,</l>
          <l>Pale grew thy cheek and cold,</l>
          <l>Colder thy kiss;</l>
          <l>Truly that hour foretold</l>
          <l>Sorrow to this.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>But all the misery of love is expressed in the short, abrupt cadences of the concluding
          stanza:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»In secret we met–</l>
          <l>In silence I grieve,</l>
          <l>That thy heart could forget,</l>
          <l>Thy spirit deceive.</l>
          <l>If I should meet thee</l>
          <l>After long years,</l>
          <l>How should I greet thee?–</l>
          <l>With silence and tears.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p><pb n="184"/> The peculiar domain of Byronic love-poetry is that of the tortures of love.</p>

        <p>Thomas Campbell has not written many purely erotic poems–he prefers the shorter or
          longer love-story in verse to the personal outburst–but some of the few are as tender in
          tone as Moore's or Keats's. And, strange to say, he becomes warmer, tenderer, less
          restrained in expression as time passes. It is as an old man that he writes his most
          amatory verse. To the remonstrance of conscience, that Platonic friendship should content
          him at his years, he answers by a challenge to Plato himself in the skies to look into the
          eyes of a certain lady »and try to be Platonic.«</p>

        <p>He sings of the transient nature of love, of the suffering occasioned by the absence of
          the beloved; he puts into words the sufferings of the maid whose lover is »never wedding,
          ever wooing.« But he is most characteristically himself as the erotic poet when he
          confesses, with a half mournful smile, that his heart is younger than his years, as in the
          following verses:–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»The god left my heart, at its surly reflections,</l>
          <l>But came back on pretext of some sweet recollections,</l>
          <l>And he made me forget what I ought to remember,</l>
          <l>That the rose-bud of June cannot bloom in November.</l>
          <l>Ah! Tom, 'tis all o'er with thy gay days–</l>
          <l>Write psalms, and not songs for the ladies.</l></lg>

        <lg>
          <l>But time's been so far from my wisdom enriching,</l>
          <l>That the longer I live, beauty seems more bewitching;</l>
          <l>And the only new lore my experience traces,</l>
          <l>Is to find fresh enchantment in magical faces.</l>
          <l>How weary is wisdom, how weary!</l>
          <l>When one sits by a smiling young dearie!«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>Keats's erotic verse is, as was to be expected, burning, breathless, sensual; it revels
          in fragrance and sweet sounds. Read this masterly verse:–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Lift the latch! ah gently! ah tenderly–sweet!</l>
          <l>We are dead if that latchet gives one little clink!</l>
          <l>Well done–now those lips, and a flowery seat–</l>
          <l>The old man may sleep, and the planets may wink;</l>
          <l>The shut rose shall dream of our loves, and awake</l>
          <l>Full blown, and such warmth for the morning's take;</l>
          <l>The stock-dove shall hatch her soft brace and shall coo,</l>
          <l>While I kiss to the melody, aching all through.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p><pb n="185"/> Shelley's love-poetry is at one and the same time hyper-spiritual and meltingly sensuous.
          We are reminded by it of Correggio. In the productions of both these artists the
          expression of the most utter self-surrender is blent with the expression of the most
          violent sensual excitement; what Shelley describes is the erotic death-struggle. Take the
          concluding verse of the <emph>The Indian Serenade</emph>:–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Oh lift me from the grass!</l>
          <l>I die, I faint, I fail!</l>
          <l>Let thy love in kisses rain</l>
          <l>On my lips and eyelids pale.</l>
          <l>My cheek is cold and white, alas!</l>
          <l>My heart beats loud and fast;</l>
         <l> Oh! press it to thine own again</l>
          <l>Where it will break at last.«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>

        <p>And along with it the transport with which <emph>Epipsychidion</emph> concludes:–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Our breath shall intermix, our bosoms bound,</l>
          <l>And our veins beat together; and our lips</l>
          <l>With other eloquence than words, eclipse</l>
          <l>The soul that burns between them, and the wells</l>
          <l>Which boil under our being's inmost cells,</l>
          <l>The fountains of our deepest life, shall be</l>
          <l>Confused in passion's golden purity,</l> 
          <l>As mountain-springs under the morning Sun.</l>
          <l>…</l>
          <l>One hope within two wills, one will beneath</l>
          <l>Two overshadowing minds, one life, one death,</l>
          <l>One Heaven, one Hell, one immortality,</l>
          <l>And one annihilation. Woe is me!</l>
          <l>The winged words on which my soul would pierce</l>
          <l>Into the height of love's rare  universe,</l>
          <l>Are chains of lead around its flight of fire–</l>
          <l>I pant, I sink, I tremble, I expire!«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>

        <p>If Byron's domain is that of the tortures of the luckless or forsaken lover, Shelley's
          is, as we see, that of the pain of the happy lover, of self-annihilation in the rapture of
          love. But for the very reason that the erotic domain of both these great poets was thus
          definitely limited, neither of them wrote many erotic poems; to neither was this one of
          the most important fields of his productivity.</p>

        <p><pb n="186"/> Moore, on the contrary, was a born erotic poet, of the type of our (Danish) Christian
          Winther. What the majority of love-poets are possessed by is the erotic passion; Moore's
          distinguishing characteristic is erotic fancy. He loves everything that is beautiful,
          exquisite, delicate, soft, and bright, for its own sake, without requiring any background
          to throw it into relief. He never tells any eventful story, never sets off by any strong
          contrast, never undermines by deep brooding. He loves the blossoms of the tree, not its
          roots. The objects which fascinate him, fascinate with the first impression; they are
          beautiful and bright; they dazzle the senses; they enthral the eye and the ear more than
          the heart; they are exchanged for other objects possessing the same qualities–there is a
          constant gleam and flutter. But all essentially erotic poets have butterfly natures. In
          this matter no more striking contrast can be imagined than that between Wordsworth and
          Moore. The former deliberately chooses themes which in themselves are insignificant, or
          unattractive, or even ugly, in order to endow them with a moral or spiritual beauty; the
          latter detests the sordid details of human life, recoils from all its adversities, and
          evades every moral with a Wieland-like smile and bow. When he is forced to give the ugly a
          place, he cannot resist casting a soft, glittering veil over it. His style has been blamed
          for its overweight of gorgeous adjectives, its propensity to let every passion lose itself
          in a simile, and its restless glitter and gleam. It has been called artificial in
          comparison with Wordsworth's. »Artificial!« cries one of his Irish admirers, »when every
          human being can enjoy Moore's poetry, whilst a new taste has to be created to enable one
          to enjoy Wordsworth's!« Is it really the case, then, we are led to ask, that study and a
          cultivated taste are required for the enjoyment of the natural, whilst only ordinary
          feeling is demanded for the enjoyment of artificial beauty? Wordsworth and Coleridge were
          poets for a cultivated, literary public; Moore was the poet for a nation. The faults with
          which he may fairly be charged are the consequences of his natural limitations, of his
          being a musician and a colourist, but not a draughtsman; he is incapable of drawing or
          describing a <emph>whole</emph> object, what he <pb n="187"/> does is to paint the separate attributes of beautiful
          objects. He devotes verse after verse to the praises of a blush, a smile, the melody of a
          voice; instead of beautiful outlines he gives us a list of beauties. Employing Voltaire's
          clever definition of love–»nature's cloth, which imagination has embroidered«–it must be
          confessed that in Moore's love-poetry the embroidery is often so gorgeous and abundant
          that it hardly permits the cloth to appear at all. But the cloth is there, and is
          nature's.</p>

        <p>And it is only fair to add that in Moore's best and most beautiful poems the
          over-abundance of imagery has disappeared. Where the true Irish melancholy has taken
          possession of his soul, it has blown away all the tinsel and found expression in
          imperishable language. The style of »Take back the virgin page« and »The last rose of
          summer« is as simple as their metre is perfect. There is not a simile in either of them.
          Nor is there a single simile in the beautiful little song which, in spite of its brevity,
          has for Ireland all the significance of a national epic–the simple song of the lovely
          young girl who, though adorned with precious jewels and with a beauty still more alluring,
          went without fear from one end of Ireland to the other, knowing that Erin's sons, »though
          they love woman and golden store,« love honour and virtue more. (»Rich and rare were the
          gems she wore.«) Of the man who wrote such a song Byron might safely assert: »Moore's
          <emph>Irish Melodies</emph> will go down to posterity with their music; and both will last as long as
          Ireland or as music and poetry.«</p>

        <p>Moore's was a happy life. At the age of thirty-one he married a beautiful and amiable
          girl, Miss Bessy Dyke; and their married life was a most harmonious one. He was not always
          in good circumstances, but after his fame was established, his works provided him with a
          handsome income. Though in the <emph>Grand Dinner of Type and Co</emph>. he makes the rich publishers
          (in the manner of the legendary warriors who after death drank mead out of the skulls of
          their enemies) drink their wine out of the skulls of poor authors, he himself had no
          reason to complain of his publisher, who offered him £3000 for <emph>Lalla Rookh</emph> before seeing
          a line of it, <pb n="188"/> and gave him £4200 for his excellent Life of Lord Byron. Moore was held in
          equal honour by the Irish and English. In 1818 he was entertained at a banquet in Dublin
          by all the most famous literary and public men of the country, and when he went to Paris
          in 1822 he was <emph>fêted</emph> by the British nobility there. It was not till he grew old that
          misfortunes came upon him. Then he lost his health and had severe trials with his
          children. He died in 1842.</p>

        <head><pb n="[189]"/> XIV. THE BRITISH SPIRIT OF FREEDOM</head>

        <p>The poet Thomas Campbell, descended from an ancient Highland family, and born and brought
          up in Scotland, was, like Scott, an ardent Scottish patriot; he also felt warm sympathy
          for Ireland, and, like Moore, sang her national memories and sorrows; but he combined love
          of the two subordinate countries with an ardent and martial British patriotism.</p>

        <p>He was, however, not only a national poet in the sense in which Wordsworth was one, but
          also, from his youth to his death, an enthusiastic lover of liberty. His epic poems and
          his ballads are not superior to corresponding productions of Wordsworth's; but he had true
          lyric genius. He is the Tyrtæus or Petöfi of the Naturalistic School. To him the cause of
          his country and the cause of liberty are one and the same thing, and in his best verse
          there is a spirit, a swinging march time, and a fire, that entitle him, if only for the
          sake of half-a-dozen short pieces, to a place among great poets.</p>

        <p>His poem <emph>The Battle of the Baltic</emph> is, naturally, little calculated to make a favourable
          impression on Danes. His pride in the victory Nelson won over a force so much weaker than
          his own, but which the poem magnifies into the same size as England's, is the very
          extravagance of patriotism. But, side by side with this poem, and written at the same
          time, we have <emph>Ye Mariners of England</emph>, a masterpiece, in the rhythm of which we seem to
          hear the gale rattling among English sails. Here the true son of the Queen of the Sea,
          singing of the British sailor, celebrates his mother's praises.</p>

        <p><pb n="190"/> Notice the rushing, sweeping force and exultation compressed into the last four lines of
          this stanza:–</p>

          <l>And the stormy winds do blow.</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>Campbell's life was a well regulated and tranquil one. Born in Glasgow in 1777, he
          received an excellent education there and in Edinburgh. At the age of twenty-one he
          published his <emph>Pleasures of Hope</emph>, which, though now antiquated, created a sensation on
          its appearance, and with the proceeds undertook a tour in Germany, during the course of
          which he wrote several poems inspired by the hostilities with Denmark–among them the two
          above mentioned. In 1803 he married his cousin and settled in London. He wrote, lectured,
          and from 1820 onwards edited a newspaper. After 1830 his health was precarious and his
          powers were enfeebled. He lived, a shadow of himself, until 1844.</p>

        <p>It is the same with Campbell as with all the other authors of the group to which he
          belonged–his poetic faculty is based upon the freshness of his receptivity to natural
          impressions. He has written a poem to the rainbow which, <pb n="191"/> in spite of a rather prosaic and
          argumentative introduction, is a little masterpiece of simplicity and fancy. He begins by
          imagining the feelings of »the world's grey fathers« when they came forth to watch its
          first appearance:–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>

          <l>To bless the bow of God.</l></lg>

        <lg>
          <l>Methinks, thy jubilee to keep,</l>
          <l>The first made anthem rang</l>
          <l>On earth delivered from the deep,</l>
          <l>And the first poet sang.</l></lg>

        <lg>
          <l>Nor ever shall the Muse's eye</l>
          <l>Unraptured greet thy beam:</l>
          <l>Theme of primeval prophecy,</l>
          <l>Be still the poet's theme!</l>
          <l>…</l>
          <l>How glorious is thy girdle cast</l>
          <l>O'er mountain, tower, and town,</l>
          <l>Or mirrored in the ocean vast,</l>
          <l>A thousand fathoms down!</l></lg>

        <lg>

          <l>As when the eagle from the ark</l>
          <l>First sported in thy beam.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>And one of his latest poems, <emph>The Dead Eagle</emph>, written at Oran in Africa, bears witness
          to the same, unenfeebled, receptivity to all the phenomena of nature as this early one. In
          the later work we are conscious of a joy in natural strength and power which is
          characteristically English. »True« the poet writes:</p>

          <l>As easily as the Arab reins his steed,</l>
          <l><pb n="192"/> And stood at pleasure 'neath heaven's zenith, like</l>
          <l>A lamp suspended from its azure dome,</l>
          <l>Whilst underneath him the world's mountains lay</l>
          <l>Like molehills, and her streams like lucid threads.</l>
          <l>Then downward, faster than a falling star,</l>
          <l>He near'd the earth, until his shape distinct</l>
          <l>Was blackly shadow'd on the sunny ground;</l>
          <l>And deeper terror hush'd the wilderness,</l>
          <l>To hear his nearer whoop. Then, up again</l>
          <l>He soar'd and wheel'd. There was an air of scorn</l>
          <l>In all his movements, whether he threw round</l>
          <l>His crested head to look behind him, or</l>
          <l>Lay vertical and sportively display'd,</l>
          <l>The inside whiteness of his wing declined</l>
          <l>In gyres and undulations full of grace.</l>
          <l>…</l>
          <l>He–reckless who was victor, and above</l>
          <l>The hearing of their guns–saw fleets engaged </l>
          <l>In flaming combat. It was nought to him</l>
          <l>What carnage, Moor or Christian, strew'd their decks.</l>
          <l>But if his intellect had match'd his wings,</l>
          <l>Methinks he would have scorn'd man's vaunted power</l>
          <l>To plough the deep; his pinions bore him down</l>
          <l>To Algiers the warlike, or the coral groves</l>
          <l>That blush beneath the green of Bona's waves;</l>
          <l>And traversed in an hour a wider space</l>
          <l>Than yonder gallant ship, with all her sails</l>
          <l>Wooing the winds, can cross from morn till eve.</l>
          <l>…</l>
          <l>… The earthquake's self</l> 
          <l>Disturb'd not him that memorable day,</l>
          <l>When o'er yon table-land, where Spain had built</l>
          <l>Cathedrals, cannon'd forts, and palaces,</l>
          <l>A palsy-stroke of Nature shook Oran,</l>
          <l>Turning her city to a sepulchre,</l>
          <l>And strewing into rubbish all her homes.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>There is wealth of imagination in this as well as wealth of observation.</p>

        <p>But Campbell is greatest in his poetry of freedom, in poems like <emph>Men of England, Stanzas
          on the Battle of Navarino, Lines on Poland, the Power of Russia</emph>, and such noble, profound
          expressions of spiritual freedom as that entitled <emph>Hallowed Ground</emph>. In such productions
          as these he plainly shows his spiritual superiority to the poets of the Lake School, who,
          like him, wrote glorious verse in honour <pb n="193"/> of the nations who were struggling for their
          independence. The Lake poets honoured the struggle only when it was against the tyranny of
          Napoleon, England's enemy. Campbell makes no difference of this kind; in the name of
          freedom he often exhorts and even rebukes England, whereas to the other poets she is
          freedom's very hearth and home.</p>

        <p>Note, in <emph>Men of England</emph>, the warmth with which he insists that the records of valour in
          war are as nothing compared with the glowing love of liberty in the breasts of living men,
          and that the glory of the martyrs of freedom is worth a hundred Agincourts.</p>

        <p>Campbell's joy at the liberation of Greece is as genuine as his grief over the fall of
          Poland; but the poem on Poland is more ardent, in its indignation, its hope, its lament
          that »England has not heart to throw the gauntlet down.« And the verses on the power of
          Russia display as clear an understanding of the danger to civilisation which lies in the
          success of Russia, and of the real significance of the defeat of Poland, as if a statesman
          had turned poet.</p>

        <p>The poem <emph>Hallowed Ground</emph> is, in its bold simplicity, a plain protest against all
          superstition, whatever name it bears, and a manly confession of faith in the gospel of
          liberty as proclaimed by the eighteenth century. What is hallowed ground? asks
          Campbell:</p>

          <l><pb n="194"/> That's hallow'd ground–where, mourn'd and miss'd.</l>
          <l>The lips repose our love has kiss'd;–</l>
          <l>But where's their memory's mansion? Is't</l>
          <l>Yon churchyard's bowers?</l>
          <l>No! in ourselves their souls exist,</l>
          <l>A part of ours.</l></lg>

        <lg>
          <l>A kiss can consecrate the ground</l>
          <l>Where mated hearts are mutual bound;</l>
          <l>The spot where love's first links were wound,</l>
          <l>That ne'er were riven,</l>
          <l>Is hallow'd down to earth's profound,</l>
          <l>And up to heaven!«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>And, though the ashes of those who have served mankind may be scattered to the winds,
          they themselves, he says, live on in men's hearts as in consecrated ground; until the
          high-priesthood of Peace, Independence, Truth, shall make earth at last <emph>all hallowed
          ground</emph>.</p>

        <p>Campbell cannot be numbered among the greatest poets of the Naturalistic School; but in
          his lyrics there is a simple, powerful, and melodious pathos which reminds us of the old
          Greek elegiac poets. Although Scotch by birth, his sympathies were with Ireland, and his
          spirit was British. Although, like the poets of the Lake School, ardently patriotic, he
          was distinctly the lover and champion of liberty, and of liberty as a divinity, not as an
          idol. He forms the connecting link between the national poets of Scotland and Ireland and
          the three great English poet-emigrants of this period.</p>

        <head><pb n="[195]"/> XV. REPUBLICAN HUMANISM</head>

        <p>During the period when England, as a European power, was doing the errands of the Holy
          Alliance, and within her own borders was oppressing the Roman Catholics and reducing the
          lower classes to distressful poverty by unduly favouring the landowners, there was a
          steady increase in the number of Englishmen who left their own country to live the life of
          knights-errant of freedom, and, as it were, remind the world of England's ancient fame as
          the protector of national independence. Such Englishmen were General Wilson, who, under
          Bolivar, liberated South America, and Admiral Cochrane, who won fame first in the
          Brazilian and then in the Greek war of liberation. And to this class also belongs <emph>Walter
          Savage Landor</emph>, the proudest and most singular figure in the literary world of his
          period.</p>

        <p>Landor, born at Warwick in 1775, was the descendant of an ancient family and the heir of
          princely wealth. He studied at Oxford. In 1802 he resided for a time in Paris. On his
          return he sold the greater part of his property in Warwickshire and bought one in another
          county, on which he introduced every possible kind of improvement, to ensure that his
          numerous tenants should live under more favourable conditions than their class elsewhere
          in England. He spent £70,000 on these attempts at reform, which he carried out with less
          understanding of human nature than desire for human welfare. His benevolence was
          shamefully abused by its recipients, many of whom took advantage of his unselfishness and
          generosity to defraud him on a large scale. Enraged by the ingratitude and bad behaviour
          of his tenants, he determined to sell all his property, even the land which had been in
          the possession of his family for seven hundred years, <pb n="196"/> and to live thenceforward as a free
          citizen of the world. This resolution he carried out in 1806.</p>

        <p>As soon as he heard of the Spanish rebellion against the tyranny of Napoleon, Landor went
          to Spain, equipped a small troop at his own expense, and fought with the rebels. He
          received a public letter of thanks from the Spanish Junta, along with a commission as
          colonel in the Spanish army. This commission he returned when King Ferdinand was restored,
          with a letter in which he declared that, although he should always be devoted to the cause
          of Spain, he could have nothing to do with »a perjurer and traitor« like its King. In this
          one act we have the man's character–precipitate and reckless, but proud and high-minded.
          In this author's breast beat the heart of an independent chieftain.</p>

        <p>In 1815 Landor settled in Italy, where he had his home for nearly thirty years.[1] From
          1835 to 1858 he lived in England (at Bath). Throughout his long life–he died in 1864, at
          the age of 90–he was the mortal enemy of tyranny in all its manifestations, and the
          ardent champion of freedom in everything. To the last he was the unwearied benefactor of
          political refugees and persons suffering for their opinions.</p>

        <p>The literary activity displayed during this long, honourable life was prodigious. Landor
          wrote twice as much as Byron. And it is with a feeling of reverence that we open many of
          his books; but during the whole literary period with which we are immediately concerned,
          his writings were neither understood nor valued. Landor wrote without any connection with
          a reading public, and without receiving any encouragement from the critics, who told him
          nothing but that he was stiff and cold, and that his English was like a translation from a
          foreign language; he never enjoyed the smallest amount of popularity or any species of
          literary triumph. After his death he began to be admired, and about 1870 to exercise
          influence.</p>

        <p>To pass from Moore to Landor is like setting foot on firm ground after rocking on the
          waves. Landor's distinguishing characteristic is a manly decision; he stands high as an
          author, but higher still as a man. He is, unfortun<pb n="197"/>ately, so little read that one cannot
          presuppose acquaintance with any of his writings, or find any point of support in the
          memory or fancy of one's reader on which to base criticisms; and he is not easy to
          describe. His decision found its most remarkable expression in an estimate of himself
          which is startling to many. We come upon such verdicts as this: »What I write is not
          written upon a slate: and no finger, not of Time himself, who dips it in the clouds of
          years, can efface it«; and upon such answers to the reviewers of his <emph>Imaginary
          Conversations</emph> as: »Let the sturdiest of them take the ten worst of them, and if he equals
          them in ten years I will give him a hot wheaten roll and a pint of brown stout for
          breakfast.« Such pride would have made a smaller man ridiculous, but it does not harm
          Landor; it occasionally becomes him. It reminds us at times of the not unjustifiable, but
          uncontrollably arrogant feeling which Schopenhauer had of his own deserts, only that
          Landor's manner is always that of the refined aristocrat, whilst Schopenhauer, with his
          utter disregard of the laws of common politeness, is a thorough plebeian. And on rare
          occasions the peculiar temperament, with its grand passionateness and its even grander
          productivity, reminds us of a man whose name is too great to be lightly named, but who,
          though infinitely Landor's intellectual superior, would perhaps have acknowledged the
          intellectual kinship–the solitary, severe Michael Angelo.</p>

        <p>There was something severe in Landor's nature–the severity which goes along with
          firmness of character and absolute truthfulness to one's self and others. In his work
          there is a certain salutary harshness. The poem »Hyperbion,« from the <emph>Hellenics</emph>, may be
          given as a good and very characteristic example of it.</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Hyperbion was among the chosen few</l>
          <l>Of Phœbus; and men honored him awhile,</l>
          <l>Honoring in him the God. But others sang</l>
          <l>As loudly; and the boys as loudly cheer'd.</l>
          <l>Hyperbion (more than bard should be) was wroth,</l>
          <l>And thus he spake to Phœbus: 'Hearest thou,</l>

          <l><pb n="198"/> Who swear that they have known thee ever since</l>
          <l>Thou feddest for Admetus his white bull?'</l>
          <l>'I hear them,' said the God. 'Seize thou the first,</l>
          <l>And haul him up above the heads of men,</l>
          <l>And thou shalt hear them shout for thee as pleas'd.'</l>
          <l>Headstrong and proud Hyperbion was: the crown</l>
          <l>Of laurel on it badly cool'd his brow:</l>
          <l>So, when he heard them singing at his gate,</l>
          <l>While some with flints cut there the rival's name,</l>
          <l>Rushing he seized the songster at their head:</l>
          <l>The songster kickt and struggled hard, in vain.</l>
          <l>Hyperbion claspt him round with arm robust,</l>
          <l>And with the left a hempen rope uncoil'd,</l>
          <l>Whereon already was a noose: it held</l>
          <l>The calf until its mother's teat was drawn</l>
          <l>At morn and eve; and both were now afield.</l>
          <l>With all his strength he pull'd the wretch along,</l>
          <l>And haul'd him up a pine-tree, where he died.</l>
          <l>But one night, not long after, in his sleep</l>
          <l>He saw the songster: then did he beseech</l>
          <l>Apollo to enlighten him, if perchance</l>
          <l>In what he did he had done aught amiss.</l>
          <l>'Thou hast done well, Hyperbion!' said the God,</l>
          <l>'As I did also to one Marsyas</l>
          <l>Some years ere thou wert born: but better 'twere</l>
          <l>If thou hadst understood my words aright,</l>
          <l>For those around may harm thee, and assign</l>
          <l>As reason that thou wentest past the law.</l>
          <l>My meaning was that thou shouldst hold him up</l>
          <l>In the high places of thy mind, and show</l>
          <l>Thyself the greater by enduring him.'</l>
          <l>Downcast Hyperbion stood: but Phœbus said:</l>
          <l>'Be of good cheer, Hyperbion! if the rope</l>
          <l>Is not so frayed but it may hold thy calf,</l>
          <l>The greatest harm is, that, by hauling him,</l>
          <l>Thou hast chafed sorely, sorely, that old pine;</l>
          <l>And pine-tree bark will never close again.'«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>Seldom has an Apollo expressed himself in a less sickly-sentimental manner on the subject
          of mediocrity in art. Landor's contempt for it was based on the severity of the artistic
          demands he made on himself. He is the severest stylist among English prose writers–not
          stylist in the sense of virtuoso in language, for no English is less flexible than
          his–but in this sense, that he represents all his characters, the most commonplace and
          the grandest, the ancient and the <pb n="199"/> modern, in the same simple Attic style. To his marked
          preference for the heroic and the grand is due the majestic tranquillity which as a rule
          characterises his <emph>Conversations</emph> (the branch of literature he specially cultivated); the
          dialogue is Grecian in its beautiful simplicity, Anglo-Roman in its proud decision. His
          style is pure, correct, concise; and its antique quality specially fits it for the
          representation of ancient Greek and Roman characters. The public assemblies in the
          market-place of Athens, the Senate and Forum of Rome, these live in his <emph>Conversations</emph>
          with the life of their own day. Modern dialogue flowed much less easily and naturally from
          his pen; he was successful in the more modern <emph>Conversations</emph> only when the situation was
          of such a nature as to be receptive of life and warmth from his own concealed
          indignation.</p>

        <p>To make acquaintance with Landor in his full vigour and brilliancy one must read his
          <emph>Pericles and Aspasia</emph>, a tale in epistolary form. It is a work of the same description as
          Wieland's <emph>Aristippus</emph>, but written in a very different spirit and style. Where Wieland is
          florid and coquettish, Landor is distinguished by manly grace; where Wieland is
          sentimental, Landor is noble and proud. This correspondence is chiselled rather than
          written; it represents Pericles as the republican type of noble humanity and political
          wisdom; and in it Aspasia is not the hetæra, but a personification of Hellenic beauty and
          delicacy of feeling, of pagan womanhood, and of the emancipated antique intellect and
          culture. There is consequently not a trace of anything resembling coquetry in the letters;
          everything that is small and undignified seems to lie beyond the horizon of the work and
          its author. But the old-fashioned epistolary form and the length of the letters make the
          book tedious, and the reader who has not enough patience for it will do well to turn from
          it to Landor's masterpiece, the Conversation between Epicurus, Leontion, and Ternissa.</p>

        <p>This Conversation is inferior to a dialogue of Plato only in profundity of thought; it
          rivals Plato in grace, in revelation of character, and in naturalness. The amiable
          philosopher, now approaching middle-age, is walking in his <pb n="200"/> beautiful garden with two young
          Greek girls, talking of the trivial events of the day and the serious events of life. An
          Attic atmosphere, a dignified sensuousness, a chaste and charming grace, distinguish the
          whole scene, striking us perhaps most in the little touches which describe the two girls,
          particularly the younger, aged sixteen, with her mixture of bashfulness and attractive
          straightforwardness. Landor has here created the feminine counterpart of Plato's youths;
          he has discovered the Greek maiden, whom Plato neglected, whom Greek tragedy represented
          only in solemn or majestically tragic situations, and whose outward appearance alone has
          been preserved for us in beautiful reliefs.</p>

        <p>One is well repaid for one's trouble in following the windings of this Conversation. It
          begins with a pretty description of the surrounding scene, and with praise of the solitude
          which is necessary to the man who desires to think, and to write his thoughts. Behind the
          figure of Epicurus we here catch a glimpse of Landor, who had this same love of a retired
          life, at a distance from the traffic and noise of the busy world. (See Conversation
          between Southey and Landor.) Then Epicurus discusses playfully and charmingly with
          Ternissa the question whether the myth of Boreas, Zethes, and Caläis is to be accepted
          literally or not, whilst the elder girl teases Ternissa because of her credulousness.
          After this the Conversation, touching lightly for a moment on the delicious scent of the
          vine-leaves and on the new olive plantations, turns into an affecting, profound discussion
          on the fear of death. The calm, dignified attitude of Epicurus arouses the girls'
          admiration, and leads them violently to upbraid those who condemn and persecute him as an
          atheist. It comes out that Leontion has written a whole book for the purpose of refuting
          the charges against him made by Theophrastus. Epicurus proves to her with gentle dignity
          how useless replies to such attacks are, and explains to her why he will contend with no
          one. »I would not contend even with men able to contend with me.... Whom should I contend
          with? The less? it were inglorious. The greater? it were vain.« Here we perceive Landor
          himself again. <pb n="201"/> This was the very argument of the man who a few years before his death
          prefixed to his last book the motto:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»I strove with none, for none was worth my strife:</l>
          <l>Nature I loved, and, next to nature, Art;</l>
          <l>I warmed both hands before the fire of life;</l>
          <l>It sinks, and I am ready to depart.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>The first of these lines contains both a confession and a justification of what appeared
          to be his arrogance–that which small minds found it so difficult to understand or to
          pardon. The second tells what was the chief subject of his earnest study, and what,
          supplementing it, came next in order. The third line is an expression of the noble
          philosophy which supported and nourished his spirit under so much misunderstanding and
          opposition; and the last shows him prepared, with the quiet dignity which harmonised with
          his character, to fold his mantle round him and depart when his time came.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">See <emph>The Centenary of Landor's Birth</emph> in <emph>The Examiner</emph> of 30th January 1875, an
            article written by the talented poet and critic, Edmund Gosse, who for us Danes possesses
            the special merit of being one of the most appreciative and best-informed foreign critics
            of Dano-Norwegian literature.</note></p>

        <p>Leontion continues the Conversation. »The old,« she says, »are all against you, for the
          name of pleasure is an affront to them: they know no other kind of it than that which has
          flowered and seeded, and of which the withered stems have indeed a rueful look. What we
          call dry they call sound; nothing must retain any juice in it: their pleasure is in
          chewing what is hard, not in tasting what is savoury.« Landor, who had to submit to
          reproaches for the licentiousness of his writings even from Byron (see preface to <emph>A
          Vision of Judgment</emph>), evidently derives his philosophy, as John Stuart Mill did his system
          of morality, from Epicurus, the pagan.</p>

        <p>The Conversation passes lightly from one subject to another; now it turns on Ternissa's
          blushes at the remembrance of the statues of satyrs and fauns in the bath chamber, now on
          Leontion's feminine objections to Aristotle and Theophrastus. It concludes in a genuinely
          Greek, Epicurean, <pb n="202"/> erotic manner; Epicurus and Ternissa act the scene between Peleus and
          Thetis, which ends with a kiss.</p>

        <p>In this Conversation we have Landor's art and his tranquil humanism at their best. But
          when we turn to the modern Conversations we become acquainted with the soldier in him, the
          writer ever armed, ever ready for the fray, who, assuming a thousand different disguises,
          exposes and strikes at every form of falsehood and oppression which challenges him to the
          attack in his character of pagan, republican, and philanthropist. In his 125 <emph>Imaginary
          Conversations</emph> he roams, displaying an astonishing amount of information, over the whole
          face of the earth–from London to China, from Paris to the South Sea Islands; and
          throughout the whole of history–from Cicero to Bossuet, from Cromwell to Petrarch, from
          Tasso to Talleyrand; in every country and every age uttering a vigorous protest against
          tyranny, and speaking a word, sharp as a sword, in the cause of liberty. We overhear what
          the Empress Catharine and her favourite maid of honour say to each other while they are in
          the act of murdering the former's husband; and the Conversation in question is not much
          inferior to one of Vitet's incomparable historical scenes, which are models in this style.
          We hear Louis XVIII, talking politics with the supercilious, polished Talleyrand, and
          notice how the uncontrollable longing for plenty of pheasants and pheasants' eggs twines
          itself, like a scarlet thread, through the web of all His Majesty's political plans. We
          listen to General Kleber talking with his staff-officers in Egypt, and are conscious of
          the dissatisfaction with Napoleon's tyrannical measures which runs, like a subdued murmur,
          through all they say. We are present at the assassination of Kotzebue, and hear Sandt, in
          the course of his attempts to induce Kotzebue to quit the path he is treading, pronounce
          his own acquittal.</p>

        <p>It was an article of Landor's political creed that the oppressor ought to fall by the
          sword. All his life he advocated the death of tyrants; he was not afraid openly to express
          his wish that Napoleon III. might be assassinated. He was a friend and spiritual kinsman
          of the great European revolutionists who, with Mazzini at their head, had sworn <pb n="203"/> implacable
          enmity to the oppressors of the nations. But it is not only as a politician that Landor
          shoots beyond the mark; by far the greater number of his historical Conversations suffer
          from the too open pursuit of some aim of his own. We are always catching sight of Landor
          himself. Take, for example, his representation of Catharine of Russia at the terrible
          moment above referred to: Landor cannot resist seizing the opportunity to discourse, in
          the disguise of Princess Dashkoff, on the ungodliness of Voltaire's character and the
          immorality of his <emph>Pucelle</emph>, with the aim of impressing upon us what a bad influence the
          French spirit had upon Russia. For with all his liberal-mindedness he is sufficiently the
          Englishman of his day to lay the blame of everything bad on France, and never to represent
          a Frenchman in any but a ridiculous or contemptible light. When, for example, he writes a
          Conversation between Louis XVIII, and Talleyrand, he cannot refrain from making his satire
          so severe–Louis' foolish speeches so imbecile, Talleyrand's tone to his sovereign so
          ironical–that no one can believe in the historic truthfulness of the whole. Landor
          desires to hear the English and Wellington praised, and desires to have Louis' incapacity
          plainly shown, and he is rash enough to put both the eulogy of England and the mockery of
          Louis into the mouth of the judicious French courtier.</p>

        <p>In the handling of the weapons of satire, Landor might have learned much from the
          Frenchmen whom he disliked so heartily. But he had as great a contempt for their
          literature as for their politics, and despised Voltaire, the author, quite as much as
          Voltaire, the man. In the Conversation between himself and the Abbé Delille he uses, as a
          critic of French tragedy, even severer language than Lessing, and shows no more
          appreciation than Lessing did of the great stylistic capacity inherent in the
          characteristically French intellect. It strikes us as comical to hear one man reproaching
          another with the utmost insolence for being too polished.</p>

        <p>One hardly needs to be told that a man with this opinion of French classic poetry was a
          despiser of Pope, an enthusiastic admirer of Milton, and a pronounced supporter of the <pb n="204"/> reform of English poetry demanded by Wordsworth. Most of the Conversations upon literary
          topics are written for the purpose of eulogising Wordsworth and Southey, and reproaching
          the reading public for its want of appreciation of such fine poetry as theirs.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">See, for example, the two Conversations between Southey and Porson, and the survey of
            the English poets in <emph>Miscellaneous</emph>, cxvi.</note> Keats
          and Shelley are also warmly praised; and Landor expresses regret that he had not made the
          personal acquaintance of either, and, in particular, that a false report concerning
          Shelley's behaviour to his first wife had kept him from calling upon that poet at Pisa. He
          writes of Shelley that he »united, in just degrees, the ardour of the poet with the
          patience and forbearance of the philosopher,« and that »his generosity and charity went
          far beyond those of any man at present in existence.« But no sooner is Byron mentioned
          than Landor expresses himself exactly like a poet of the Lake School. The man who believed
          that the two fingers which held his pen had more power than the two Houses of Parliament
          (see conclusion of the Conversation between Landor and Marchese Pallavicini) could never
          forget Byron's satire of his <emph>Gebir</emph>. And the remarkable friendship existing, in spite of
          all their political and religious differences, between him and Southey, made it equally
          impossible for him to forget the blows which Byron had struck at his admirer. Byron's
          egotism and excitable restlessness were, undoubtedly, antipathetic to Landor, but it was
          the treatment of Southey which influenced him most, and blinded him to many of the great
          poet's best qualities. The connection with Southey is, on the whole, little creditable to
          Landor, and Forster's long <emph>Life of Landor</emph> is rendered the more unreadable by the
          disproportionate space allotted in it to letters from and to such an uninteresting
          personage as Southey. In Landor's eyes Southey had the great, and certainly rare, merit of
          being one of the two persons who had read and bought the poem <emph>Gebir</emph> when it came out. De
          Quincey, who was the other, tells that in his youth he was hooted in the streets of Oxford
          as the one reader of that poem in the University. So we can understand how Southey, who
          not only bought and read, but praised it, and who, more<pb n="205"/>over, wrote a favourable review of
          Landor's dull <emph>Count Julian</emph> in the <emph>Quarterly</emph>, must have seemed to the self-satisfied
          author a man of the rarest intellectual penetration.</p>

        <p>It is undeniable that <emph>Gebir</emph>, in spite of all its passionate republicanism, is a
          stilted, valueless composition, which bears evident traces of having been, by a
          characteristic whim of its author, first written in Latin verse. There was, throughout, a
          Latin quality in Landor's verse. Even Gosse, who admires it, feels obliged to confess that
          its character, like the taste of olives, is peculiar enough to acquit any person who does
          not like it of the charge of affectation. It is in his prose alone that his strength
          lies.</p>

        <p>But a writer whose poetry is lacking in charm of expression and lyric soul, whose dramas
          were neither played nor read, and who found his true province in lengthy prose dialogue,
          spoken in all parts of the world and at all periods of history, but unconnected with any
          play–such a writer could not, however noble his principles and unmistakable his
          Radicalism, be the man to bring about a general European revulsion to liberal opinions. He
          repelled by his whimsicalities and crotchets, of which such instances may be given as his
          defence of the burning of Rome by Nero as a hygienic measure, his characterisation of Pitt
          as a mediocrity, and Fox as a charlatan, or, greatest absurdity of all, his advice to the
          Greeks, during their struggle with the Turks, to give up the use of firearms and resort to
          their old weapon, the bow. He was too peculiar and too much of the solitary to have
          admirers and imitators; he was too incomprehensible by the ordinary mind to exercise any
          influence upon the general public; his virtues contributed as much as his faults–his wild
          manliness as much as his excessive self-sufficiency–to render him unapproachable. And if
          he was incapable of compromising like Moore, that is to say, of ever becoming a Whig poet,
          he was equally incapable of ever imparting to his Radicalism a poetic form that would
          entrance and captivate a whole reading public. His partial understanding of the great
          modern movements in religion, government, and society, entitles him to be grouped with two
          younger and greater <pb n="206"/> men, Shelley and Byron. He fought for his ideals like a brave and
          proud republican soldier; but he was neither fitted to be a general nor to submit to rule;
          and he had not the power of inspiring a multitude of other minds.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">A satirical pamphlet which he published in 1836, <emph>Letters of a Conservative, in which
            are shown the only means of saving what is left of the English Church</emph>, made no
            impression.</note></p>

        <p>The eldest of the three freedom-loving exiles, he outlived the other two–lived so long,
          indeed, that he became the contemporary of an entirely different generation of English
          poets. Browning was his friend; Swinburne's cordial admiration sweetened the last years of
          his life; the dedication of <emph>Atalanta</emph> shows the young man's feelings towards the old.
          Landor's great shade, extending one hand to Wordsworth, the other to Swinburne, seems to
          hover over the whole poetic development of England during a period of not less than eighty
          years.</p>

        <p>If in the year 1820, any respectable, well-educated Englishman had been asked: »Who is
          Shelley?« he would undoubtedly, if he could answer the question at all, have replied: »He
          is said to be a bad poet with shocking principles and a worse than doubtful character. The
          <emph>Quarterly Review</emph>, which is not given to defamation, says that he himself is
          distinguished by 'low pride, cold selfishness, and unmanly cruelty' and his poetry by its
          frequent and total want of meaning.' He has lately published a poem called <emph>Prometheus
          Unbound</emph>, the verse of which the same review calls 'drivelling prose run mad.' And the
          press is unanimous in this opinion. The <emph>Literary Gazette</emph> writes that, if it were not
          assured to the contrary, it would take it for granted that the author of <emph>Prometheus
          Unbound</emph> was a lunatic–as his principles are ludicrously wicked, and his poetry is a
          mélange of nonsense, cockneyism, poverty, and pedantry. It calls the work in question 'the
          stupid trash of this delirious dreamer.'«</p>

        <p>And it is quite possible that our Englishman would have added, in an undertone: »There
          are very bad reports in circulation about Shelley. The <emph>Literary Gazette</emph>, which is always
          specially severe on the enemies of religion, hints at incest. It declares that 'to such a
          man it would be a matter of perfect indifference to rob a confiding father of his
          daughters, and incestuously to live with all the branches of a family whose morals were
          ruined by the damned sophistry of the seducer.' These expressions may be too strong, but
          it is hardly credible that they are entirely undeserved; for <emph>Blackwood's Magazine</emph>, the
          only periodical which has been at all favourable to Shelley, writes of his <emph>Prometheus</emph>;
          'It seems <pb n="208"/> impossible that there can exist a more pestiferous mixture of blasphemy,
          sedition, and sensuality.' And you may possibly have heard Theodore Hook's witty saying:
          '<emph>Prometheus Unbound</emph>–it is well named: who would bind it?'«</p>

        <p>And if, two years later, when this harshly reviewed poet was already dead, the same
          curious inquirer had applied to the publisher for information as to the saleableness of
          the fiercely attacked works, the latter would quite certainly have complained of them as a
          bad business speculation, and told his questioner that, during Shelley's lifetime, not a
          hundred copies of any of his works, except <emph>Queen Mab</emph> and <emph>The Cenci</emph>, had been sold, and
          that, as far as <emph>Adonais</emph> and <emph>Epipsychidion</emph> were concerned, ten would be nearer the
          number.</p>

        <p>If any one were to ask now: Who was Shelley? what a different answer would be given! But
          to-day there is no one in England who would ask.</p>

        <p>It was on the 4th of August 1792 that England's greatest lyric poet was born. On the same
          day on which, in Paris, the leaders of the Revolution–Santerre, Camille Desmoulins, and
          others–were meeting in a house on the Boulevards to make the arrangements which resulted,
          a few days later, in the fall of monarchy in France, there came into the world at Field
          Place, in the English county of Sussex, a pretty little boy with deep blue eyes, whose
          life was to be of greater and more enduring significance in the emancipation of the human
          mind than all that happened in France in August 1792. Not quite thirty years later his
          name–Percy Bysshe Shelley–was carved upon the stone in the Protestant cemetery in Rome
          under which his ashes lie; and below the name are engraved the words: <emph>Cor cordium</emph>.</p>

        <p><emph>Cor cordium</emph>, heart of hearts–such was the simple inscription in which Shelley's young
          wife summed up his character; and they are the truest, profoundest words she could have
          chosen.</p>

        <p>The Shelleys are an ancient and honourable family. The poet's father, Sir Timothy
          Shelley, was a wealthy landowner. He was a narrow-minded man, a supporter of the existing,
          for the simple reason that it existed. But revolt<!-- Illustration: P. B. SHELLEY --> <pb n="209"/> against rule and convention was
          hereditary in Shelley's family, as wildness and violence of temper were in Byron's.
          Percy's grandfather, a strange, restless man, eloped with two of his three wives; and two
          of his daughters in their turn eloped. Of these incidents we are reminded by similar
          occurrences in the life of the grandson–just as many an action of Byron's reminds us of
          the sum of untamed and reckless passionateness which was his indisputable inheritance from
          father and mother. Unconventionality, revolt against hard and fast rule, was, however, but
          an outward and comparatively unimportant part of Shelley's character and life. It was only
          a sign of the alert receptivity and the keen sensitiveness, the early development of which
          strikes every student of his biographies. At school, ill-used himself, he rebels against
          the ill-treatment to which, according to the prevalent English custom, the weaker and
          younger boys were subjected by the older boys, and in this case also by the masters.
          Shelley seems to have been in a very special manner the victim of this species of
          brutality, just as he was in later life of many other species; there was a natural
          antipathy between him and everything base and stupid and foul, and he never entered into a
          compromise with any one or any thing of this nature.</p>

        <p>We gain a distinct idea of what his impressions were on his entrance into life, from a
          fragment found after his death upon a scrap of paper:–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Alas! this is not what I thought life was.</l>
          <l>I knew that there were crimes and evil men,</l>
          <l>Misery and hate; nor did I hope to pass,</l>
          <l>Untouched by suffering, through the rugged glen.</l>
          <l>In mine own heart I saw as in a glass</l>
          <l>The hearts of others.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>He wrought for his soul, he tells us, »a linked armour of calm steadfastness.« But
          passionate indignation had preceded this mood of quiet resistance; and the soul which he
          armed with steadfastness was too enthusiastic and ardent not to lay plans of attack behind
          its defences.</p>

        <p><pb n="210"/> In the introduction to the <emph>Revolt of Islam</emph>, he recalls »the hour which burst his
          spirit's sleep«:–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»A fresh May-dawn it was,</l>
          <l>When I walked forth upon the glittering grass,</l>
          <l>And wept, I knew not why: until there rose</l>
          <l>From the near schoolroom voices that, alas!</l>
          <l>Were but one echo from a world of woes–</l>
          <l>The harsh and grating strife of tyrants and of foes.</l></lg>

        <lg>
          <l>And then I clasped my hands, and looked around:</l>
          <l>But none was near to mock my streaming eyes,</l>
          <l>Which poured their warm drops on the sunny ground.</l>
          <l>So, without shame, I spake: 'I will be wise,</l>
          <l>And just, and free, and mild, if in me lies</l>
          <l>Such power; for I grow weary to behold</l>
          <l>The selfish and the strong still tyrannise</l>
          <l>Without reproach or check.' I then controlled</l>
          <l>My tears, my heart grew calm, and I was meek and bold.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>The generation which was born at the same time and under the same planet as the first
          French Republic was precocious in its criticism of all traditional beliefs and
          conventions. Shelley, who at school saw tyranny and feigned piety attendant on one
          another, and who became acquainted at a very early age with the writings of the French
          Encyclopædists and of Hume, Godwin, and other English freethinkers, brooded deeply, long
          before he was grown up, on the history, the destiny, and the errors of the human race. His
          thoughts were the thoughts of an immature youth, but their spirit was the spirit of
          liberty, as understood by the eighteenth century.</p>

        <p>What his comrades remembered about him in later years was his defiant attitude towards
          authority, more particularly a habit he had of »cursing his father and the king.« He went
          among the boys by the name of »mad Shelley,« and »Shelley the atheist.« Thus early was the
          opprobrious word applied to him which was to be coupled with his name all his life, and
          serve as a pretext for abuse and defamation.</p>

        <p>It is unnecessary to dwell upon those events in Shelley's life of which every one who has
          heard his name has at least a superficial knowledge. We need merely recall to mind <pb n="211"/> the
          fact that, as the undergraduate of eighteen, he had the curious habit of writing down his
          heresies on such subjects as God, government, and society, in the form of letters, which
          he sent to people personally unknown to him, with the request that they would refute his
          theories and provide him with the proofs against his arguments which he himself was unable
          to find; that, out of these letters, which consisted chiefly of extracts from the works of
          Hume and the French materialists, grew a little anonymous pamphlet (no longer in
          existence) which was entitled <emph>The Necessity of Atheism</emph> and ended with a Q.E.D.; and that
          Shelley, in the childish hope of exercising a reforming influence on the spirit of his
          age, sent a copy of this pamphlet to the Bench of Bishops. What followed is equally well
          known. Shelley, denounced as the author, was not only expelled from the University, but
          from his father's house.</p>

        <p>No one nowadays considers that any serious scientific conviction, in whatever manner it
          may be expressed, should bring disgrace and punishment upon its exponent; and Shelley's
          punishment appears to us doubly unreasonable when we discover that in his pamphlet (the
          substance of which he reprinted in the notes to <emph>Queen Mab</emph>) he is no more an atheist
          than, for example, our Oersted is in his well-known work, <emph>The Spirit in Nature</emph>. He
          has not yet arrived at any logical and consistent theory of life; he is only clear on the
          one main point, that he is not, and never can become, an adherent of any so-called
          revealed religion. The materialistic impressions received from the books he has read are
          blent in his mind with the ardent pantheism which distinguished him to the last. When
          Trelawny asked him in 1822, the year in which he died: Why do you call yourself an
          atheist? Shelley replied: »I used the name to express my abhorrence of superstition; I
          took up the word, as a knight took up the gauntlet, in defiance of injustice.«</p>

        <p>Shelley had grown up tall and slight, narrow-chested, his features small and not regular
          except the mouth, which was beautiful, clever, and fascinating; there was a feminine and
          almost seraphic look in the eyes, and the whole face was distinguished by an infinite play
          of expression. He some<pb n="212"/>times looked the age he was–nineteen, sometimes as if he were
          forty. In the course of the ten remaining years of his life he became more manly in
          appearance, but still often struck people as boyish and feminine looking–witness
          Trelawny's surprise at his first meeting with Shelley: »Was it possible this mild-looking
          beardless boy could be the veritable monster at war with all the world, and denounced by
          the rival sages of our literature as the founder of a Satanic school?« His countenance
          assumed every expression–earnest, joyful, touchingly sorrowful, listlessly weary; but
          what it suggested most frequently in later years was promptitude and decision. He often
          expressed in his face the feeling he put into words in his poem <emph>To Edward Williams</emph>:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Of hatred I am proud,–with scorn content;</l>
          <l>Indifference, that once hurt me, now is grown</l>
          <l>Itself indifferent.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>To all this we may add, employing words used by a friend of his youth, that he looked
          »preternaturally intelligent«; and that Mulready, a distinguished painter of the day, said
          it was simply impossible to paint Shelley's portrait–he was »too beautiful.«</p>

        <p>It is, then, as a youth of this nature–excitable as a poet, brave as a hero, gentle as a
          woman, blushing and shy as a young girl, swift and light as Shakespeare's Ariel–that we
          must think of Shelley going out and in among his friends. Mrs. Williams said of him: »He
          comes and goes like a spirit, no one knows when or where.«</p>

        <p>His health was extremely delicate all his life, and would probably have given way
          altogether if he had not rigidly adhered to the simplest diet. About 1812 he adopted
          vegetarianism, with doubtful benefit. He was of a consumptive habit and subject to nervous
          and spasmodic attacks, which were sometimes so violent that he rolled on the floor in
          agony, and had recourse to opium to dull the pain; when he had his worst attacks he would
          not let the opium bottle out of his hand. When he was visiting the London hospitals and
          studying medicine with the aim of being able to assist <pb n="213"/> the poor, he himself became
          seriously ill, and an eminent physician prophesied that he would die of consumption. But
          his lungs completely righted themselves some years later. In 1817, in attending some of
          the poor in their cottages, he caught a bad attack of ophthalmia; and he had a relapse of
          the same malady at the end of the year, and another in 1821, each time severe enough to
          prevent his reading.</p>

        <p>The lofty philanthropy which to him was a religion, demanded many offerings. He displayed
          it wherever he went. When he was living at Marlow, in anything but affluent circumstances,
          he made all the poor of the neighbourhood his pensioners; they came to his house every
          week for their allowances, and he went to them when they were kept at home by sickness.
          One day he appeared barefooted at the house of a neighbour; he had given away his shoes to
          a poor woman. Of his own accord, almost immediately after his expulsion from Oxford, he
          gave up, for the benefit of his sisters, his claim to the greater part of his father's
          estate. At the time when he was enjoying an income of about £1000 a year, he spent most of
          it in assisting others, especially poor men of letters, whose debts he paid, and to whom
          he showed generosity almost unjustifiable in a man of his means.</p>

        <p>The story of his first marriage is as follows. Exaggerated and mistaken chivalry led him
          at the age of nineteen to elope with a schoolgirl of sixteen, named Harriet Westbrook, who
          was very much in love with him, and had complained bitterly to him of her father's
          ill-treatment of her (he had forbidden her to love Shelley, and tried to compel her to go
          to school!). Shelley, after various meetings with her, made his plans, carried her off to
          Scotland, and married her in Edinburgh. The censure of public opinion fell most severely
          on the poet for this behaviour; but W. M. Rossetti's remark is very much to the point,
          namely, that it would be interesting to know »what percentage of faultlessly Christian
          young heirs of opulent baronets would have acted like the atheist Shelley, and married a
          retired hotel-keeper's daughter offering herself as a mistress.« The hasty union,
          contracted without any proper consideration, proved an unhappy one; and it <pb n="214"/> was dissolved
          when, in 1814, Shelley made the acquaintance of Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, then in her
          seventeenth year, and was inspired by her with an irresistible passion. Mary Godwin, the
          daughter of Mary Wollstonecraft, the first famous pleader for the emancipation of woman,
          and of William Godwin, the free-thinking author of the works which had had such an
          influence on Shelley in his earliest youth, gave him her love frankly and freely, and in
          so doing acted strictly according to her own code of right. The young couple's theories of
          marriage, which were too ideal not to be regarded as vile by the vile, were also too
          impracticable. Although in their eyes mutual love alone, and not any ecclesiastical or
          civil formality, constituted the sacred marriage tie, they nevertheless for practical
          reasons, and especially for the sake of their children, went through the customary
          marriage ceremony in 1816, after the suicide of Shelley's first wife. Before this they had
          been twice abroad, first on a short tour, great part of which was taken on foot, and then
          for a longer period of travel, during which they met Byron. Shelley's name was,
          accordingly, coupled with Byron's, and the English press attacked them both with the
          utmost fury, going so far as to put a shameful interpretation on their noble and manly
          friendship.</p>

        <p>Southey found occasion for a perfect explosion of abuse in the circumstance,
          insignificant and harmless enough, that Shelley had written in the album kept for visitors
          at the Chartreuse at Montanvert in the valley of Chamounix, below a number of pious
          platitudes about »Nature and Nature's God,« the following incorrectly spelt hexameter line:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>είμι ϕιλάνϑρωπος δημωκράτικός τ΄ άϑεός τε<!-- [2] --></l>
          <l>PERCY B. SHELLEY.</l>
        </lg></quote></cit><!-- det græske rettet efter den danske vers., som Finn har tjekket --><!-- skal højrestilles -->
        
        <p>The well-known outburst against Lord Byron, which has been already touched on, has this
          utterance as its point of departure.</p>

        <p>Such is, given in a few words, the overture to Shelley's life and poetry.</p>

        <p><emph>Cor cordium</emph> was his rightful appellation–for what he understood and felt was the
          innermost heart of things, their <pb n="215"/> soul and spirit; and the feelings to which he gave
          expression were those inmost feelings, for which words seem too coarse, and which find
          vent only in music or in such verse as his, which is musical as richly harmonised
          melodies.</p>

        <p>The suppressed melancholy of Shelley's lyrics sometimes reminds us of Shakespeare. The
          little spinning song in <emph>The Cenci</emph>, for example, recalls Amiens' song in <emph>As You like It</emph>
          or the songs of Desdemona and Ophelia.</p>

        <p>But where Shelley is most himself he surpasses Shakespeare in delicacy; and there is no
          other poet with whom he can be compared; no one surpasses him. The short poems of 1821 and
          1822 are, one may venture to say, the most exquisite in the English language.</p>

        <p>Take as a specimen the little poem entitled <emph>A Dirge</emph>:–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Rough wind that moanest loud</l>
          <l>Grief too sad for song;</l>
          <l>Wild wind when sullen cloud</l>
          <l>Knells all the night long;</l>
          <l>Sad storm whose tears are vain,</l>
          <l>Bare woods whose branches stain.</l>
          <l>Deep caves and dreary main,</l>
          <l>Wail for the world's wrong!«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>And wondrous in melody and restraint of expression is a verse like this:–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»One word is too often profaned</l>
          <l>For me to profane it;</l>
          <l>One feeling too falsely disdained</l>
          <l>For thee to disdain it;</l>
          <l>One hope is too like despair</l>
          <l>For prudence to smother;</l>
          <l>And pity from thee more dear</l>
          <l>Than that from another.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>The words are few, and there is nothing remarkable in the rhythm, yet there is not a line
          that could have come from any pen but Shelley's.</p>

        <p>In these short poems we are clearly conscious of the poet's melancholy, a melancholy
          which in his longer works is veiled, or else overpowered by his belief in a bright future,
          his faith in the progress of the human race. The inmost <pb n="216"/> recesses of his own being were
          penetrated by a sadness produced by the feeling of the mutability of everything, and by
          early experience of the manner in which feeling leads astray, love disappoints, and life
          deceives.</p>

        <p>He has given imperishable expression to the feeling of mutability:–</p>

        <cit><quote>
          <lg><l>»The flower that smiles to-day</l>
            <l>To-morrow dies:</l>
              <l>All that we wish to stay</l>
            <l>Tempts and then flies.</l>
            <l>What is this world's delight?</l>
            <l>Lightning that mocks the night.</l>
            <l>Brief even as bright.</l></lg>

        <lg>
          <l>Virtue, how frail it is!</l>
          <l>Friendship how rare!</l>
          <l>Love, how it sells poor bliss</l>
          <l>For proud despair!</l>
          <l>But we, though soon they fall,</l>
          <l>Survive their joy, and all</l> 
          <l>Which ours we call.</l></lg>

        <lg> 
          <l>Whilst skies are blue and bright,</l> 
          <l>Whilst flowers are gay,</l>
          <l>Whilst eyes that change ere night</l>
          <l>Make glad the day,</l>
          <l>Whilst yet the calm hours creep,</l>
          <l>Dream thou–and from thy sleep</l>
          <l>Then wake to weep.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>The first verse indicates the transitoriness of all earthly beauty and happiness; the
          second, the suffering that lies concealed in the very happiness; and the third is an
          exhortation to enjoy the dream of happiness as long as possible.</p>

        <p>A mood of like nature has found expression in the incomparable poem which bears the
          simple title, <emph>Lines</emph>. This poem Shelley could not have written unless one after another
          of his own fond beliefs had evaporated, unless his passions for Harriet, for Mary, for
          Emilia Viviani, had ended in a sorrowful awakening. Yet it bears no trace of being a
          personal confession. It is an impassioned proclamation of <pb n="217"/> the universal laws of life,
          first softly hummed, and then sung in a voice which has never had its equal.</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>

        <p>The lines on the human heart in the third verse are as condensed as a couplet of Pope's
          and as melodious as bars of Beethoven:–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»O, Love, who bewailest</l>

          <l>Why chose you the frailest</l>
          <l>For your cradle, your home, and your bier?«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>And the poem ends with this prophecy, in which we can hear the passions that have taken
          possession of the heart taking their wild will with it:–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Its passions will rock thee,</l>

          <l>From thy nest every rafter</l>
          <l>Will rot, and thine eagle home</l>
          <l>Leave thee naked to laughter</l>
          <l>When leaves fall and cold winds come.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>A certain characteristic of Shelley, one which readers who know him only from anthologies
          will at once cite as his chief characteristic, seems to be strongly at variance with this
          unexampled personal intensity. I refer to the well-known fact that the most famous of his
          lyric poems are inspired by subjects outside of the emotional life, nay, outside of the
          world of man altogether; they treat of the cloud and the gale, of the life of the
          elements, of the marvellous freedom and stormy strength of wind and water. <pb n="218"/> They are
          meteorological and cosmical poems. Yet there is no real contradiction in the most
          intimately emotional of lyric poets being, to all appearance, the most occupied with
          externals. We find the reason for it given by Shelley himself in a short essay <emph>On Love</emph>.
          He describes the essence of love as an irresistible craving for sympathy: »If we reason,
          we would be understood; if we imagine, we would that the airy children of our brain were
          born anew within another's; if we feel, we would that another's nerves should vibrate to
          our own, that lips of motionless ice should not reply to lips quivering and burning with
          the heart's best blood. This is Love ... The meeting with an understanding capable of
          clearly estimating our own; an imagination which should enter into and seize upon the
          subtle and delicate peculiarities which we have delighted to cherish and unfold in secret
          ... this is the invisible and unattainable point to which Love tends.... Hence in
          solitude, or in that deserted state when we are surrounded by human beings, and yet they
          sympathise not with us, we love the flowers, the grass, the waters, and the sky.... There
          is eloquence in the tongueless wind, and a melody in the flowing brooks which bring tears
          of mysterious tenderness to the eyes, like the voice of one beloved singing to you
          alone.«</p>

        <p>In a note on <emph>The Witch of Atlas</emph>, Mrs. Shelley, too, writes that it was the certainty of
          neither being able to arouse the sympathy nor win the approbation of his countrymen, in
          combination with a shrinking from opening the wounds of his own heart by portraying human
          passion, which led her husband to seek forgetfulness in the airiest flights of fancy.</p>

        <p>It was this very craving for a sympathy which his fellow-creatures refused him, that made
          his feeling for nature an ardent desire, and gave it its wonderful originality. Such a
          thing was unknown in English poetry. The stiff, artificial school of Pope had been
          superseded by the Lake School. Pope had perfumed the air with affectation; the Lake School
          had thrown open the windows and let in the fresh air of the mountains and the sea. But
          Wordsworth's love of nature was passionless, whatever he may say to the contrary in <pb n="219"/> <emph>Tintern Abbey</emph>. Nature was to him an invigorator and a suggester of Protestant
          reflections. That meanest flower which gave him thoughts that often lay too deep for
          tears, he put into his buttonhole as an ornament, and looked at sometimes in a calmly
          dignified manner, revolving a simile. Shelley flees to nature for refuge when men shut
          their doors upon him. He does not, like others, feel it to be something entirely outside
          of himself–cold, or indifferent, or cruel. Its stony calm where man's woe and weal are
          concerned, its divine impassibility as regards our life and death, our short triumphs and
          long sufferings, are to him benevolence in comparison with man's stupidity and brutality.
          In <emph>Peter Bell the Third</emph> he jeers at Wordsworth because in the latter's love of nature it
          was »his drift to be a kind of moral eunuch«; he himself loves her like an ardent lover;
          he has pursued her most secret steps like her shadow; his pulse beats in mysterious
          sympathy with hers. He himself, like his Alastor, resembles »the Spirit of Wind, with
          lightning eyes and eager breath, and feet disturbing not the drifted snow.«</p>

        <p>He calls animals and plants his beloved brothers and sisters, and compares himself, with
          his keen susceptibility and his trembling sensitiveness, to the chameleon and the
          sensitive plant. In one of his poems he writes of the chameleons, which live on light and
          air, as the poet does on love and fame, and which change their hue with the light twenty
          times a day; and compares the life led by the poet on this cold earth with that which
          chameleons might lead if they were hidden from their birth in a cave beneath the sea. And
          in one of the most famous of all he tells how</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»A Sensitive Plant in a garden grew;</l>
          <l>And the young winds fed it with silver dew;</l>

          <l>And closed them beneath the kisses of night.</l>

          <l><pb n="220"/> But the Sensitive Plant, which could give small fruit</l>
          <l>Of the love which it felt from the leaf to the root,</l>
          <l>Received more than all; it loved more than ever,</l>
          <l>Where none wanted but it, could belong to the giver:–</l></lg>

        <lg>

          <l>Radiance and odour are not its dower;</l>
          <l>It loves even like Love,–its deep heart is full;</l>
          <l>It desires what it has not, the beautiful.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>Even more characteristically, even more personally, does Shelley's inmost feeling, his
          heart's heart, such as it became after hard fate had set its stamp upon it, express itself
          in the beautiful elegy on Keats, which was written in a frame of burning indignation
          produced by the base and rancorous attack in the <emph>Quarterly Review</emph>. He is describing how
          all the poets of the day come to weep over their brother's bier:–</p>

            <l>Whose thunder is its knell. He, as I guess,</l>
            <l>Had gazed on Nature's naked loveliness</l>
            <l>Actæon-like; and now he tied astray</l>
            <l>With feeble steps o'er the world's wilderness,</l>
            <l>And his own thoughts along that rugged way</l>
            <l>Pursued like raging hounds their father and their prey.</l></lg>

        <lg> 
          <l>A pard-like Spirit beautiful and swift–</l>

          <l>The weight of the superincumbent hour.</l>
          <l>It is a dying lamp, a falling shower,</l>
          <l>A breaking billow;–even whilst we speak</l>

          <l>Vibrated, as the ever-beating heart</l>
          <l>Shook the weak hand that grasped it. Of that crew</l>
          <l>He came the last, neglected and apart;</l>
          <l>A herd-abandoned deer struck by the hunter's dart.</l></lg>

        <lg>
          <l><pb n="221"/> All stood aloof, and at his partial moan</l>
          <l>Smiled through their tears. Well knew that gentle band</l>

          <l>As in the accents of an unknown land</l>

          <l>The Stranger's mien, and murmured, 'Who art thou?'</l>

          <l>Which was like Cain's or Christ's–Oh I that it should be so.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>Shelley here compares himself to Actæon, whom the sight of Nature's naked loveliness
          drove distracted. It is plain that the strength of his strong will was required to keep
          this man with the fragile, delicate body from positive destruction by the visions and
          apparitions of his imagination. He often felt as if they were more than his brain could
          bear; and when he then, an exile in a foreign land, sought alleviation in solitude, he
          experienced such impressions of nature as that which is preserved in the entrancing
          <emph>Stanzas Written in Dejection near Naples</emph>, stanzas which contain the very essence of
          Shelley's poetry. He does not describe the landscape. He never does describe. It is not
          the outward forms and colours of things which he shows us, but that to which he is
          extraordinarily alive, what we have called their spirit and soul.</p>

        <p>One or two touches, and the Bay is before us:–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»The sun is warm, the sky is clear,</l>

</lg></quote></cit>
        
        <p>The waves break upon the shore »like light dissolved, in star-showers thrown.« The
          lightning of the noontide ocean is flashing, and a tone arises from its measured motion.
          »How sweet,« cries the poet, »did any heart now share in my emotion!«</p>

        <lg>
          <l>Yet now despair itself is mild,</l>
          <l>Even as the winds and waters are;</l>

          <l>And weep away the life of care</l>
          <l>Which I have borne and yet must bear,–</l>
          <l>Till death like sleep might steal on me;</l>
          <l>And I might feel in the warm air</l>
          <l>My cheek grow cold, and hear the sea</l>
          <l>Breathe o'er my dying brain its last monotony.</l></lg>

        <lg>
          <l>Some might lament that I were cold,</l>
          <l>As I when this sweet day is gone,</l>
          <l>Which my lost heart, too soon grown old,</l>
          <l>Insults with this untimely moan.</l>
          <l>They might lament–for I am one</l>
          <l>Whom men love not, and yet regret;</l>
          <l>Unlike this day, which, when the sun</l>
          <l>Shall on its stainless glory set,</l>
          <l>Will linger, though enjoyed, like joy in memory yet.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>The man over whose dying brain cruel waves were so soon to close, feels, with a gentle
          mournfulness, his being dissolve into the beneficent elements of nature, and compares his
          last breath to that of the beautiful southern summer day. He did not, like Byron, love
          nature only in its agitated, wild moments; simple of heart himself, he loved its
          simplicity, its holy calm.</p>

        <p>But this is not his most characteristic feature. Himself of the race of Titans and
          giants, he loves the Titanic and gigantic beauty of nature–his manner of doing so again
          differing entirely from Byron's. It is not the tangible, easily accessible poetry of
          nature, that of the flowers of the field or the trees of the forest, which inspires him at
          his highest. No! the finest inspirations of his great spirit are received from the grand
          and the distant, from the forceful motions of the sea and the air and the dance of the
          spheres in the firmament of heaven. In this familiarity with the great phenomena and the
          great vicissitudes of nature Shelley resembles <pb n="223"/> Byron, but he resembles him as a fair
          genius resembles a dark, as Ariel resembles Lucifer the Son of the Morning.</p>

        <p>The poetry of the sea was to Byron the poetry of shipwreck, of the raging hurricane, of
          the insatiable cry of the waves for prey; to him the poetry of the sky lay in the howling
          of the storm, the roaring of the thunder, the crackle of the lightning. It is nature as
          the annihilator that he lives with and glories in. The famous passage in the Fourth Canto
          of <emph>Childe Harold</emph>, beginning: »Roll on, thou deep and dark blue Ocean, roll!« is a
          jubilant record of the sea's exploits in sweeping argosies from its surface and sinking
          empires into its depths. It boasts that nothing longer-lived than a bubble tells where man
          has gone down. The passage is like a prelude to the magnificent Deluge scene which is
          entitled <emph>Heaven and Earth</emph>, and which is a glorification of the lust of
          annihilation.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Swinburne, who in his masterly little essay on Byron points out that Byron and
            Shelley were engrossed by the same natural phenomena, does not note the difference which
            existed along with the similarity.</note></p>

        <p>After such verse read Shelley's famous poem, <emph>The Cloud</emph>. In it we hear all the
          elementary forces of nature playing and jesting, with the gaiety of giants, benevolent
          giants, who joy in pouring bounteous gifts upon the earth. What freshness in the
          lines:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»I bring fresh showers for the thirsty flowers</l>

          <l>From the depth of heaven above,</l>
          <l>With wings folded I rest on mine airy nest,</l>
          <l>As still as a brooding dove.«</l></lg></quote></cit></l>

        <p>What consciousness of power in:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»From cape to cape, with a bridge-like shape,</l>

          <l>Is the million-coloured bow.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>Yet the real spirit of the Cloud is playfulness, the playfulness of a child. Even when
          the sun has swept it from the sky, it only laughs:–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»I silently laugh at my own cenotaph,–</l>
          <l>And out of the caverns of rain,</l>
          <l>Like a child from the womb, like a ghost from the tomb,</l>
          <l>I arise, and unbuild it again.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>It is not only the unlikeness to Byron's gloomy passion which strikes us in the sublime
          childlikeness and bounty and all-embracing love of this Cloud; there is another
          characteristic in this poetry, which we shall merely mention here, and devote more
          attention to later, namely, its antique, its absolutely primitive, spirit. We are reminded
          of the most ancient Aryan poetry of nature, of the Vedas, of Homer. <pb n="225"/> In comparison with
          this, Byron is altogether modern. When the Cloud sings:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»That orbèd maiden with white fire laden</l>
          <l>Whom mortals call the Moon,</l>
          <l>Glides glimmering o'er my fleece-like floor</l>
          <l>By the midnight breezes strewn!</l>
          <l>And wherever the beat of her unseen feet</l>
          <l>Which only the angels hear,</l>
          <l>May have broken the woof of my tent's thin roof,</l>
          <l>The Stars peep behind her and peer;«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>and when it speaks of »the sanguine Sunrise, with his meteor eyes,« the poet transports
          us, by the primitive freshness of his imagination, back to the time when the phenomena of
          nature in all their newness were transformed into myths.</p>

        <p>To Shelley these phenomena were ever new. He lived among them in a way which no poet had
          done before or has done since. By far the greater part of his short life of thirty years
          was spent under the open sky. The sea was his passion; he was constantly sailing; his most
          beautiful poems were written while he lay in his boat with the sun beating on him,
          browning his soulful face and delicate hands. It was a passion that was the pleasure of
          his life and the cause of his death. Everything that had to do with boats and sailing had
          an attraction for him. He had a childlike hobby for floating paper boats; it is said that
          on one occasion, having no other paper at hand, he launched a £50 bank-note on the pond in
          Kensington Gardens.</p>

        <p>He never learned to swim. At the time when he was constantly, by day and by night,
          sailing on the Lake of Geneva with Lord Byron, their boat was once very nearly upset.
          Shelley refused all help, and calmly prepared himself to go down. »I felt in this near
          prospect of death,« he afterwards wrote, in a mixture of sensations, among which terror
          entered, though but subordinately. My feelings would have been less painful had I been
          alone, but I knew that my companion would have attempted to save me, and I was overcome
          with <pb n="226"/> humiliation when I thought that his life might have been risked to preserve mine.« A
          few years later he had no painful feelings at all in contemplating such an end. When some
          months before his death, Trelawny rescued him from drowning, all he said was: »It's a
          great temptation; if old women's tales are true, in another minute I might have been in
          another planet.«</p>

        <p>In Italy he lived in the open air; now he would be riding with Byron in the country near
          Venice, Ravenna, or Pisa; now spending whole days in a rowing-boat on the Arno or the
          Serchio; now out at sea in his yacht. It is interesting to observe how frequently a boat
          serves him as a simile. He wrote often out at sea, very seldom under the shelter of a
          roof. <emph>Prometheus</emph> he wrote in Rome, upon the mountainous ruins of the Baths of Caracalla;
          wandering among the thickets of odoriferous trees on the immense platforms and dizzy
          arches, he was inspired by the bright blue sky of Rome and the vigorous, almost
          intoxicating, awakening of spring in that glorious climate. <emph>The Triumph of Life</emph> he wrote
          partly on the roof of his house at Lerici, partly lying out in a boat during the most
          overpowering heat and drought. Shelley belonged to the salamander species; broiling
          sunshine was what suited him best.</p>

        <p>It was while lying in a grove on the banks of the Arno, near Florence, that he wrote the
          most magnificent of his poems, the <emph>Ode to the West Wind</emph>.</p>

        <p>In its first stanza the wind is the breath of autumn, driving the dead leaves, »yellow,
          and black, and pale, and hectic red, pestilence-stricken multitudes«; and of spring,
          filling »with living hues and odours plain and hill«–we hear it blowing, and we hear its
          echo in the appealing refrain: »Hear, oh hear!«</p>

        <p>In the second stanza we are again reminded of the old mythologies, when the poet sings of
          the loose clouds on the Wind's stream, »shook from the tangled boughs of heaven and
          ocean,« and of »the locks of the storm« spread on the blue surface of the airy surge »like
          the bright hair uplifted from the head of some fierce Mænad.«</p>

        <p><pb n="227"/> But along with the breath of the West Wind we have Shelley's whole soul in the final
          outburst:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Oh! lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud!</l>
          <l>I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed!</l>

          <l>One too like thee–tameless, and swift, and proud.</l></lg>

        <lg> 
          <l>Make me thy lyre, even as the forest is:</l>
          <l>What if my leaves are falling like its own?</l>

        <p>There could not be a better example of the difference between the attitude towards nature
          of an all-embracing and an all-defying poetic intellect. Shelley does not, like Byron, <pb n="228"/> desire to possess himself of her thunderbolts. He loves her, not as his weapon, but as his
          lyre; loves her, unappalled by her gigantic proportions, familiar with her prodigious
          forces, feeling that the universe is his home. His imagination delights in occupying
          itself with the heavenly bodies; he is fascinated by their beauty and life as others are
          by the beauty of the forget-me-not and the rose.</p>

          <l>Ha! leapest thou forth as of old?</l>

        <p>With the eyes of his soul Shelley beheld the soulèd spheres circling in space, glowing
          within, sparkling without, lighting up the night; his gaze sounded the unfathomable
          abysses where verdant worlds and comets with glittering hair, and pale, ice-cold moons,
          glide past each other. He compares them to the drops of dew which fill the flower chalices
          in the morning; he sees them whirl, world after <pb n="229"/> world, from their genesis to their
          annihilation, like bubbles on a stream, glittering, bursting, and yet immortal, ever
          generating new beings, new laws, new gods, bright or sombre–garments wherewith to hide
          the nakedness of death. He sees them as Raphael painted them in Rome in the church of
          Santa Maria del Popolo, each governed and guided by its angel; and, wielding the absolute
          poetic power of his imagination, he assigns to the unfortunate Keats, lately dead, the
          throne of a yet kingless sphere.</p>

        <p>His Witch of Atlas has her home in the ether. Like Arion on the dolphin, she rides on a
          cloud, »singing through the shoreless air,« and »laughs to hear the fire-balls near
          behind.« In this poem Shelley plays with the heavenly bodies like a juggler with his
          balls; in <emph>Prometheus Unbound</emph> he opens them as the botanist opens a flower. In the Fourth
          Act of <emph>Prometheus</emph> the earth is represented transparent as crystal; the secrets of its
          deep heart are laid bare; we see its wells of unfathomed fire, its »water-springs, whence
          the great sea even as a child is fed,« its mines, its buried trophies and ruins and
          cities. Shelley's genius hovers over its surface, inhaling the fragrant exhalations of the
          forests, watching the emerald light reflected from the leaves, and listening to the music
          of the spheres. But to him the earth is not a solid, composite sphere; it is a living
          spirit, in whose unknown depths there slumbers an unheard voice, the silence of which is
          broken when Prometheus is unbound.</p>

        <p>When Jupiter has fallen, has sunk into the abyss, the Earth and the Moon join in an
          exulting antiphon, a hymn of praise that has not its equal. The Earth exults over its
          deliverance from the tyranny of the Deity; the Moon sings its burning, rapturous love-song
          to the Earth–tells how mute and still it becomes, how full of love, when it is covered by
          the shadow of the Earth. Its barrenness is at an end:–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>

          <l>Within, two lovers linked innocently</l>
          <l>In their loose locks which over both did creep</l>

        <p>Shelley feels with the streams, which are loved by the sea and disappear in his depths;
          he sings by the death-bed and bier of nature in autumn and winter; he remembers the
          flowers that were strewn over Adonis; he describes the goddess of the summer and of
          beauty, who (like a female Balder) tends the flowers of the gardens; and he paints the
          progress of the Spirits of the Hours through the heavens (<emph>Arethusa, Hymn of Apollo, Hymn
          of Pan, Autumn, The Sensitive Plant</emph>, the Hours in <emph>Prometheus Unbound</emph>),</p>

        <p>For everything in life and nature he has found the fitting poetic word–for the waste and
          solitary places,</p>

          <l>»Where we taste</l>

        <p>The whole poem in which these last words occur ought to be read. Into it, in a sad mood,
          he has compressed all his love of nature. It is called simply <emph>Song</emph>, and is addressed <pb n="231"/> to
          the Spirit of Delight. This Spirit, the poet complains, has deserted him; it forgets all
          but those who need it not; and such an one as he, can never win it back again, for it is
          dismayed with sorrow, and reproach it will not hear. Yet, he goes on to say,</p>

          <l>Spirit of Delight!</l>

          <l>And the starry night,</l>
          <l>Autumn evening, and the morn</l>
          <l>When the golden mists are born.</l></lg>

        <lg> 
          <l>I love snow, and all the forms</l>

          <l>Untainted by man's misery.</l></lg>

        <lg> 
          <l>I love tranquil solitude.</l>
          <l>And such society</l>
          <l>As is quiet, wise, and good.</l>
          <l>Between thee and me</l>
          <l>What difference? But thou dost possess</l>
          <l>The things I seek, not love them less.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>But Shelley's spirit rises on the wings of his sublime enthusiasm for liberty high into
          the clear air above all these mournful moods. His ode <emph>To a Skylark</emph>, the poem which
          indicates the transition to the poetry of liberty, is written in a perfect intoxication of
          joy and freedom from care. It is almost safe to assert that there had been nothing in the
          older English literature finer in its way than the best of Wordsworth's songs to the lark,
          which are so typical of the spirit and art of the Lake School.</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>

          <l>A privacy of glorious light is thine,«</l></lg></quote></cit>

          lark as</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Type of the wise, who soar, but never roam–</l>

        <p>We seem to hear all the winds ringing with its »shrill delight,« and seem to glide into
          and be engulfed by a sea of eternally fresh melody. This is the youngest, freshest,
          gladdest pæan of the pure spirit of freedom. It forms the transition to the long series of
          poems of freedom, the great group of works in which Shelley's genius is the loud herald of
          the approaching revolutions. His poetry of freedom is one long war-cry, garbed in
          ever-changing melodies. Whether it takes the shape of odes to liberty and its champions
          (poems as beautiful and grand as the Marseillaise), of political satires levelled at
          customs or persons, of Aristophanic comedy ridiculing the abuses and follies of the day in
          England, or of mythical or historical tragedy, it is in its essence always the same mighty
          wail over injustice and hypocrisy, the same powerful appeal to all of his contemporaries
          who were still capable of feeling anything whatsoever a degradation.</p>

        <p>Immediately after his first marriage Shelley began to play the part of a political
          agitator. He went to Dublin to further the cause of Catholic emancipation, wrote a very
          juvenile address to the Irish people, in which he besought them to refrain from the
          violent deeds with which the French Revolution had been stained, and was childish enough
          to throw down copies of it from the balcony of his hotel, in front of any of the
          passers-by who looked as if they might be responsive. We gain some idea of the childish
          spirit in which both he and his young wife regarded the matter, from reading that, one day
          when they were walking together, he could not resist amusing himself by popping the
          address into the hood of a lady's cloak, a performance which made his wife, as she herself
          writes, »almost die of laughing.« Shelley attended several political meetings, and on one
          occasion spoke for more than an hour in the presence of <pb n="233"/> O'Connell and other celebrities.
          The accounts of his eloquence given by contemporaries are so enthusiastic that they might
          almost lead us to believe him to have been even greater as an orator than as a poet.</p>

        <p>The next time Shelley came into collision with the party in power, the collision was of a
          much more violent and tragic nature. Harriet was dead, and her father had filed a petition
          in Chancery to determine which was the fit and proper person to educate her children–he,
          their grandfather, the retired hotel-keeper, or their father, Shelley, the author of
          <emph>Queen Mab</emph> and <emph>Alastor</emph>, who was accused of atheism, and would in all probability bring
          up his children as atheists.</p>

        <p>Lord Eldon's judgment was to the effect that, seeing that Shelley's conduct had hitherto
          been highly immoral, and that, far from being ashamed of this, he was proud of his immoral
          principles and tried to impress them upon others, the law was in its right in depriving
          him entirely of the custody of his children, and at the same time decreeing that he should
          be deprived of a fifth of his income for their maintenance. The children were placed in
          charge of a clergyman of the Church of England. Shelley felt this blow so terribly that
          even his most intimate friends never dared speak of the children to him.</p>

        <p>In his poem <emph>To the Lord Chancellor</emph> he cries:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»I curse thee by a parent's outraged love;</l>
          <l>By hopes long cherished and too lately lost;</l>
          <l>By gentle feelings thou could'st never prove;</l>
          <l>By griefs which thy stern nature never crossed.</l>
          <l>…</l>
          <l>By the false cant which on their innocent lips</l>
          <l>Must hang like poison on an opening bloom;</l>
          <l>By the dark creeds which cover with eclipse</l>
          <l>Their pathway from the cradle to the tomb.</l>
          <l>…</l>
          <l>(By) the despair which bids a father groan,</l>
          <l>And cry, 'My children are no longer mine;</l>
          <l>The blood within those veins may be my own,</l>
          <l>But, tyrant, their polluted souls are thine.'«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p><pb n="234"/> And in the poem to William Shelley, his little son by Mary, he writes:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»They have taken thy brother and sister dear,</l>
          <l>They have made them unfit for thee;</l>
          <l>They have withered the smile and dried the tear</l>
          <l>Which should have been sacred to me.</l>
          <l>To a blighting faith and a cause of crime</l>
          <l>They have bound them slaves in youthly time;</l>
          <l>And they will curse my name and thee</l>
          <l>Because we are fearless and free.</l>
          <l>…</l>
          <l>Fear not the tyrants will rule for ever,</l>
          <l>Or the priests of the evil faith;</l>
          <l>They stand on the brink of that raging river</l>
          <l>Whose waves they have tainted with death.</l>
          <l>It is fed from the depths of a thousand dells,</l>
          <l>Around them it foams and rages and swells;</l>
          <l>And their swords and their sceptres I floating see</l>
          <l>Like wrecks, on the surge of eternity.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>Fearing that this son of his second marriage might also be taken from him, Shelley left
          his native country, never to return. At the time when the Lord Chancellor was branding him
          as less fit for the most rudimentary duties of social life than any other man in England,
          he was preparing to prove that he was one of the few men then in existence who were
          predestined to immortality. He left England, stamped as a criminal, and most of the
          Englishmen whom he met abroad feared and hated him as capable of any crime. He appears to
          have been actually once or twice subjected to personal molestation.</p>

        <p>As already mentioned, Shelley in 1817 published a pamphlet on the subject of
          Parliamentary Reform. As a proof of the moderation and practicability of the views
          elaborated in its pages, it need only be mentioned that the Tories in 1867 passed almost
          the very scheme of Reform which the »atheist and republican« had planned fifty years
          before. He »disavowed any wish to establish universal suffrage at once, or to do away with
          monarchy and aristocracy.« And on many other occasions he declared himself to be against
          precipitate changes. His Radicalism consisted simply in his being fifty years ahead of his
          day.</p>

        <p><pb n="235"/> Attacked and persecuted by the narrow-minded society of the period, Shelley now hurled
          his poems of liberty at England. His political poems are written with his blood. The
          employment of such similes for Castlereagh and Sidmouth as »two bloodless wolves whose dry
          throats rattle« and »two vipers tangled into one,« was allowable in his case. It must not
          be forgotten that to him Castlereagh, Sidmouth, and Eldon, were not men, but
          personifications of a principle–of the great, fateful principle of reaction to which his
          career and his happiness had been sacrificed. He writes in <emph>The Masque of Anarchy</emph>:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»I met Murder on the way–</l>
          <l>He had a mask like Castlereagh.</l>
          <l>Very smooth he looked, yet grim;</l>
          <l>Seven bloodhounds followed him.</l>
          <l>…</l>
          <l>Clothed with the bible as with light,</l>
          <l>And the shadows of the night,</l>
          <l>Like Sidmouth next, Hypocrisy</l>
          <l>On a crocodile came by.</l>
          <l>…</l>
          <l>One fled past, a maniac maid,</l>
          <l>And her name was Hope, she said,</l>
          <l>But she looked more like Despair;</l>
          <l>And she cried out in the air:</l></lg>

        <lg>
          <l>'My father Time is weak and grey</l>
          <l>With waiting for a better day;</l>
          <l>See how idiot-like he stands,</l>
          <l>Fumbling with his palsied hands!</l></lg>

        <lg> 
          <l>'He has had child after child,</l>
          <l>And the dust of death is piled</l>
          <l>Over every one but me–</l>
          <l>Misery! oh Misery!'«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>It was not, however, only in bellicose lyrics that Shelley incorporated his political and
          social ideas and passions at this period. In the year 1818 he wrote two very
          characteristic narrative poems, <emph>Julian and Maddalo</emph> and <emph>Rosalind and Helen</emph>. The
          first-mentioned gives a vivid description of the poet's life in Venice with Byron, and
          affords one of the many proofs of his noble and ardent admiration for Byron's <pb n="236"/> poetry. It
          contains an account of a visit paid by the two friends to a lunatic asylum in the
          neighbourhood of Venice and describes the impression produced upon Shelley. The man »whose
          heart a stranger's tear might wear as water-drops the sandy fountain-stone,« and who
          »could moan for woes which others hear not,« could not but be deeply moved by compassion
          for the unfortunates who at that time were still kept in fetters and punished by
          flogging.</p>

        <p>We gain the best idea of the utter want of understanding of mental disease in those days,
          and the barbarity displayed in its treatment, from reading of the manner in which an
          insane patient of such rank as King George the Third was treated in 1798. The King's
          mental alienation displayed itself chiefly in excessive talkativeness; there was no
          inclination to any kind of violence. Nevertheless from the very beginning, and throughout
          the whole duration of the attack, he was kept in a strait-waistcoat, was closely confined,
          deprived of the use of knife and fork, and subjected to the whims of his pages, who
          knocked him about, struck him, and used abusive language to him. All this is known because
          the King retained a distinct remembrance after his recovery of what had happened during
          his illness.</p>

        <p>Shelley's gentleness and love of his fellow-men are evident in the plea which he,
          ignorant of the humaner treatment of the insane inaugurated in France during the
          Revolution, utters for these afflicted ones:</p>

          <l>»Methinks there were</l>

        <p>The second poem, <emph>Rosalind and Helen</emph>, which gives a powerful general impression of the
          misery which prejudice and intolerance have brought upon the human race, has not hitherto
          been properly understood or valued according to its deserts. It attempts to give a
          comprehensive representation of all that truly good and liberal-minded human beings have
          to suffer from antiquated ideas and principles in combination with human malignity. We
          have the description of a father who was a coward to the strong, a tyrant to the weak;
          hard, <pb n="237"/> selfish, false, rapacious; the torturer of his wife and terror of his children, who
          became pale and silent if they heard, or thought they heard, his footstep on the stair. He
          dies, and Rosalind, the mother, is distressed because her children involuntarily rejoice
          at their father's death, and because she herself cannot but feel it to be a relief. The
          dead man had been strictly orthodox. He has, as it appears when his will is read, decreed
          that the children shall inherit nothing if they continue to live with their mother,
          because she secretly holds the Christian creed to be false, and he must save his children
          from eternal fire. The mother feels that she must leave her children. »Thou know'st,« she
          says–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Thou know'st what a thing is poverty</l>
          <l>Among the fallen on evil days.</l>
          <l>'Tis crime, and fear, and infamy,</l>
          <l>And houseless want in frozen ways</l>
          <l>Wandering ungarmented, and pain,</l>
          <l>And, worse than all, that inward stain,</l>
          <l>Foul self-contempt, which drowns in sneers</l>
          <l>Youth's starlight smile, and makes its tears</l>
          <l>First hot like gall, then dry for ever.</l>
          <l>And well thou know'st a mother never</l>
          <l>Could doom her children to this ill,–</l>
          <l>And well he knew the same.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>Rosalind's fate serves, above all else, to show the misery of an unhappy marriage, more
          particularly the wife's condition of dependence on a bad and tyrannical husband. Shelley's
          own grief over the loss of his children is also distinctly perceptible in the poem; and
          Helen's fate recalls the persecution to which the author in his character of philosopher
          was subjected. The whole representation of Lionel's life and ideas is self-representation.
          Could there be a better description of Shelley's own love of his fellow-man than
          this:–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»For love and life in him were twins,</l>
          <l>Born at one birth. In every other,</l>
          <l>First life, then love, its course begins,</l>
          <l>Though they be children of one mother.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>Young, rich, well-born, Lionel at the time of the Revolution enthusiastically takes his
          place in the ranks of the reformers <pb n="238"/> whose aim it is to emancipate humanity from the
          tyranny of creeds.</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Men wondered, and some sneered to see</l>
          <l>One sow what he could never reap:</l>

          <l>And might drink from the depths of luxury.</l>
          <l>If he seeks Fame, Fame never crowned</l>

          <l>Those who would sit near Power must toil.'«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>The reaction comes:</p>

          <l>»None now hoped more. Grey Power was seated</l>

          <l>Even to its blood-stained steps dragged on</l>
          <l>Her foul and wounded train; and men</l>
          <l>Were trampled and deceived again.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>Lionel's enemies succeed in imprisoning him because he has blasphemed their gods. He
          passes a long time in solitary confinement, separated from the woman he loves. Then he
          meets her again, and they celebrate their nuptials under the starry sky.</p>

        <p><emph>Rosalind and Helen</emph> is a poem which bears traces of having been written in a mood of
          profound despair; in no other work does Shelley go to such extremes in his war upon all
          traditional law and convention. We have, in a previous volume of this work, touched upon the fact that many writers at the beginning of this century occupied themselves with the
          theory that the horror of incest has its source in prejudice. Both in <emph>Rosalind and Helen</emph>
          and in <emph>The Revolt of Islam</emph>, the hero and heroine of which would, but for the earnest
          entreaties of the publisher, have been brother and sister, Shelley wasted much eloquence
          on this sinister paradox–which also greatly occupied Byron's mind, and was to give
          occasion to a foolish and revolting attack upon his memory.</p>

        <p>The year 1820 was the year of the scandalous royal divorce case. On the 8th of April
          1798, the Prince Regent, <pb n="239"/> compelled by his position to marry, had wedded Princess Caroline
          of Brunswick. So little regard did he show from the very beginning for even the decencies
          of the situation, that at their first meeting in St. James's Palace, when the Princess was
          kneeling before him, he called to Lord Malmesbury: »Get me a glass of brandy! I don't feel
          well.« Lord Malmesbury asked if a glass of water would not be preferable, upon which the
          Prince rushed out of the room, swearing, without a word to his fiancée. He was drunk at
          the wedding, and hiccupped incessantly during the ceremony. Ere long he was not content
          with displaying the utmost indifference to his wife and slighting her by his liaisons with
          numbers of other women, but actually treated her with great brutality–kept her in
          confinement, surrounded her with spies, and, on the ground of a false accusation, took her
          daughter from her, a proceeding which gave occasion to constant scenes at court. The
          Princess's conduct does not seem to have been long irreproachable. She was at first only
          incautious, but in course of time sought consolation in behaviour which was neither
          blameless nor dignified. At the age of fifty she was travelling all over Europe in the
          company of her courier and chamberlain Bergami–a man who had formerly been her
          footman–an Italian Ruy Blas, on whom she conferred one honour and order after another,
          and whom she loved devotedly.</p>

        <p>When, at the time of her husband's accession to the throne, she returned to England,
          expecting to be crowned Queen, the miserable, contemptible sovereign determined to employ,
          in procuring a divorce, all the evidence against her which he had obtained by means of
          paid spies. She was accused before the House of Lords of unfaithfulness. Whole shiploads
          of foreign hotel waiters and chambermaids were landed in England amidst the angry
          demonstrations of the populace, to give witness against the Queen. Anything more indecent
          than this trial it would be difficult to find. Investigations into the positions of
          bedrooms and beds, descriptions of the clothing or absence of clothing of a Queen and her
          chamberlain, filled the English newspapers day after day until–the accusation was
          withdrawn; partly <pb n="240"/> on account of the supposed insufficiency of the proofs, partly on
          account of the pitch which public contempt for the King, as the author of the scandal, had
          reached.</p>

        <p>It was this divorce case which gave occasion to Shelley's excellent satire, <emph>Œdipus
          Tyrannus</emph>, or <emph>Swellfoot the Tyrant</emph>, an essay in political comedy. The action of the play
          passes in Bœotia. A people, who call themselves <emph>Bulls</emph> (<emph>i.e.</emph> John Bulls), nevertheless
          make their appearance as pigs; consequently, the nature and power and spirit of the
          English are comprehensively expressed by the word <emph>piggishness</emph>:–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»The taxes, that true source of piggishness</l>
          <l>(How can I find a more appropriate term</l>
          <l>To include religion, morals, peace, and plenty,</l>
          <l>And all that fit Bœotia as a nation</l>
          <l>To teach the other nations how to live?)</l>
          <l>Increase with piggishness itself.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>The hypocrisy of the royal husband, the Queen's impudent asseverations of her own
          chastity, the hypocritical attitude of Castlereagh and Sidmouth–all this is caricatured
          with the pen of a master.</p>

        <p>But Shelley's genius was not of a nature to spend much of its force in satirising the
          distortions of the age. Untrammelled and ethereal, it was supremely fitted to present to
          the intellects of the day a glorious conception of the century's ideal of liberty.</p>

        <p>And from his boyhood this had been the aim of all Shelley's endeavours. His first works
          were long, melodious, but, unfortunately, formless poems, which are in their essence
          protests against kings and priests, against the religions which »people the earth with
          fiends, hell with men, and heaven with slaves,« against the injustice of governments and
          the servility of the administrators of the law, against compulsory marriages, against the
          exclusion of women from free competition in bread-winning occupations, against cruelty in
          the slaughtering of animals. They are protests, in short, against every form of oppression
          and intolerance, written with no less ambitious an aim than the reformation of humanity,
          which is to be brought about by <pb n="241"/> showing it how it may remove the causes of its misfortunes
          and attain to a state which, in comparison with the existing, would be a true golden
          age.</p>

        <p>Shelley had, as he himself laughingly acknowledges, »a passion for reforming the world.«
          In spite of his aversion for didactic poetry, it was (as he puts it in the preface to <emph>The
          Revolt of Islam</emph>) his object to excite in his reader a generous impulse, an ardent thirst
          for excellence.</p>

        <p>»The panic,« he writes, »which, like an epidemic transport, seized upon all classes of
          men during the excesses consequent upon the French Revolution, is gradually giving place
          to sanity. It has ceased to be believed that whole generations of mankind ought to consign
          themselves to a hopeless inheritance of ignorance and misery, because a nation of men who
          had been dupes and slaves for centuries were incapable of conducting themselves with the
          wisdom and tranquillity of freemen so soon as some of their fetters were partially
          loosened.... If the Revolution had been in every respect prosperous, then misrule and
          superstition would lose half their claims to our abhorrence, as fetters which the captive
          can unlock with the slightest motion of his fingers, and which do not eat with poisonous
          rust into the soul.«</p>

        <p>Shelley's purpose was to set forth the principles of the Revolution in a transfigured
          form. Hence his poetry became a sermon; his imagination embodied, not his observations,
          but his wishes.</p>

        <p>He was firmly persuaded that imagination is the true reformatory power. The man whom
          crass ignorance has reviled as a materialist had, in the school of Hume and Berkeley,
          saturated himself with the extremest idealism. To him everything was thought–things were
          layers of thoughts; the universe itself was but a gigantic coagulation of old thoughts,
          images, ideas. Hence it is that the poet, whose calling it is to create new imagery of the
          kind which makes the strongest impression, is always agitating, disturbing, remodelling
          the world. »Imagination,« says Shelley, »is the faculty of human nature on which every
          gradation of its progress–nay, every, the minutest, change–<pb n="242"/>depends.« Either by gently
          inducing the congealed ideas to flow again, or by forcibly breaking through the crust of
          outworn opinions, the poet shows himself to be the true reformer.</p>

        <p>In his youth devoted to philosophy, but indifferent to history, Shelley, during the one
          completed period of his life–that preceding the writing of <emph>The Cenci</emph>–sought no
          foundation in time or space for his visions of reformation; being merely desires, they had
          no historic reality. And this deficiency entails the absence of various essential
          qualities in his personages, which only historical and local relations can confer. The
          qualities they do possess are mainly the deepest seated, original qualities of human
          nature. In constructing his characters, he goes back to the earliest records of the race.
          They are half mystical personages–gigantic, vaguely outlined, spiritualised figures; no
          ordinary human sympathies can lay hold of them, for the reason that »history«–what the
          ordinary mind regards as the interesting element in a poem–is despised and ignored by
          Shelley. Hence his unsuitability for the multitude. An author like Sir Walter Scott will
          never cease to find a public among all who can read; Shelley will always be the author
          only of the few elect.</p>

        <p>When, however, Shelley chooses a theme suited to his peculiar turn of mind he produces
          poetry of the very highest rank. His productive gift, from the point of view from which we
          are now considering it, was of the Greek type; and the same may be said of his religious
          feeling and of the whole development of his imaginative and reasoning powers. »We are all
          Greeks,« he says somewhere. It was true of himself.</p>

        <p>It was, however, only the earliest Greek poetry which treated of such natural phenomena,
          such gods, and such heroes as we find in Shelley's; therefore it is only with it that his
          is to be compared. Shelley's lyrics remind us of the Homeric hymns; his political comedy
          recalls Aristophanes both by its reckless satire and the lyric vigour of its songs, and is
          worthy of comparison with Aristophanes; it remains to be told that in serious drama he was
          a worthy rival of <pb n="243"/> Æschylus. His <emph>Prometheus Unbound</emph> is the modern counterpart of the
          Greek tragedian's <emph>Prometheus Bound</emph>; his <emph>Hellas</emph>, a prophecy of the triumph of Greece,
          the modern counterpart of <emph>The Persians</emph>.</p>

        <p>Let us linger for a moment over <emph>Prometheus</emph>, the magnificent poem in which his poetry of
          freedom culminates. In Prometheus, Shelley at last found, and succeeded in representing,
          the typical figure of his poetry and his period. Many types had passed through his mind,
          amongst others Job and Tasso, who at this time were also engrossing the imagination of
          Byron and Goethe. He chose Prometheus. High above the lakes and hills of contemporaneous
          English poetry, Byron's Alps with his Manfred, and Shelley's Caucasus with his Prometheus,
          soar into the sky.</p>

        <p>Ever since the emancipation of the human mind had begun in real earnest, this typical
          figure had given occupation to all the great poets. It suggests itself about the beginning
          of our century to Goethe, Byron, and Shelley. Goethe's beautiful poem represents the
          labours, the artistic productivity, of the human spirit which has freed itself from faith
          in gods–the man, proud of his hut, which no god built for him, occupied in forming
          figures in his own image. Goethe's Prometheus is the creative and free. Byron's hard,
          short, fiery lines describe the martyr who suffers with clenched teeth, silently; from
          whom no torture can extract confession, and whose ambition it is that no one shall divine
          his sufferings; this is a Titan who would never, in the manner of the Prometheus of the
          ancients, have accepted consolation from the daughters of Oceanus or told his woes to
          them. Byron's is the defiant and bound Prometheus.</p>

        <p>Shelley's resembles neither of these. His is the beneficent human spirit which, warring
          with the principle of evil, is for an immeasurable length of time held in subjugation and
          tortured by it–and not by it alone, but by all other beings, even the good, who are
          fooled into accepting evil as necessary and right. He is the spirit who can only for a
          time be imprisoned and fettered; long as that time may be, the day <pb n="244"/> comes when, to the joy
          of all, he is released–he is Prometheus unbound, Prometheus triumphant, greeted by the
          acclamations of all the elements and all the heavenly spheres.</p>

        <p>Even during his sufferings he is perfectly calm; for he knows that Jupiter's reign is but
          a passing period in the life of the universe. He would not exchange his place of torture
          for all the voluptuous joys of Jupiter's court. When the Furies »laugh into his lidless
          eyes,« and threaten him, he only says:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»I weigh not what ye do, but what ye suffer,</l>
          <l>Being evil.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>How differently a Byronic Prometheus would have answered! This Titan is full of
          love–love for his enemies and for the whole human race. Nor have his sufferings closed
          his heart to the more earthly love passion. In the midst of his agony he remembers his
          bride–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Asia, who, when my being overflowed,</l>
          <l>Wert like a golden chalice to bright wine.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>Asia is nature herself, who loves the Titan. She is the child of light, the life of life,
          whose</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»lips enkindle</l>
          <l>With their love the breath between them,</l>
          <l>And whose smiles, before they dwindle,</l>
          <l>Make the cold air fire.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>When the age of suffering and injustice has passed, Jupiter sinks into the abyss of
          eternity, with cowardly wails and supplications to Prometheus to have mercy on him. The
          Promethean age begins; the air becomes a sea of sweet, eternally new love melodies; the
          mighty, deep-toned jubilation of the Earth is heard in alternation with the Moon's
          enchanting song of bliss; and then the whole universe chimes in in a chorus of rejoicing
          unsurpassed even by that with which Beethoven's Ninth Symphony ends.</p>

        <p>We cannot do much more than allude to the fact that <pb n="245"/> Shelley, after competing with
          Æschylus, began to produce on Shakespeare's lines. Taking a sudden excursion into the
          realms of history, he gave England what even Byron pronounced to be the best tragedy
          written by any of her sons since the days of Shakespeare. <emph>The Cenci</emph> reminds the reader
          slightly of such a play as <emph>Measure for Measure</emph>, although Shakespeare was not possessed
          by the ardent hatred of tyranny which inspired Shelley's play.</p>

        <p>To the Romans the name of Beatrice Cenci is to this day the great symbol of liberty. The
          young girl who defended her honour against her atrocious father (whose deed of violence
          was indirectly sanctioned by the corruption of the rulers of the country from the Pope
          downwards) is still regarded by the Roman as a heroine and martyr. Whenever, during the
          long oppression of the Papacy, there has been a little clearing of the air, a little
          brightening of the horizon, her name has been heard, her picture has circulated, in Rome.
          Shelley, forgetting all theories, is here entirely absorbed by history. But what evidently
          impressed him in this tragic collision of duties, was the violent break with all
          traditional morality which the father's crime necessitated; and he was also attracted by
          the opportunity the situation offered for throwing a glaring search-light on the accepted
          theological doctrine of the paternal benevolence displayed in the regulation of the
          universe. Beatrice says:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Thou great God,</l>
          <l>Whose image upon earth a father is,</l>
          <l>Dost thou indeed abandon me?«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>And when she is asked:</p>

        <p> »Art thou not guilty of thy father's death?«</p>

        <p>She answers:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Or wilt thou rather tax high-judging God</l>

          <l>Made it unutterable, and took from it</l>
          <l>All refuge, all revenge, all consequence,</l>
          <l>But that which thou hast called my father's death?«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p><pb n="246"/> In the torture chamber she says:</p>

        <p>It is plain that what specially attracted Shelley in Beatrice's character was its
          combination of energy and gentleness. When the hour of death has come, a horror seizes her
          at the thought that after death she may meet her father again. She cries:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»If there should be</l>
          <l>No God, no heaven, no earth, in the void world,</l>

          <l>If all things then should be my father's spirit,</l>

        <p>It was of this, the most mature and best planned of Shelley's works, that the <emph>Literary
          Gazette</emph> wrote: »<emph>The Cenci</emph> is the most abominable work of the time, and seems to be the
          production of some fiend.« The reviewer hopes never <pb n="247"/> again to see a book »so stamped with
          pollution, impiousness, and infamy.«</p>

        <p>The hostility evinced depressed Shelley, who thought that this time he had done his best.
          He was not intimidated by it, but his desire to produce became less strong. During the
          last two years of his life no long works came from his pen. In November 1820 he writes:
          »The reception the public have given me might go far to damp any man's enthusiasm.«</p>

        <p>His last letters are full of remarks on the criticism meted out to him.</p>

        <p><emph>April</emph> 1819:–»As to the Reviews, I suppose there is nothing but abuse; and this is not
          hearty enough or sincere enough to amuse me.«</p>

        <p><emph>March</emph> 1820:–»If any of the Reviews abuse me, cut them out and send them; if they
          praise, you need not trouble yourself. I feel ashamed if I could believe that I should
          deserve the latter: the former, I flatter myself, is no more than a just tribute.«</p>

        <p>In 1821 he writes the poem on Keats with the terrible outburst against the reviewer who
          is supposed to have been the cause of the young poet's death:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Hot shame shall burn upon thy secret brow,</l>
          <l>And like a beaten hound tremble thou shalt–as now.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p><emph>June</emph> 1821:–»I hear that the abuse against me exceeds all bounds. Pray, if you see any
          one article particularly outrageous, send it me. As yet, I have laughed; but woe to these
          scoundrels if they should once make me lose my temper. I have discovered that my
          calumniator in the <emph>Quarterly Review</emph> was the Reverend Mr. Milman. Priests have their
          privilege.«</p>

        <p><emph>August</emph> 1821:–»I write nothing, and probably shall write no more.«</p>

        <p>Byron, when his enemies irritated him, stopped his work for a moment and showed them the
          lion's claw. Shelley was of a different nature. The satire of the reviewers contained in
          his <emph>Peter Bell the Third</emph> is sportiveness in comparison with Byron's sanguinary attacks
          on Southey <pb n="248"/> and the others. Whenever Shelley made his appearance the creeping things of
          literature began to swarm and stir beneath his feet. They stung his heel; he could not
          bruise their heads, for such creatures have, as Swinburne has observed, too little head to
          be perceived and bruised. Byron's poetry had, moreover, made for him friends and admirers
          by the thousand; he shared Parnassus with Goethe; he had begun to set the stamp of his
          spirit on the continent of Europe. Shelley was too far in advance of his age. The crowd
          will follow a leader who marches twenty steps in advance; but if he is a thousand steps in
          front of them, they do not see and do not follow him, and any literary freebooter who
          chooses may shoot him with impunity.</p>

        <p>Moore was a man of great talent, and exercised influence as such. What Shelley had was
          not talent, either great or small, but genius. He was the very genius of poetry; and he
          had all the power which genius gives; where he fell short was in his grip of reality. He
          has influenced the succeeding generations of English poets throughout this whole century,
          but he had not the twentieth part of the merely talented Moore's influence upon his own
          contemporaries. Byron was, as none had ever been before, the poet of personality, and as
          such was excessively egotistic; prejudice and vanity could not in his case be entirely
          eradicated without nobler qualities suffering from the process. Shelley, perfectly free
          from vanity and egotism, was absorbed in his ideals; he expanded his Ego until it embraced
          the universe. But what was ideal virtue in him as a man entailed a fatal defect in his
          poetry, at any rate in the works produced during the first part of his too short life.
          This poet, so devoid of all thought of self, was long entirely deficient in
          self-restraint. A sense of form as regarded a great composition in its entirety was for
          many years denied him. In making his first appearance as a poet he stumbled over the
          threshold, and it takes more than genius to make the reading public forget such an
          entrance. <emph>The Revolt of Islam</emph>, with all the beauty of its detail, is vague and formless;
          it hovers transcendentally in the air. With its shadowy, bloodless characters, it is
          distended to such proportions that it is a <pb n="249"/> task to read it to the end; and it was a task
          which few accomplished. Until Shelley wrote <emph>The Cenci</emph> he seems to have had no idea of
          the infinite attractiveness and infinite value of the characteristics of the individual.
          Even Prometheus and Asia in their quality of types are destitute of any peculiarly
          distinguishing feature; their names are merely headings to the most beautiful lyric verse
          which England has ever produced. <emph>The Cenci</emph> shows how capable Shelley was of acquiring
          what he was naturally deficient in; but, alas! he was carried off before he could fulfil
          the rich promise of his youth, and before his contemporaries had had their eyes opened to
          what they possessed in him. Although his shorter lyrics surpass in depth and freshness,
          naturalness and charm, everything else in the shape of lyric poetry that the century has
          produced, they could not influence his own generation, as most of them were not even
          printed during his lifetime.</p>

        <p>Thus Shelley was no more capable than Moore or Landor of bringing about the spiritual
          revolution of which Europe stood in need and expectancy. It required a poet who was as
          personal as Shelley was universal, as passionate as Shelley was idealistic, as savagely
          satirical as Shelley was harmonious and graceful, to perform the Herculean task of
          clearing the political and religious atmosphere of Europe, awaking the slumberers, and
          plunging the mighty into the abyss of ridicule. A man was required who could win the
          sympathies of his age alike by his vices and his virtues, his excellences and his faults.
          Shelley's instrument was an exquisite violin; a trumpet was what was needed to pierce the
          air and give the signal for battle.</p>

        <p>Little remains to be told of Shelley's life–only the story of his last sail from Leghorn
          to Lerici, of the sudden gale in which he perished, of the long days spent by his
          despairing wife in searching the coast, and of the discovery of the almost unrecognisable
          corpse. The Tuscan law required any object thus cast ashore to be burned. Shelley's body
          was committed to the flames by Byron and Trelawny with Grecian and pagan observances that
          were in harmony with his character. Frankincense, wine, salt, and oil, were poured <pb n="250"/> on the
          fuel. The day was beautiful and the surroundings were glorious–the calm sea in front, the
          Apennines behind. A curlew wheeled round the pyre, and would not be driven away. The flame
          arose golden and towering. The body was consumed, but, to the surprise of all, the heart
          remained entire. Trelawny snatched it from the glowing furnace, severely burning his hand.
          The ashes were deposited near the Pyramid of Cestius in Rome, which Shelley had spoken of
          as an ideal resting-place.</p>

        <p>The first-mentioned of the men who consigned his body to the flames was his spiritual
          heir. This man's name is to be read on every page of the history of his day. We see his
          way prepared by Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Scott; he is hated by Southey, misunderstood by
          Landor, loved by Moore, admired, influenced, and sung by Shelley. He occupies a place in
          every one's life. It is he who sets the final and decisive stamp on the poetical
          literature of the age.</p>

        <head><pb n="[251]"/> XVII. BYRON: THE PASSIONATE PERSONALITY</head>

        <p>Entering the Thorvaldsen Museum in Copenhagen, and turning to the right, the first work
          that meets one's eye is the marble bust of a noble-looking young man, with beautiful
          features and curly hair–the bust of Lord Byron. In room No. 12 we find the same work in
          plaster, and in No. 13 stands the statue executed (after Byron's death) from the bust. Let
          us examine the plaster bust, which is without doubt the most speaking likeness. Beauty and
          distinction are the first qualities that strike us in this head and face; but the next
          moment we are attracted by an expression of energy, which comes chiefly from a restless
          quiver of the brow–indicating that clouds might gather on it and lightning flash from the
          clouds–and from something imperiously compelling in the glance. This brow betokens
          irresistibility.</p>

        <p>When one remembers the dissimilarity of Thorvaldsen's and Byron's natures, remembers that
          in all probability Thorvaldsen never read a line of Byron's poetry, and also that the poet
          did not show his best side to the sculptor, the result of the meeting of the two great men
          must be regarded as extraordinarily satisfactory. The bust gives what is necessarily a
          feeble and incomplete, but nevertheless a true and beautiful representation of a main
          aspect of Byron's character which one would hardly have expected Thorvaldsen to grasp. The
          idyll is that sculptor's real province. When he sets himself to represent Alexander's
          triumphal entry into Babylon, he is much more successful with the shepherds, the sheep,
          the fishermen, the women, the children, the procession in general, than with the hero
          himself; the heroic is not to the same extent his affair; how much less, then, the <pb n="252"/> combatant nature in the complicated, modern form of it which has been dubbed the dæmonic.
          And yet he understood Byron. In the bust (not in the statue) he has given the world a
          monument of him, which, although it satisfied neither the Countess Guiccioli nor Thomas
          Moore, is worthy both of the poet and of the artist. If Thorvaldsen had really known
          Byron, the work would probably have been still better; the face would have had a touch of
          the frankness and attractiveness which impressed all who knew him well. This is absent.
          But the Danish sculptor has succeeded in penetrating into what lay beneath the gloomy
          expression which he considered an assumed one, and showing us the suffering, the
          restlessness, the genius, the noble and terrible power.</p>

        <p>It was, undoubtedly, with the Byron of the Museum that the next generation to his in
          Denmark grew up. But the image presented to them there was invariably connected in their
          minds with the story of the poet's visit to Thorvaldsen's studio, and with the latter's
          observation: »It was his fancy to be unhappy;«<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Thiele: <emph>Thorvaldsen i Rom</emph>. i. 342.</note> and they wondered why such a great man
          should not have been perfectly natural. And so the first attitude of the Danes to Byron
          was a wrong, or at any rate an uncertain one. And an uncertain one it still remains. He is
          little fitted to be the hero of the present age. The very things which were much more
          effectual than his greatness as a poet in arousing the admiration of our grandfathers and
          grandmothers, are the things that repel the present generation–all those mythical
          traditions (which really obscure his history to us) of Byron the stage hero, with the tie
          which every one imitated; Byron, the hero of romance, whose pistols were his constant
          companions, and whose amorous adventures were as famous as his verse; Byron, the
          aristocrat, with the title which he valued so highly, but which makes little impression on
          a generation that recognises no aristocracy but that of the intellect. And our practical
          age has, moreover, a distinct contempt for what Byron sometimes imagined his honour
          required him to be, and sometimes really was–the dilettante.</p>

        <p><pb n="253"/> It was a matter of honour with him to practise his art in a non-professional manner. His
          position and his pursuits (so he writes in the preface to his first volume of poetry) make
          it highly improbable that he will ever take up the pen again. In 1814, at the very summit
          of the celebrity won for him by his first narrative poems, he determines to write no more
          poetry, and to suppress all that he has written. A month afterwards he writes <emph>Lara</emph>.
          Jeffrey criticised the character of the hero as too elaborate. Byron asks (in a letter of
          1822): »What do they mean by '<emph>elaborate?</emph>' I wrote <emph>Lara</emph> while undressing after coming
          home from balls and masquerades, in the year of revelry 1814.« We feel that he lays stress
          on the careless manner of production and the planlessness consequent thereon, from a
          desire to show that he is not a professional poet, but, in the first instance, a man of
          the world, in the second, that which his gifts forbade his being, namely, a poetical
          dilettante.</p>

        <p>Though he was incapable of being a dilettante in the calling in which he was determined
          to play that part (a determination which nowadays detracts from our respect for him), he
          was indisputably one in another field of activity, where it was by no means his intention,
          namely, in politics. Practical though he always showed himself to be when it came to
          political action, his politics were in reality–whether he took part in the conspiracies
          of the Carbonari at Ravenna or led the Suliotes at Missolonghi–the politics of the
          emotionalist and the adventurer. His first proceeding after he had resolved to go to
          Greece was to order for himself and his friends gilded helmets with his crest and motto
          engraved on them. The great politician of our days is the man who lays plans, adheres to
          them and develops them year after year, and, obstinate and regardless of side issues,
          carries them out in the end, without the heroic apparatus, but with the hero's
          determination.</p>

        <p>It must not be forgotten that a whole succession of Byron's admirers and imitators have
          forced themselves in between him and us, obscuring the figure, and confusing our
          impression, of the great departed. Their qualities have been imputed to him, and he has
          been blamed for their faults. <pb n="254"/> When the literary reaction set in against those who had
          understood him half and wrongly–against the brokenhearted, the <emph>blasés</emph>, the enigmatical,
          writers–his great name suffered along with theirs; it was swept aside along with the
          lesser ones. It had deserved better of fate.</p>

        <p>George Gordon Byron, born on the 22nd of January 1788, was the son of a passionate and
          unhappy mother, who a short time before his birth left her dissipated, brutal husband.
          This man, Captain Byron, who had served for a time in America as an officer in the Guards,
          was known in his youth as »mad Jack Byron.« He eloped to the Continent with the wife of
          the Marquis of Carmarthen, married her when her husband obtained a divorce from her, spent
          all her money, and treated her so badly that she died of grief a few years after her
          marriage. Captain Byron returned to England with his little daughter, Augusta, and, solely
          with the view of improving his circumstances, married a wealthy Scottish heiress, Miss
          Catherine Gordon of Gight, who became the mother of the man who still enjoys a world-wide
          fame. Immediately after the wedding Captain Byron began to make away with the fortune of
          his second wife. In the course of a year he had reduced it from £24,000 to £3000. She left
          him in France and, coming to London, gave birth there to her only child. By an accident,
          said to have occurred at the time of his birth, one of the child's feet was malformed.</p>

        <p>Two years later the mother went with her boy to Scotland, and took up her residence at
          Aberdeen. Captain Byron, during a pause in his dissipations, followed them there, in the
          hope of extracting more money from his wife. She generously gave him the shelter of her
          roof for a time, and afterwards they still continued to visit each other, until Captain
          Byron, to evade his creditors, was obliged to return to France, where he died in 1791.
          When the news of his death reached his wife, who had never ceased to love him, her grief
          bordered on distraction, and her shrieks were so loud as to be heard in the street.</p>

        <p>Uncontrollable passionateness, differing only in its manifestations and its force, was
          thus a characteristic <pb n="255"/> of both Byron's parents. And farther back in the families of both,
          we find the same temperament, revealing itself in the mother's family in attempts at
          suicide and poisoning, and in the father's, now in heroic daring, now in reckless excess.
          Byron's paternal grandfather, Admiral John Byron, generally known as »hardy Byron,« took
          part in the naval warfare against Spain and France, made voyages of discovery in the South
          Sea, circumnavigated the globe, and went through perils and adventures without number; the
          peculiarity that he could never take a voyage without encountering terrible storms gained
          him the nickname among the sailors of »foul-weather Jack.« Byron compares his own fate
          with his grandfather's. The family temperament shows itself in its worst form in the
          poet's grand-uncle, William, Lord Byron, a dissolute brawler, who achieved notoriety by
          killing his neighbour, Mr. Chaworth (after a quarrel), in a duel fought without seconds.
          It was only in his quality of peer of England that he escaped sentence for murder; ever
          after his trial he lived on his estate of Newstead, shunned like a leper. He was hated by
          all around him; his wife procured a separation from him; among the superstitious country
          people extravagantly horrible stories of his doings circulated and were believed.</p>

        <p>Thus the poet had wild blood in his veins. But it was also very aristocratic blood. On
          the mother's side he claimed descent from the Stuarts, from King James the First of
          Scotland; on his father's he was the descendant (though with a bar-sinister in the arms, a
          circumstance Byron himself never alludes to) of the Norman noble Ralph de Burun, who
          accompanied William the Conqueror into England. And when the grand-uncle just named lost,
          first his only son, and then, in 1794, his only grandson, it became probable that »the
          little lame boy who lives at Aberdeen,« as his uncle called him, would inherit both
          Newstead and the family title.</p>

        <p>It was with this prospect before him that the lame boy grew up. He was proud and
          uncontrollable by nature. When he was still in petticoats, his nurse reprimanding him
          angrily one day for having soiled a new frock, he got into <pb n="256"/> one of his »silent rages« (as
          he himself called them), turned as pale as a sheet, seized his frock with both hands, and
          tore it from top to bottom. His mother's treatment of him was little calculated to correct
          these tendencies. She alternately overwhelmed him with reproaches and with passionate
          caresses; when she was in a rage she vented on him the anger which his father's treatment
          of her aroused; she sometimes even reproached him with his lameness. The fault lies partly
          with her that this physical infirmity cast such a dark shadow over little George's mind;
          he heard his own mother call him »a lame brat.« Bandaging and various kinds of surgical
          treatment only increased the evil; the foot gave him much pain, and the proud little boy
          exercised all the strength of his will in concealing his suffering, and, as much as
          possible, his limp. Sometimes he was unable to bear any allusion to his deformity; at
          other times he would speak with a mocking bitterness of his »club-foot.«</p>

        <p>Though Byron was not diligent at school, he developed a passion, the moment he could
          read, for history and books of travel; the seeds of his longing for the East were sown in
          his earliest youth. He himself tells that before he was ten he had read six long works on
          Turkey, besides other books of travel and adventure, and Arabian tales. As a little boy
          his favourite story was <emph>Zeluco</emph>, by John Moore, the hero of which is a youth whose
          mother's bad education of him after his father's death has led to his giving way to all
          his own caprices; he becomes »as inflammable as gunpowder.« In this hero of romance, who
          reminds us of William Lovell, the boy saw himself reflected. One of the qualities which
          were to play a decisive part in the poet's life revealed itself very early, namely, his
          passionate attraction towards the other sex. At the age of five he was so deeply in love
          with a little girl, Mary Duff, that when, eleven years afterwards, he heard of her
          marriage, his feelings nearly threw him into convulsions.</p>

        <p>With pride, passionateness, melancholy, and a fantastic longing for travel, there was
          combined, as the determining quality of his character, an ardent love of truth. Naïve
          sincerity distinguished the child who was destined as a man <pb n="257"/> to be the great antagonist of
          the hypocrisies of European society. His defiant spirit was only one of the forms of his
          truthfulness. His nurse took him one night to the theatre to see <emph>The Taming of the
          Shrew</emph>. In the scene between Catherine and Petruchio, where Petruchio insists that what
          Catherine knows to be the moon is the sun, little Geordie (as they called the child)
          started from his seat and cried out boldly: »But I say it is the moon, sir.«</p>

        <p>When George was ten, his grand-uncle, Lord Byron, died. One of the child's first actions
          after being told what had happened, was to run to his mother and ask if she noticed any
          difference in him since he had become a lord. On the morning when his name was first
          called out in school with the title of »Dominus« prefixed to it, he was so much agitated
          that he was unable to give utterance to the usual answer, »Adsum«; after standing silent
          for a moment he burst into tears. Byron's intensest pleasures were at first, and for long,
          those of gratified vanity. But to understand his agitation properly in this case, one must
          remember what the title of »lord« implied, and still implies, in England. The nobility
          proper of that country consists of not more than about four hundred titled persons–about
          the number of princes in Germany. On their own estates these noblemen exercise an almost
          unlimited political and social influence; their position is not much inferior to that of
          reigning princes, and, as a rule, their wealth corresponds to their rank. Such, however,
          was not the case in this instance; Byron had no private fortune, and the property of
          Newstead Abbey was in a neglected condition, and heavily mortgaged.</p>

        <p>In the autumn of 1798 Mrs. Byron took her little son to Newstead. When they came to
          Newstead toll-bar, affecting to be ignorant of the neighbourhood, she asked the woman of
          the toll-house, to whom the park and mansion they saw before them belonged. She was told
          that the owner of it had been some months dead. »And who is the next heir?« asked the
          proud and happy mother. »They say,« answered the woman, »it is a little boy who lives in
          Aberdeen.« »And this is he, bless him!« exclaimed the <pb n="258"/> nurse, no longer able to contain
          herself, and turning to kiss with delight the young lord, who was seated on her lap.</p>

        <p>In 1801 the boy was sent to Harrow, one of the great English public schools which is much
          in favour with the aristocracy. The system of instruction (strictly classical) was
          uninteresting and pedantic, and did not produce much effect on Byron, whose relations with
          his masters were as strained as his friendships with his comrades were enthusiastic. »My
          school friendships,« he writes in his diary in 1821, »were with <emph>me passions</emph> (for I was
          always violent).« As a friend he was generous, and loved to play the part of protector.
          When Peel, the future Prime Minister, was one day being unmercifully thrashed by the elder
          boy whose fag he was, Byron interrupted, and, knowing he was not strong enough to fight
          the tyrant, humbly begged to be allowed to take half the stripes the latter meant to
          inflict. When little Lord Gort, after having had his hand burned with a piece of red-hot
          iron by one of the monitors, as a punishment for making bad toast, refused, when the
          matter was investigated into, to tell the name of the culprit, Byron offered to take him
          as his fag, promising that he should not be ill-used. »I became his fag,« said Lord Gort
          (see Countess Guiccioli's <emph>Reminiscences</emph>), »and was perfectly delighted when I found what
          a good, kind master I had, one who was always giving me cakes and sweets, and was most
          lenient with my faults.« To his favourite fag, the Duke of Dorset, Byron, in his <emph>Hours of
          Idleness</emph>, addressed some charming lines in memory of their school days.</p>

        <p>When the boy was at home in the holidays, his mothers behaviour towards him was as
          erratic, her temper as uncontrollable, as ever; but now, instead of being afraid of her,
          he could not resist laughing at the fat little woman's outbreaks. Not content with
          smashing cups and plates, she sometimes employed poker and tongs as missiles.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">
            
            The relation between mother and son has been so accurately and vividly described by
              Disraeli in his novel <emph>Venetia</emph>, that I append a scene from the book in question,–merely
              condensing it, and substituting the real names for the fictitious (Cadurcis, Plantagenet,
              Morpeth, &amp;c). The scene takes place one morning at Annesley, a country house in the
              neighbourhood of Newstead. A post-chaise drives up to the hall, and from it issues a
              short, stout woman with a rubicund countenance, dressed in a style which remarkably blends
              the shabby with the tawdry. She is accompanied by a boy between eleven and twelve years of
              age, whose appearance is in strong contrast with his mother's, for he is pale and slender,
              with long curling black hair and black eyes, which occasionally, by their transient
              flashes, agreeably relieve a face, the general expression of which might be esteemed
              somewhat shy and sullen. It is a first visit. The visitors enter tired and hot.
            
            <p>»'A terrible journey,' exclaimed Mrs. Byron, fanning herself as she took her seat, 'and
              so very hot! George, my love, make your bow! Have not I always told you to make a bow when
              you enter the room, especially where there are strangers? Make your bow to Mrs.
              Chaworth.'</p>
            
            <p>The boy gave a sort of sulky nod, but Mrs. Chaworth received it so graciously and
              expressed herself so kindly to him that his features relaxed a little, though he was quite
              silent and sat on the edge of his chair, the picture of dogged indifference.</p>
            
            <p>'Charming country, Mrs. Chaworth,' said Mrs. Byron.... 'Annesley is a delightful place,
              very unlike the Abbey. Dreadfully lonesome, I assure you, I find it there. Great change
              for us from a little town and all our kind neighbours. Very different from Dulwich; is it
              not, George?'</p>
            
            <p>'I hate Dulwich,' said the boy.</p>
            
            <p>'Hate Dulwich!' exclaimed Mrs. Byron; 'well, I am sure, that is very ungrateful, with so
              many kind friends as we always found. Besides, George, have I not always told you that you
              are to hate nothing? It is very wicked.–The trouble it costs me, Mrs. Chaworth, to
              educate this dear child!' continued Mrs. Byron turning to her hostess. 'But when he likes,
              he can be as good as any one. Can't you, George?'</p>
            
            <p>Lord Byron gave a grim smile, seated himself at the very back of the deep chair and swung
              his feet, which no longer reached the ground, to and fro. 'I am sure that Lord Byron
              always behaves well,' said Mrs. Chaworth.</p>
            
            <p>'There, George,' continued Mrs. Byron, 'only listen to that. Hear what Mrs. Chaworth
              says. Now mind, never give her cause to change her opinion.</p>
            
            <p>George curled his lip, and half turned his back on his companions....</p>
            
            <p>'George, my dear, speak. Have not I always told you, when you pay a visit, that you
              should open your mouth now and then. I don't like chattering children, but I like them to
              answer when they are spoken to.'</p>
            
            <p>'Nobody has spoken to me,' said Lord Byron in a sullen tone.</p>
            
            <p>'George, my love,' said his mother in a solemn voice, 'you know you promised me to be
              good.'</p>
            
            <p>'Well! what have I done?'</p>
            
            <p>'Lord Byron,' said Mrs. Chaworth, interfering, 'do you like to look at pictures?'</p>
            
            <p>'Thank you,' replied the little lord in a more courteous tone; 'I like to be left
              alone.'</p>
            
            <p>'Did you ever know such an odd child!' said Mrs. Byron; 'and yet, I assure you, Mrs.
              Chaworth, he can behave, when he likes, as pretty as possible.'</p>
            
            <p>'Pretty!' muttered the little lord between his teeth.</p>
            
            <p>'If you had only seen him at Dulwich sometimes at a little tea-party,' said Mrs. Byron,
              'he really was quite the ornament of the company.'</p>
            
            <p>'No, I wasn't,' said Lord Byron.</p>
            
            <p>'George!' said his mother again in a solemn tone, 'have I not always told you that you
              are never to contradict any one?'</p>
            
            <p>The little lord indulged in a suppressed growl.</p>
            
            <p>'There was a little play last Christmas,' continued Mrs. Byron, 'and he acted quite
              delightfully. Now you would not think that, from the way he sits upon that chair. George,
              my dear, I do insist upon your behaving yourself. Sit like a man.'</p>
            
            <p>'I am not a man,' said Lord Byron, very quietly; 'I wish I were.'</p>
            
            <p>'George!' said the mother, 'have I not always told you that you are never to answer me?
              It is not proper for children to answer.... Do you hear me?' she cried, with a face
              reddening to scarlet, and almost menacing a move from her seat.</p>
            
            <p>'Yes, everybody hears you, Mrs. Byron,' said the little lord.</p>
            
            <p>'Don't call me Mrs. Byron; that is not the way to speak to your mother; I will not be
              called Mrs. Byron by you.... I have half a mind to get up and give you a good shake, that
              I have. O Mrs. Chaworth,' sighed Mrs. Byron, while a tear trickled down her cheek, 'if you
              only knew the life I lead, and what trouble it costs me to educate that child!'</p>
            
            <p>'My dear madam,' said Mrs. Chaworth, 'I am sure that Lord Byron has no other wish but to
              please you. Indeed you have misunderstood him.'</p>
            
            <p>'Yes! she always misunderstands me,' said Lord Byron in a softer tone, but with pouting
              lips and suffused eyes.</p>
            
            <p>'Now he is going on,' said his mother, beginning herself to cry dreadfully ... and,
              irritated by the remembrance of all his naughtiness, she rushed forward to give him what
              she had threatened, and what she in general ultimately had recourse to, a good shake.</p>
            
            <p>Her agile son, experienced in these storms, escaped in time, and pushed his chair before
              his infuriated mother; Mrs. Byron, however, rallied, and chased him round the room; in her
              despair she took up a book and threw it at his head; he laughed a fiendish laugh, as,
              ducking his head, the book flew on and dashed through a pane of glass. Mrs. Byron made a
              desperate charge, and her son, a little frightened at her almost maniacal passion, saved
              himself by suddenly seizing Mrs. Chaworth's work-table and whisking it before her. She
              fell over the leg of the table, and went into hysterics, while Lord Byron, pale and
              dogged, stood in a corner.«</p>
            
            
          </note></p>

        <p><pb n="259"/> Let us imagine, after such a scene as that described in the note, a smiling,
          golden-haired girl entering the room and softening the defiant boy's mood with a look, and
          we have a situation such as cannot have been at all uncommon at Annesley, the residence of
          the Chaworth family (relations of the man whom Byron's grand-uncle <pb n="260"/> killed in the notorious
          duel), when Mrs. Byron and her son were visiting there. The golden-haired girl, Mary Anne
          Chaworth, was seventeen when Byron was fifteen. He loved her passionately and jealously.
          At balls, where she was in great request as a partner, and his lameness prevented his
          dancing, it occasioned him agonies to see her <pb n="261"/> in the arms of other men. The climax was put
          to his sufferings when he overheard her one evening saying to her maid: »Do you think I
          could care anything for that lame boy?« He darted out of the house, late though it was,
          and, scarcely knowing where he was running, never stopped till he came to Newstead.
          Thirteen years later, in the Villa Deodati, by the Lake of Geneva, he wrote, with the
          tears streaming from his eyes, a poem, <emph>The Dream</emph>, which treats of this attachment, and
          shows the deep impression made by the early disappointment.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Very characteristic of Mrs. Byron is the manner in which she communicated to her son
            (two years after he had been obliged to give up all hope) the news of Mary Chaworth's
            marriage. A visitor who was present tells the story:–»'Byron,' she said, 'I have some
            news for you.' Well, what is it?' 'Take out your handkerchief first, for you will want
            it.' He did so, to humour her. 'Miss Chaworth is married.' An expression very peculiar,
            impossible to describe, passed over his pale face, and he hurried his handkerchief into
            his pocket, saying, with an affected air of coldness and nonchalance, 'Is that all?' 'Why,
            I expected you would have been plunged in grief!' He made no reply, and soon began to talk
            about something else.« The less he could confide in his mother, the more impelled he felt
            to express his feelings and sorrows on paper.</note></p>

        <p>The cleverer Byron became in preserving a sarcastically calm attitude during his mother's
          fits of rage, the more unnatural became the relations between mother and son. The scenes
          were sometimes terrible. It is told as a curious example of their idea of each other's
          violence, that, after parting one evening, each went privately later in the night to the
          apothecary's to inquire whether the other had been to purchase poison, and to caution the
          man not to attend to such an application, if made. In his letters young Byron writes with
          melancholy humour of the manner in which he is every now and then driven to take flight,
          to escape from scenes at home. He gives not the slightest hint to any one of the intended
          excursions, for fear, he says, of rousing »the accustomed maternal war whoop.«</p>

        <p>In 1805 Byron went to Cambridge, where he spent his time less in study than in the
          practice of all the varieties of athletic exercise to which from his childhood he had
          eagerly devoted himself, in the hope of atoning by his proficiency in them for his bodily
          infirmity. Riding, swimming, driving, shooting, boxing, cricket-playing, and drinking,
          were accom<pb n="262"/>plishments in which he was determined to excel. He began to develop the signs of
          a dandy; and it satisfied his youthful love of bravado to take excursions in company with
          a pretty young girl, who went about with him in male attire, and played the part of his
          valet, or sometimes of his younger brother–in which character he was impertinent enough
          to introduce her to a lady at Brighton who was unacquainted with his family.</p>

        <p>Newstead Abbey had been let for a term of years. As soon as it was vacant, Byron went to
          live there. It is a real old Gothic abbey, with refectory and cells, the earliest parts of
          it dating from 1170. The house and gardens are surrounded by a battlemented wall. In the
          courtyard is a Gothic well. In front is a park, with a large lake. At Newstead, Byron and
          his friends, in their youthful, defiant antipathy to all rules, led a life of dissipation
          which showed traces of the mania for originality to which, as history shows, men of genius
          have not unfrequently been subject before becoming conscious of their proper tasks and
          aims. These young men got up at 2 P.M. and fenced, played shuttlecock, or practised with
          pistols in the hall; after dinner, to the scandal of the pious inhabitants of the
          neighbourhood, a human skull filled with Burgundy went round. It was the skull of some old
          monk, which the gardener had unearthed when digging; Byron, in a capricious mood, had had
          it mounted in silver as a drinking-cup, and he and his companions took a childish pleasure
          in using it as such, themselves dressed up as monks, with all the proper apparatus of
          crosses, beads, tonsures, &amp;C.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">The present owner of Newstead has, from religious reasons, had it buried.</note> It is a mistake, however, to regard the action simply
          as an evidence of that want of feeling which so often–among medical students, for
          instance–accompanies joviality; to a man like Byron the sight of this <emph>memento mori</emph> in
          the midst of his carousals probably acted as a kind of bitter stimulant. In the lines
          which he addressed to it he writes that, to the dead man, the touch of human lips must be
          preferable to the bite of the worm.</p>

        <p>Byron's excesses did not proceed from too high spirits. <pb n="263"/> He was oppressed, not only by the
          melancholy which attacks most youths of remarkable ability when they find themselves, with
          their untried powers, face to face with nothing but questions, but, in addition to this,
          by the melancholy which was a result of his passionate character and his upbringing. Two
          stories, which to most of his biographers seem very pathetic, are told of him at this
          period of his life. The first is in connection with his dog, Boatswain. In 1808, he
          composed an excessively misanthropic inscription for this favourite's grave, in which he
          lauds him at the expense of the whole human race; and at the same time he made a will
          (afterwards cancelled), in which he desired that he should be buried beside his dog, his
          only friend. The other proof of his forlorn mood is the manner in which he spent his
          twenty-first birthday, the day of his coming of age, an occasion which is celebrated among
          the English nobility with all manner of festivities–illuminations, fireworks, a ball, and
          the entertainment of all the tenants. Byron was so poor that he was obliged to have
          recourse to the money-lenders for the wherewithal to give his tenants a ball and roast the
          customary ox for them. But no long train of carriages bringing visitors of high degree
          drew up at the doors of Newstead Abbey on the 22nd of January 1809; neither mother,
          sister, guardians, nor relations, near or distant, were there. Byron himself spent the day
          at a hotel in London. In a letter of the year 1822 he writes: »Did I ever tell you that
          the day I came of age I dined on eggs and bacon and a bottle of ale? For once in a way
          they are my favourite dish and drinkable; but as neither of them agree with me, I never
          use them but on great jubilees–once in four or five years or so.«</p>

        <p>It is, naturally, pleasanter to be rich than to be poor, and more flattering to one's
          self-esteem to receive the congratulations of relatives and friends than to feel one's
          self homeless and solitary; but in comparison with the difficulties and privations and
          humiliations which every young modern plebeian has to encounter at the outset of his
          career, the adversities of this young patrician dwindle into nothing. What gave them their
          importance was that <pb n="264"/> they early drove Byron, who, as a young aristocrat, might otherwise
          have been absorbed by the pursuits and ideas of his class and kin, exclusively to those
          resources which he possessed as the single, isolated individual.</p>

        <p>It was not one of the great political events of the day, no transport of joy or anger
          occasioned by the great political revolutions in which the period was so fertile, that
          tore Byron away from the disorderly, aimless life at Newstead. Such events as the death of
          Fox, or that proceeding which redounded so little to the honour of England–the
          bombardment of Copenhagen, made no impression whatever on the youth who, as a man, was to
          be so strongly affected by every historical occurrence, every political deed or misdeed.
          It was a private literary contrariety which made the first turning-point in his life.
          Whilst living (from the summer of 1806 till the summer of 1807) in the little town of
          Southwell, Byron had produced his first attempts at poetry, which had met with much
          appreciation from the younger members of a family named Pigot, who were his intimates at
          the time. In March 1807 a collection of these poems was published under the title, <emph>Hours
          of Idleness</emph>. The volume contained nothing very remarkable; the poems which really testify
          to strength of feeling are swamped by quantities of school-boy verses, some of them
          translations and imitations of the school classics and <emph>Ossian</emph>, the rest, sentimental
          poems of love and friendship, immature in conception and style. In one or two, we readers
          of the present day, wise after the event, can plainly detect Byron's future personality
          and style. In the poem <emph>To a Lady</emph>, which is addressed to Mary Chaworth, occur two
          genuinely Byronic verses:–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»If thou wert mine, had all been hush'd:–</l>
          <l>This cheek now pale from early riot,</l>
          <l>With passion's hectic ne'er had flush'd,</l>
          <l>But bloomed in calm domestic quiet.</l>
          <l>…</l>
          <l>But now I seek for other joys:</l>
          <l>To think would drive my soul to madness;</l>
          <l>In thoughtless throngs and empty noise,</l>
          <l>I conquer half my bosom's sadness.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p><pb n="265"/> The poems were really of little value, and the ample provision of childish, foolish
          notes, the pretentious preface, and the appendage of the words »A Minor« to the author's
          name on the title-page, lent themselves to ridicule.</p>

        <p>In January 1808, the <emph>Edinburgh Review</emph>, at that time the highest literary court of
          appeal, contained an extremely sarcastic review of the volume, probably written by Lord
          Brougham. »The noble author,« writes the reviewer, »is peculiarly forward in pleading
          minority; we have it in the title-page, and on the very back of the volume.... If any suit
          could be brought against Lord Byron, for the purpose of compelling him to put into court a
          certain quantity of poetry, and if judgment were given against him, it is highly probable
          that an exception would be taken, were he to deliver <emph>for poetry</emph> the contents of this
          volume. To this he might plead <emph>minority</emph>; but, &amp;c. &amp;c.... Perhaps however, in
          reality all that he tells us about his youth is rather with a view to increase our wonder
          than to soften our censures. He possibly means to say, 'See how a minor can write! This
          poem was actually composed by a young man of eighteen, and this by one of only sixteen!'
          ... So far from hearing, with any degree of surprise, that very poor verses were written
          by a youth from his leaving school to his leaving college, inclusive, we really believe
          that it happens in the life of nine men in ten who are educated in England, and that the
          tenth man writes better verse than Lord Byron.... We must beg leave seriously to assure
          him that the mere rhyming of the final syllable, even when accompanied by the presence of
          a certain number of feet–nay, although (which does not always happen) those feet should
          scan regularly, and have been all counted accurately upon the fingers–is not the whole
          art of poetry. A certain portion of liveliness, somewhat of fancy, is necessary to
          constitute a poem ... &amp;c. &amp;c.«</p>

        <p>The reviewer's advice to Byron is to give up poetry and employ his gifts and his leisure
          hours better. As an exhortation addressed to the epoch-making English poet of the age by
          one whose profession it was to assay and value the works of literary aspirants, the
          article, in spite of its partial <pb n="266"/> justification, was undeniably a gross blunder. But as far
          as Byron himself was concerned, nothing better could have happened to him. It affected him
          like a challenge; it was a terrible blow to his vanity, and roused that which was to
          survive him–his pride. A friend who saw him in the first moments of excitement after
          reading the article, has described the fierce defiance of his looks, and added that it
          would be difficult for sculptor or painter to imagine a subject of more fearful beauty
          than the young poet in his wrath.</p>

        <p>Byron concealed his feelings from every one. In a letter written about this time he
          expresses regret that his mother has taken the affair so much to heart, and assures his
          correspondent that his own repose and appetite have not been discomposed–that these
          »paper bullets of the brain« have only taught him to stand fire. But a dozen years
          afterwards he writes: »I well recollect the effect which the critique of the Edinburgh
          Reviewers on my first poem had upon me–it was rage and resistance, and redress; but not
          despondency nor despair. A savage review is hemlock to a sucking author, and the one on me
          knocked me down–but I got up again ... bent on falsifying their raven predictions, and
          determined to show them, croak as they would, that it was not the last time they should
          hear from me.« Thus came the stimulus from the outside world which for the first time
          drove all the young man's passionate, scattered emotions into one channel, and made of
          them one feeling, one aim. With obstinate determination he set to work; he slept during
          the day, rising after sunset in order to be less disturbed, and for several months worked
          every night and all night long at his first famous satire.</p>

        <head><pb n="[267]"/> XVIII. BYRON: THE PASSIONATE PERSONALITY–(<emph>Continued</emph>)</head>

        <p>Famous it is, and famous it deserved to become, though not because of its wit and humour,
          for it has neither the one nor the other–nor yet because of its effectiveness, for it is
          satire which for the most part hacks and hews blindly, here, there, and everywhere–but
          because of the power, the self-consciousness, the unexampled audacity, which underlie and
          which found expression in the whole. The attacks of the reviewers had produced in Byron
          for the first time the feeling which was soon to become constant and dominant in his
          breast, the feeling which first made him completely conscious of himself, and which may be
          expressed in the words: »Alone against you all!« To him, as to the other great combative
          characters of history, this feeling was the elixir of life. »Jeer at <emph>me</emph> with impunity!
          Crush <emph>me</emph>, who am stronger than all of them together!« was the refrain that rang in his
          ears whilst he wrote. The Edinburgh Reviewers were accustomed, when they crushed a
          trumpery little poet and flung him on the ground like a fly, or by mischance shot a poor
          little song-bird, to no resistance on the part of the victim. He either rebelled against
          the verdict in silence, or humbly laid the blame on his own want of ability. In either
          case what followed was profound silence. But now they had lighted upon the man whose
          prodigious strength and weakness lay exactly in the peculiarity that he never blamed
          himself for a misfortune, but furiously turned upon others as its authors. In this case,
          too, a silence of a year and a half followed upon the review. But then happened what we
          read of in Victor Hugo's poem (<emph>Les Châtiments</emph>. »La Caravane«):</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Tout à coup, au milieu de ce silence morne</l>
          <l>Qui monte et qui s'accroît de moment en moment,</l>
          <l>S'élève un formidable et long rugissement!</l>
          <l>C'est le lion.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p><pb n="268"/> And the image is the correct one. For this satire, with its deficiency in beauty, grace,
          and wit, is more a roar than a song. The poet who has the throat of the nightingale,
          rejoices when he for the first time hears that his own voice is melodious; the ugly
          duckling becomes happily conscious of its swan-nature when it is cast into its own
          element; but the roar which tells him that now he is grown up, that now he is a lion,
          startles the young lion himself. It is in vain, therefore, to look in <emph>English Bards and
          Scotch Reviewers</emph> for sword-thrusts, given with a steady hand and sure aim; these wounds
          are not the work of a hand; they are torn with a claw–but the claw is the claw of a lion.
          It is in vain to search for criticism, moderation, reason; does the wounded beast of prey
          display discernment and tact when a bullet, intended to kill it, has only slightly wounded
          it? No; its own blood, which it sees flowing, dims its eyes, and it desires nothing but to
          shed blood in revenge. It does not even seek the firer of the shot alone; if one of the
          troop has wounded the young lion, then woe to the troop! All the literary celebrities of
          England, even the greatest and most popular–all who were in favour with the <emph>Edinburgh
          Review</emph> and all who wrote in it–are in this satire treated like schoolboys by a youth of
          twenty, scarcely more than a schoolboy himself. They run the gauntlet one after the other,
          English poets and Scotch reviewers. There is many a hard hit that does not miss its mark.
          The empty fantasticalness of Southey's <emph>Thalaba</emph>, and its author's abnormal productivity;
          the proofs afforded by Wordsworth's own poems of the truth of his doctrine that verse is
          the same as prose; Coleridge's childish naïveté; Moore's licentiousness–all these receive
          their due share of attention. An attack is made on Scott's <emph>Marmion</emph> which reminds us of
          the jeers of Aristophanes at the heroes of Euripides. But by far the greater proportion of
          the attacks made, are so rash and graceless that they became the occasion of much more
          annoyance to their author than to the persons attacked. Byron's guardian, Lord Carlisle,
          to whom he had but lately dedicated <emph>Hours of Idleness</emph>, but who had declined to introduce
          him to the House of Lords; and men like Scott, Moore, <pb n="269"/> and Lord Holland, who at a later
          period were among the poet's best friends, were here abused on perfectly incorrect
          premises, and with a want of judgment which is paralleled only by the astonishing alacrity
          with which Byron, as soon as he was convinced that he had been in the wrong, apologised
          and strove to efface the impression of his errors. Some years later he tried in vain to
          put an end to the existence of the satire by destroying the whole fifth edition.</p>

        <p>In the meantime it created a great sensation, and produced the desired effect, the
          rehabilitation of its author.</p>

        <p>In the beginning of 1809 Byron had gone to live in London, partly to superintend the
          publication of his satire, partly for the purpose of taking his seat in the House of
          Lords. As he had no friend among the peers to introduce him, he was obliged, contrary to
          custom, to present himself alone. His friend, Mr. Dallas, has described the scene. When
          Byron entered the House he was even paler than usual, and his countenance betrayed
          mortification and indignation. The Chancellor, Lord Eldon, put out his hand warmly to
          welcome him, and paid him some compliment. But this was thrown away upon Lord Byron, who
          made a stiff bow, and put the tips of his fingers into the Chancellor's hands. The
          Chancellor did not press a welcome so received, but resumed his seat. Byron carelessly
          seated himself on one of the empty Opposition benches, remained there for a few minutes to
          indicate to which party he belonged, and then left. »I have taken my seat,« he said to
          Dallas, »and now I will go abroad.«</p>

        <p>He left England in June 1809. He had, as he wrote to his mother in 1808, long felt, that
          »if we see no nation but our own, we do not give mankind a fair chance–it is from
          <emph>experience</emph>, not books, we ought to judge of them. There is nothing like inspection, and
          trusting to our own senses.« He now went first to Lisbon (see the poem <emph>Huzza! Hodgson!</emph>)
          The description of Cintra in the First Canto of <emph>Childe Harold</emph> is a recollection of the
          impressions received during his short stay in Portugal. From Lisbon he and his friend
          Hobhouse travelled on horseback to Seville and Cadiz, and thence to Gibraltar by sea.</p>

        <p><pb n="270"/> None of the magnificent historical monuments of Seville made any impression on Byron, but
          both there and at Cadiz he was deeply interested in the women. The advances made by
          various beautiful Spanish ladies flattered the young man, who took with him as a
          remembrance from Seville a lock of hair about three feet in length. Gibraltar, being an
          English town, is, of course, a »cursed place.«</p>

        <p>But, though little impressed by the historical memories of the countries he is visiting,
          he is already beginning to interest himself in their political relations. Those of Spain
          with England occupy him first. The first two cantos of <emph>Childe Harold</emph> show that he felt
          nothing but contempt for the foreign policy of England. He jeers at what the English
          called their victory of Talavera, where they lost 5000 men without doing the French much
          harm; and he is audacious enough to call Napoleon his hero.</p>

        <p>From Spain Byron went to Malta. Its memories of the days of yore, which so delighted old
          Sir Walter Scott, made no more impression on the young nobleman than those of Seville had
          done. He was as entirely devoid of the romantic historical sense as of romantic national
          feeling. What he thought of, and longed for, were not the green pastures of England, or
          the misty hills of Scotland, but the Lake of Geneva in all its glory of colour, and the
          bright Ægean Sea. His mind did not dwell on the historical exploits of his countrymen, on
          wars like the War of the Roses; it was occupied with the politics of the day; and in the
          past nothing interested him but the great struggles for liberty. To him the old statues
          were only stone; the living women were more beautiful in his eyes than the ancient
          goddesses (»than all the nonsense of their stone ideal,« as he puts it in <emph>Don Juan</emph>); but
          on the field of Marathon he fell into a deep reverie, and he celebrates its memories in
          both his long narrative poems. When, during the last year of his life, he visited Ithaca,
          he rejected all offers to show him the remains of antiquity on the island, remarking to
          Trelawny: »I detest antiquarian twaddle. Do people think I have no lucid intervals, that I
          came to Greece to scribble more nonsense?« The poetic enthusiasm for liberty was in the
          end swallowed <pb n="271"/> up by the practical. With Byron Romantic sentimentality comes to an end;
          with him the modern spirit in poetry originates; therefore it was that he influenced not
          only his own country but Europe.</p>

        <p>At Malta he was greatly captivated by a beautiful young lady, a Mrs. Spencer Smith, who
          for political reasons was subjected to persecution by Napoleon. An enthusiastic friendship
          sprang up between the two, which is commemorated in several of Byron's poems. (<emph>Childe
          Harold</emph>, ii. 30. <emph>To Florence. Lines Written in an Album, Stanzas composed during a
          Thunderstorm. Stanzas Written in Passing the Ambracian Gulf</emph>.) From Malta the travellers
          went by way of Western Greece to Albania, the »rugged nurse of savage men,« as Byron in
          <emph>Childe Harold</emph> calls the country,</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>

        <p>It is characteristic of him, that in his first travels he visited regions which lay
          practically without the pale of civilisation, countries where the personality of the
          inhabitant was almost entirely untrammelled by convention. Natural affinity attracted him
          to these scenes and these beings. Like the young man in Wordsworth's <emph>Ruth</emph>,</p>

          </note> The <pb n="272"/> Albanians were at that time almost as savage as their
          Pelasgian ancestors. Their law was the law of the sword, the vendetta their idea of
          justice. The people of the country, as Byron first beheld them assembled, the setting sun
          illuminating their magnificent dresses and the rich trappings of their horses, whilst
          drums beat and the muezzins called the hour from the minaret of the mosque, presented such
          a spectacle as we read of in the <emph>Thousand and One Nights</emph>.</p>

        <p>Janina proved to be a more important town than Athens. It was on their journey to or from
          Janina that the travellers were deserted by their guide. In their perilous condition among
          these wild mountains, with the prospect before them of dying of hunger, Byron was the
          member of the party who kept up the spirits of all the others by that dauntlessness which
          distinguished him in all dangerous situations.</p>

        <p>The day after their arrival in the capital, Byron was introduced to Ali Pacha, »the
          Turkish Bonaparte,« whom he had always admired in spite of his savage cruelty. Ali
          received his visitor standing, was extremely friendly, desired his respects to Byron's
          mother, and flattered Byron himself very agreeably by telling him that he knew him at once
          to be a man of noble birth by his small ears, curling hair, and little white hands. The
          visit to Ali provided matter for some of the principal scenes in the <emph>Fourth Canto</emph> of Don
          Juan. Lambro and several other Byronic figures are drawn from him. (He is also described
          by Victor Hugo in <emph>Les Orientales</emph>.) Ali treated Byron like a spoiled child, sending him
          almonds and sugared sherbet, fruit and sweetmeats, twenty times a day.</p>

        <p>Protected by a guard of fifty men given him by Ali from the numerous troops of brigands
          which infested the country, Byron now travelled all through Albania. His wild followers
          became so attached to him that, when he had an attack of fever, they threatened to kill
          the doctor if the patient were not cured. The doctor ran away–and the patient recovered.
          It was in the course of this tour, before retiring to rest for the night in a cave by the
          shore of the Gulf of Arta, that Byron saw the scene (the Pyrrhic war-dance to the
          accompaniment of song) which he afterwards described <pb n="273"/> in <emph>Childe Harold</emph>, ii. 71, 72, and
          which inspired the beautiful song, »Tambourgi, Tambourgi!«</p>

        <p>During his stay in Athens, the indignation he felt at the plundering of the Parthenon by
          England, in the person of Lord Elgin, inspired him with the poem, <emph>The Curse of Minerva</emph>;
          and a transient attachment to one of the daughters of the English consul produced the
          song, <emph>Maid of Athens</emph>, the heroine of which, even after she had become a little pale old
          lady, continued to be tormented with visits from English tourists. On the 3rd of May,
          Byron performed his famous feat of swimming across the Dardanelles, from Sestos to Abydos,
          in an hour and ten minutes; he writes of it in <emph>Don Juan</emph>, and was proud of it all his
          life.</p>

        <p>All that he saw and did on this tour was, a few years later, to provide him with poetic
          material. In Constantinople he one day saw the street dogs devouring the flesh of a
          corpse; on this real scene are based the descriptions of horrors in <emph>The Siege of Corinth</emph>
          and in the Eighth Canto of <emph>Don Juan</emph> (assault of Ismail). After his return to Athens from
          a tour in the Morea, he would seem himself to have been concerned in the love affair on
          which <emph>The Giaour</emph> is based. (See the Marquis of Sligo's letter to Byron.) What we know
          for certain is, that one day, as he was returning from bathing at the Piræus, he met a
          detachment of Turkish soldiers carrying, sewn up in a sack, a young girl, who was to be
          thrown into the sea because she had accepted a Christian as her lover. Pistol in hand,
          Byron compelled the savage troop to turn back, and partly by bribery, partly by threats,
          procured the girl's release.</p>

        <p>This life of travel and adventure did not produce the mental equilibrium which Byron
          lacked. His last letters from abroad reveal settled melancholy. The disgust with life
          which is the result of aimlessness seems to weigh him to the earth. And he feels that he
          is coming home deep in debt, »with a body shaken by one or two smart fevers,« and to a
          country where he has no friends. He expects to be met only by creditors. What did meet him
          was the news of his mother's dangerous illness. He hastened to Newstead to see her once
          more, but she had died the day before he <pb n="274"/> arrived. Her maid found him in the evening
          sitting beside the corpse. She had heard his sobs through the closed door. On her begging
          him to try to control his grief, he burst into tears, and exclaimed: »Oh, Mrs. By, I had
          but one friend in the world, and she is gone!« Nevertheless, his excessive dislike to his
          grief being witnessed by others, was sufficient to prevent his following his mother's
          remains to the grave. He stood at the Abbey door till the funeral procession had moved
          off; then, turning to his attendant, young Rushton, desired him to fetch the
          sparring-gloves, and proceeded to his usual exercise with the boy. At last, the struggle
          to keep up seeming too much for him, he flung away the gloves and retired to his room.
          During the protracted fit of melancholy into which he sank, he made a will, in which he
          again ordered that he should be buried beside his dog.</p>

        <p>Byron had hardly landed before his friend Dallas asked him if he had brought any poetry
          back with him from his travels. The young poet, who was tolerably destitute of the
          critical sense, produced, not without pride, <emph>Hints from Horace</emph>, a new satire in Pope's
          style. With this work Mr. Dallas was very justifiably disappointed. On returning it next
          morning he asked if his friend had written nothing else, on which Byron handed him some
          short poems, and what he called »a number of stanzas in Spenser's measure« chiefly
          descriptive of the countries he had visited. These last were the first two cantos of
          <emph>Childe Harold</emph>; and at the urgent request of Dallas they were at once given to the
          printer.</p>

        <p>In the mind of the reader of to-day, the impression produced by these two cantos is apt
          to be mixed up with that produced by the last two (written six or seven years later); but
          whoever desires to understand Byron's development must be careful to keep the two
          impressions perfectly distinct from each other. The gap between the first and the second
          half of <emph>Childe Harold</emph> is as wide as the gap between this same second half and <emph>Don
          Juan</emph>.</p>

        <p>The stanzas which Byron showed Dallas are melodious, sincere in feeling, and occasionally
          grand; they were the first of the full, harmonious strains which were henceforward <pb n="275"/> to
          issue from the lips of this poet as long as he breathed the breath of life. But they only
          faintly forecast what the man was to be, with whose fame, ten years later, the continent
          of Europe rang. As yet, powerful descriptions of nature form the main ingredient in his
          poetry; the lyric outbursts are few and far between; to the casual reader these stanzas
          would seem simply to convey a world-weary young English aristocrat's impressions of
          travel, ennobled by the stateliness of the style–for the tone of <emph>Childe Harold</emph> is as
          idealistic and serious as that of <emph>Don Juan</emph> is realistic and humorous.</p>

        <p>The mood is one of monotonous melancholy. Byron is not yet the poet who bounds from one
          feeling to another, by preference its exact opposite, in order to make each as strong as
          possible, and then hacks and hews at them–the harder, the extremer the tension he has
          produced. But though we as yet only catch the outline of this poet's countenance, though
          we perceive nothing of its keenly satirical expression or of its now impudent, now merry
          smile, we nevertheless divine from the fervent youthful pathos that we are in the presence
          of the strongest personality in the literature of the day. There is an Ego in this poem
          which dominates every detail, an Ego which does not lose itself in any feeling, does not
          forget itself in any cause.</p>

        <p>The other literary personalities of the day could metamorphose–could etherealise,
          liquefy, crystallise–themselves; they could become invisible behind another personality,
          or transform themselves into cosmic beings, or merge themselves entirely in sensations
          received from without; but here we have an Ego which, whatever happens, is always
          conscious of itself, and always comes back to itself; and it is an agitated, passionate
          Ego, of whose emotions the movement of even the most unimportant lines reminds us, as the
          whisper of the shell reminds us of the roar of the ocean.</p>

        <p>Childe Harold (in the first draft Childe Burun) leaves his country after an ill-spent
          youth, in a mood of splenetic melancholy, leaving behind no friends and no loved one. His
          is the youthful weariness of life induced by a constitution and state of health inclining
          to melancholy, and <pb n="276"/> by an all too early satiety of pleasure. There is not a trace in him of
          the confident gaiety of youth or of its desire for amusement and fame; he believes, little
          as he has seen of life, that he has done with everything; and the poet is so completely
          one with his hero that not for one moment does he ever soar above him on the wings of
          irony.</p>

        <p>All this, which made such a powerful impression on the public of Byron's day, is
          tolerably unattractive to a critical modern reader; the aim at effect is plainly
          discernible, and the time when vague world-weariness was interesting is past. But no one
          with a practised eye can fail to see that in this case the mask–for mask it is–covers an
          earnest and a suffering countenance. The mask is that of a hermit; pluck it off, and there
          still remains a man of a solitary nature! The mask is grandiose melancholy; throw it away;
          beneath it there is real sadness! Harold's shell-bedecked pilgrim's cloak may be nothing
          but a kind of ball domino; but it covers a youth of ardent feelings, with a keen
          understanding, gloomy impressions of life, and an unusually strong love of freedom. In
          Childe Harold's better Ego there is no insincerity; Byron himself will be answerable for
          all his hero thinks and feels. And to those who remember what Byron's own conduct,
          immediately after he wrote <emph>Childe Harold</emph>, was, and who see a direct contradiction
          between the fictitious personage's elderly melancholy and the real personage's youthfully
          ardent pursuit of sensual pleasures, we reply, that the reason of the apparent
          contradiction is simply this–that Byron, who in his poetry was still an idealist, was
          unable to reveal his <emph>whole</emph> nature in the earlier cantos of <emph>Childe Harold</emph>. All that is
          there is certainly Byron, but there was in him, along with this, another and perfectly
          different man; and it was not until he wrote <emph>Don Juan</emph> that he succeeded in introducing
          this other Byron, as he lived and thought and spoke, into his poetry. The incompleteness
          of the self-description must not be mistaken for simulation or affectation.</p>

        <p>In February 1812 Byron made his maiden speech in Parliament. He spoke in behalf of the
          poor weavers of Nottingham, whom it was proposed to punish most severely <pb n="277"/> for having
          destroyed the machinery that was depriving them of their bread. It is a youthful and
          rather elaborate speech, but full of life and warmth. Byron was quite in his element in
          pleading the cause of the starving and desperate crowd. He very sensibly pointed out to
          his countrymen that a tenth part of the sum which they had willingly voted to enable the
          Portuguese to carry on war, would be sufficient to relieve the misery which it was
          proposed to reduce to silence by imprisonment and the gallows. Byron's vigorous and
          obstinate hatred of war is one of the grains of sound commonsense which are to be found in
          solution in his poetry; it lends animation to the earlier cantos of <emph>Childe Harold</emph>.</p>

        <p>His second Parliamentary speech was on the subject of Catholic Emancipation. Though it
          did not please, it is an excellent one; in it Byron acknowledges, and with correct logic
          disposes of, one of the arguments against giving religious liberty to the Catholics,
          namely, that it might equally well be given to the Jews. In reference to this same
          emancipation question, we find the following youthfully facetious entry in his notebook:
          »On one of the debates on the Catholic question, when we were either equal or within one
          (I forget which), I had been sent for in great haste to a ball, which I quitted, I
          confess, somewhat reluctantly, to emancipate five millions of people.« Playful utterances
          of this kind (as another example of which take his saying: »After all we must end in
          marriage; and I can conceive nothing more delightful than such a state in the country,
          reading the county newspaper, &amp;c, and kissing one's wife's maid«) have, because they
          are so little in keeping with Childe Harold's melancholy, amply proved to stupid people
          that nothing was sacred to him. The truth was that, being very young and somewhat of a
          coxcomb, he considered it derogatory to his dignity to express himself with any feeling;
          he unconsciously adopted as his motto the saying of St. Bernard: <emph>Plus labora celare
          virtutes quam vitia!</emph></p>

        <p>The maiden speech was a great success, and helped to draw the attention of the public to
          the first two cantos of <emph>Childe Harold</emph>, which came out only two days after the speech had
          been made. The impression produced by <emph>Childe Harold</emph> <pb n="278"/> was astounding; Byron
          instantaneously became a celebrity–London's new lion, the lawful sovereign of society for
          the year 1812. The metropolis, as represented by its most beautiful, most distinguished,
          most brilliant, and most cultivated inhabitants, prostrated itself at the feet of this
          youth of twenty-three. If these earlier cantos of <emph>Childe Harold</emph> had been distinguished
          by the qualities of the later, namely, profound originality and vigorous honesty, they
          would not have made the noise in the world they did. Great honesty and great originality
          never find favour at once with the general public. It was the veiledness, the vague
          weariness of the world and its pleasures, which impressed the crowd; the power of which
          they caught a glimpse, produced all the more effect by revealing itself in a somewhat
          theatrical manner.</p>

        <p>This was the heyday of dandyism. The upper class of London society, with Beau Brummell as
          its master of ceremonies, gave itself up to a luxuriousness and licentiousness which had
          not had their parallel since the days of Charles II. Dinner-parties and balls, the
          play-house, the gaming-table, pecuniary entanglements, amorous intrigues, seductions and
          the duels consequent thereon, occupied the days and nights of the aristocracy. And Byron
          was the hero of the day–nay, of the year. Could there have been a more suitable object
          for the admiration and worship of a society which was bored and burdened by its own
          inanity? So young, so handsome, and so wicked! For no one doubted but that he was as
          dangerous a roué as his hero. Byron had not Scott's coldbloodedness and mental equilibrium
          to oppose to temptations and flattery. He allowed himself to glide with the stream which
          supported him on its surface. The artist in him craved for an experience of every mood,
          and rejected none. He maintained his fame as a poet with ease; there followed on one
          another with short intervals his narrative poems, <emph>The Giaour</emph> (May 1813), <emph>The Bride of
          Abydos</emph> (December of the same year), and <emph>The Corsair</emph> (completed on New Year's Day 1814).
          Of this last work 13,000 copies were sold in one day. The bitter <emph>Ode to Napoleon</emph>, on the
          occasion of his abdication, showed that Byron, in his pursuit of poetry, was not entirely
          oblivious <pb n="279"/> of the political events of the day. In 1815 he wrote <emph>Parisina</emph> and <emph>The Siege
          of Corinth</emph>. The novelty, the foreignness, and the passion of these works, entranced the
          blasé aristocratic society of London. Their author was the prodigy on whom all eyes were
          turned. In the drawing-rooms young ladies trembled with the delightful hope that he might
          take them in to dinner, and at the dinner-table hardly dared to partake of what was set
          before them, because it was known that he did not like to see women eating. Owners of
          albums in which he had deigned to write a few lines were objects of envy. A specimen of
          his handwriting was in itself a treasure. People talked of all the Greek and Turkish women
          to whom his love must have meant death, and wondered how many husbands he had killed. His
          brow and his glancing eye suggested wickedness. He wore his hair unpowdered, and it was as
          wild as his passions. Different in everything from ordinary mortals, he was as abstemious
          as his Corsair; the other day at Lord ––-'s had he not let eleven courses go by untasted
          and asked for biscuits and soda-water? What an uncomfortable position for the lady of the
          house, who was so proud of her cook! And what an extraordinary piece of eccentricity in a
          country where a hearty appetite is one of the national virtues!</p>

        <p>We see Childe Harold transformed into Don Juan. The solitary pilgrim becomes the
          drawing-room lion. On the ladies, Byron's rank, youth, and remarkable beauty naturally
          made almost more impression than his poetry. In the Life of Sir Walter Scott we find the
          following opinion given by him on the subject of his fellow-author's personal appearance:
          »As for poets, I have seen, I believe, all the best of our own time and country–and,
          though Burns had the most glorious eyes imaginable, I never thought any of them would come
          up to an artist's notion of the character except Byron.... And the prints give one no
          impression of him–the lustre is there, but it is not lighted up. Byron's countenance is a
          thing to dream of.« One of the beauties of the day said to herself the first time she saw
          him: »That pale face is my fate.«</p>

        <p><pb n="280"/> Women had, undoubtedly, always occupied a large share of Byron's time and thoughts; but
          expressions in <emph>Childe Harold</emph> gave rise to the report that he had maintained a regular
          harem at Newstead–the harem appearing as a matter of fact to have consisted of one
          odalisque. Absurdly exaggerated stories were in circulation of the amorous adventures in
          which he had played the part of hero during his travels. The consequence of all this was
          that he was positively besieged by women; his table was covered every day with letters
          from ladies, known and unknown to him. One came to his house (probably in imitation of
          Kaled in <emph>Lara</emph>) disguised as a page; many came undisguised. He told Medwin that one day
          very soon after his wedding he found three married ladies in his wife's drawing-room, whom
          he at once recognised as »all birds of the same feather.«</p>

        <p>This life, crowded with empty pleasures and with triumphs for his vanity, at any rate
          suited Byron better than quiet; for, as he says in <emph>Childe Harold</emph>, »quiet to quick bosoms
          is a hell.« But, in all this whirl of excitement, did his heart ever really come into
          play? It would seem not. The love-affair which engrossed him much at this time and also
          influenced his future, was, as we know from his own letters, only a whirlpool within the
          whirlpool, and as such attracted him; but it left his heart quite cold.</p>

        <p>Lady Caroline Lamb, a young lady of good family, and wife of the statesman afterwards
          known as Lord Melbourne, had long cherished an ardent desire to make the acquaintance of
          the author of <emph>Childe Harold</emph>. Hers was a wild, fantastic, restless nature, which rebelled
          against every kind of control and promptly followed the inspiration of the moment;
          therefore she was in so far a kindred spirit of the poet. She was three years older than
          Byron, fair-haired, with a slender, beautiful figure, and a soft voice; her manner, though
          affected, was exceedingly attractive. She played in Byron's life the part which Frau von
          Kalb played in Schiller's.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">In Lady Morgan's <emph>Memoirs</emph> we find the following lively account by Lady Caroline Lamb
            herself of the beginning of her acquaintance with Byron:–»Lady Westmoreland knew him in
            Italy. She took on her to present him. The women suffocated him. I heard nothing of him,
            till one day Rogers (for he, Moore, and Spencer, were all my lovers)–Rogers said, 'You
            should know the new poet,' and he offered me the MS. of <emph>Childe Harold</emph> to read. I read
            it, and that was enough. Rogers said, 'He has a club-foot, and bites his nails.' I said,
            'If he was as ugly as Æsop I must know him.' I was one night at Lady Westmoreland's; the
            women were all throwing their heads at him. Lady Westmoreland led me up to him. I looked
            earnestly at him, and turned on my heel. My opinion in my journal was, 'mad–bad–and
            dangerous to know.' A day or two passed; I was sitting with Lord and Lady Holland, when he
            was announced. Lady Holland said, 'I must present Lord Byron to you.' Lord Byron said,
            'That offer was made to you before; may I ask why you rejected it?' He begged permission
            to come and see me. He did so the next day. Rogers and Moore were standing by me: I was on
            the sofa. I had just come in from riding. I was filthy and heated. When Lord Byron was
            announced, I flew out of the room to wash myself. When I returned, Rogers said, 'Lord
            Byron, you are a happy man. Lady Caroline has been sitting here in all her dirt with us,
            but when you were announced, she flew to beautify herself.... From that moment, for more
            than nine months, he almost lived at Melbourne House. It was then the centre of all
            gaiety, at least, in appearance.... All the <emph>bon ton</emph> of London assembled here every day.
            There was nothing so fashionable, Byron contrived to sweep them all away.« These
            utterances, reported with stenographic exactness, give an excellent idea of the
            fashionable life of the day in London.</note> <pb n="281"/> Her connection with him made the lady so much talked of,
          that her mother did everything in her power to break it off. Lady Caroline was at last
          persuaded to go to Ireland on a visit. Byron wrote a farewell letter to her, of which she
          allowed Lady Morgan to make a copy–a letter which is typical of his style in his immature
          years, and in which no one with any knowledge of the human heart will find the language of
          love. It reminds us of Hamlet's ambiguous letter to Ophelia.</p>

        <p>»If tears which you saw, and know I am not apt to shed,–if the agitation in which I
          parted from you,–agitation which you must have perceived through the whole of this most
          nervous affair, did not commence until the moment of leaving you approached,–if all I
          have said and done, and am still but too ready to say and do, have not sufficiently proved
          what my real feelings are, and must ever be towards you, my love, I have no other proof to
          offer.... Is there anything in earth or heaven that would have made me so happy as to have
          made you mine long ago? You know I would with pleasure give up all here and beyond the
          grave for you, and in refraining from this, must my motives be misunderstood? I care not
          who knows this, what use is made of it,–it is to you and to you only that they are, <pb n="282"/> <emph>yourself</emph>, I was and am yours freely and entirely to obey, to honour, love, and fly with
          you when, where, and how yourself <emph>might</emph> and <emph>may</emph> determine.«</p>

        <p>It will surprise no one to learn that a few months later Byron himself put an end to the
          <emph>liaison</emph>; his love had never been anything but the kind of reflected love which imitates
          in a mirror all the motions of the flame, without fire of its own. Meeting Byron at a ball
          soon afterwards, Lady Caroline, maddened by his indifference, seized the first sharp thing
          that she could lay hold of–some say a pair of scissors, others a broken glass–and tried
          to cut her throat with it. After the ineffectual attempt at suicide, she (according to
          Countess Guiccioli) made »the most incredible promises« to a young nobleman on condition
          that he would challenge and kill the faithless one; nevertheless she herself soon called
          at her quondam lover's apartments, »by no means with the intention of cutting either her
          own throat or his.« He was not at home. The words which she wrote on a title-page of a
          book she found on his table, inspired the epigram: »Remember thee!« which is to be found
          amongst Byron's poems.</p>

        <p>Pining for revenge, Lady Caroline now seized her pen and wrote the novel, <emph>Glenarvon</emph>,
          which came out at the most unfortunate moment possible for Byron, namely, just after his
          wife had left him, and was one of the most active ingredients in the ferment of public
          disapproval. The book, which has as its motto two lines from <emph>The Corsair</emph>:–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»He left a name to all succeeding times,</l>
          <l>Link'd with one virtue and a thousand crimes,«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>pictures Byron as a perfect demon of dissimulation and wickedness, endowed with all his
          hero's worst characteristics. But, possibly by way of excuse for her own conduct, the
          authoress has not been able to resist giving him some admirable and attractive qualities.
          One passage runs: »Had he betrayed in his manner that freedom, that familiarity so
          offensive in men, but yet so frequent amongst them, she would have shuddered; but from
          what was she to fly? Not from the gross adulation, or the easy, flippant protestations <pb n="283"/> to
          which all women are, soon or late, accustomed; but from a respect at once refined and
          flattering, an attention devoted even to her least wishes, yet without appearing
          subservient a gentleness and sweetness as rare as they were fascinating; and these
          combined with all the powers of imagination, vigour of intellect, and brilliancy of wit
          which none ever before possessed in so eminent a degree.«</p>

        <p>In 1817, when Byron was living in Venice, an Italian translation of <emph>Glenarvon</emph> was sent
          to press there. The censor refused to sanction its publication until he had ascertained if
          Lord Byron had any objections. Byron assured him that he had none. Only once again in the
          biography of Lord Byron is mention made of Lady Caroline Lamb. As the funeral procession
          following his corpse (which had been brought home from Greece) was slowly making its way
          from London to Newstead, it was met by a lady and gentleman on horseback. The lady
          inquired who it was that was to be buried. When she heard, she fell fainting from her
          horse. She was the authoress of <emph>Glenarvon</emph>.</p>

        <p>Byron's giddy, wild London career was arrested by the most fateful event of his life–his
          marriage. Life, as he had lived it, had not inspired him with much respect for woman; but
          the kind of woman he loved was the devoted, self-sacrificing creature whom he delighted in
          portraying in his poems. The woman whom chance made his wife had a strong, obstinate
          English character. Miss Anne Isabella Milbanke was the only child of a rich baronet. Byron
          was attracted by her simplicity and modesty, and tempted by the prospect of restoring
          Newstead with the help of her fortune. She annoyed him by refusing his hand when he first
          offered it to her, but fascinated him again by soon afterwards beginning a friendly
          correspondence with him of her own accord. In course of time she returned a favourable
          answer to a letter of proposal which he had written in an unwarrantably frivolous mood,
          and sent because a friend who read it thought it a pity that such »a pretty letter« should
          not go.</p>

        <p>From motives which were, one and all, bad–motives of vanity, motives of vulgar
          aggrandisement–Byron rushed <pb n="284"/> into a marriage which did not end worse than might have been
          expected. His mood during his engagement was a comparatively cheerful one. »Of course I am
          very much in love,« he writes to a lady friend, »and as silly as all single gentlemen must
          be in that sentimental situation.« And to another friend he writes: »I am now the happiest
          of mortals, for I became engaged a week ago. Yesterday I met young F., also the happiest
          of mortals, for he too is engaged.« So childish are all the letters written at this time
          that, if we believe them, we must suppose Byron's only serious trouble to have been the
          necessity of being married in a blue coat. However, as the wedding-day approached, he
          became ever more ill at ease; the relations between his parents had early inoculated him
          with a dread of marriage. His feelings during the wedding ceremony he has described in
          <emph>The Dream</emph>. He told Medwin that he trembled and gave wrong answers.</p>

        <p>»The treacle-moon,« as Byron calls it, did not run its course unshadowed by clouds. Two
          months after his marriage he writes to Moore from the country, where he and his wife were
          staying with her parents: »I am in a state of sameness and stagnation, totally occupied in
          consuming the fruits, and sauntering, and playing dull games at cards, and yawning, and
          trying to read old Annual Registers and the daily papers, and gathering shells on the
          shore, and watching the growth of stunted gooseberry bushes in the garden.« A few days
          later he writes: »I have been very comfortable here–listening to that d–d monologue
          which elderly gentlemen call conversation, and in which my pious father-in-law repeats
          himself every evening–save one, when he played upon the fiddle. However, they have been
          very kind and hospitable.... Bell is in health and unvaried good-humour and
          behaviour.«</p>

        <p>Pegasus was beginning to feel the yoke gall. However, the young couple presently went to
          London, where they lived in great style, keeping carriages and horses, and entertaining
          sumptuously, until Byron's creditors began to push their claims. Lady Byron's dowry of
          £10,000 disappeared like dew in sunshine, quickly followed by £8000, to which <pb n="285"/> Byron had
          lately fallen heir. Things became so bad that he had to sell his library. In order to
          prevent this sale, Murray, his publisher, offered him £1500 as remuneration for his
          writings; but Byron's false pride led him to return the draft torn in pieces. Eight
          executions followed on each other in as many months; the very beds were seized at
          last.</p>

        <p>Such was the position of affairs when, in December 1815, Lady Byron gave birth to her
          daughter Ada.</p>

        <p>The spoiled young heiress had, of course, never dreamt that such experiences awaited her.
          The married life of the couple was at first by no means unhappy. They drove out together,
          and the young wife waited patiently in the carriage while her husband paid calls. She
          wrote letters for him and copied out poems, among others <emph>The Bride of Corinth</emph>. But there
          had very soon been small misunderstandings. Lady Byron seems to have been in the habit of
          constantly interrupting her husband with questions and remarks when he was writing,
          thereby giving occasion to outbursts of temper which she considered most unseemly. She had
          had no experience of such passionate violence and eccentric behaviour as she was soon to
          witness. On one occasion she saw Byron, when in a passion, throw his watch into the fire
          and break it to pieces with the poker; on another, in fun or by accident, he fired off a
          pistol in her room. Ere long, too, she was suffering the pangs of jealousy. She knew of
          his notoriety as the hero of many amours, and knew more particularly about his connection
          with Lady Caroline Lamb, who was her own near relative. Byron had, unfortunately for his
          domestic peace, become a member of the Committee of Management of Drury Lane Theatre, and
          his correct lady was much perturbed by the business relations with actresses, singers, and
          ballet-dancers which this entailed. A person in her service (described by Lord Byron in <emph>A
          Sketch</emph>) began to act the spy, ransacking Byron's drawers and reading his letters. And
          there is yet another disagreeable matter, which we shall notice later.</p>

        <p>With her husband's consent, the young wife, about a month after the child's birth, left
          the unsettled and unhappy <pb n="286"/> home, and went on a visit to her parents. But hardly had she
          arrived before her father intimated to Byron that she would not return to him. While on
          the journey she had written a letter to him (now in print) which begins: »Dear Duck,« and
          ends quite as affectionately. Byron's surprise may be imagined. He replied to his
          father-in-law that in this matter he could not acknowledge paternal authority, and must
          hear from his wife herself. Her communication was to the same effect. In 1830 Lady Byron
          publicly affirmed that she had written to her husband as affectionately as she did, in the
          belief that he was insane; and that if this idea of hers had proved to be the correct one,
          she would have borne everything as his faithful wife, but that in no other case could she
          have continued to live with him.</p>

        <p>In a fragment of a novel, written by Byron in 1817, we have a corroboration of this
          assertion:–»A few days after, she set out for Aragon, with my son, on a visit to her
          father and mother. I did not accompany her immediately, having been in Aragon before....
          During her journey I received a very affectionate letter from Donna Josepha, apprising me
          of the welfare of herself and my son. On her arrival at the château, I received another,
          still more affectionate, pressing me, in very fond and rather foolish terms, to join her
          immediately. As I was preparing to set out from Seville, I received a third–this was from
          her father, Don José di Cardozo, who requested me, in the politest manner, to dissolve our
          marriage. I answered him, with equal politeness, that I would do no such thing. A fourth
          letter arrived–it was from Donna Josepha, in which she informed me that her father's
          letter was written by her particular desire. I requested the reason by return of post: she
          replied, by express, that as reason had nothing to do with the matter, it was unnecessary
          to give any–but that she was an injured and excellent woman. I then inquired why she had
          written to me the two preceding affectionate letters, requesting me to come to Aragon. She
          answered, that was because she believed me out of my senses–that, being unfit to take
          care of myself, I had only to set out on this journey alone, and, making my way without
          difficulty to Don José di Cardozo's, <pb n="287"/> I should there have found the tenderest of wives
          and–a strait-waistcoat.«</p>

        <p>When it became known that Byron's wife had left him, a sudden and complete change in the
          attitude of the public towards him took place. He had awakened one morning after the
          publication of <emph>Childe Harold</emph> to find himself famous; now came a morning when he awoke to
          find himself infamous, regarded by society as an outlaw.</p>

        <p>Chief among the causes of this revulsion was envy–not that envy in the hearts of the
          gods which the ancients regarded as the cause of the downfall of the great–but foul, base
          envy in the breasts of his fellow-men. He stood so high; he was so great; with all his
          faults he had never sunk to the level of vulgar, mechanical respectability; confident in
          his powers and the favour of fortune, he had never deigned to seek friends who could
          protect him, or heeded how many enemies he made. These latter had long been innumerable.
          Chief among the envious were his literary rivals; and amongst all the many species of
          envy, the envy of authors is one of the most venomous. He had derided them, had called
          them the writers of a decadent period, had taken from some the name they had won, and made
          it impossible for others to win a name–why should he be admired and idolised whilst they
          were in vain arranging their locks for the reception of a wreath which never came? What
          joy to be able to tear him from the golden throne of fame and besmirch him with the mud in
          which they themselves stood!</p>

        <p>He had long been suspected and secretly hated by the orthodox in religion and politics.
          The couple of stanzas in <emph>Childe Harold</emph> which venture in the most cautious terms to
          express a doubt that we shall meet our friends again after death, had been greeted with a
          cry of–heresy! and a whole book, <emph>Anti-Byron</emph>, had been written against them. The two
          verses to the Princess Charlotte, which, under the title, <emph>Lines to a Lady Weeping</emph>, were
          appended to the first edition of <emph>The Corsair</emph>, and in which the poet condoles with the
          daughter on the occasion of her father, the Prince Regent's, desertion of the Liberal side
          in politics, had set the whole Tory party violently against him. But hitherto he had been
          protected <pb n="288"/> by his magic influence over men's minds as by an invisible coat of mail. This
          unfortunate episode in his private life offered a weak point, against which his enemies
          diverted the full force of public opinion.</p>

        <p>The life led by Lady Byron and her family was the life on which English public opinion
          has set the seal of its peculiar approbation; and it was easy to convince the public that
          the man whom such a wife felt obliged to leave must indeed be a monster. Rumours began to
          spread; the slanders once conceived and brought forth, developed feet to walk on, wings to
          fly with, and swelled as they flew. Their voices rose from a whisper to a cry, from a cry
          to a deafening roar. Who does not know that concerted piece in the production of which
          baseness and stupidity collaborate, and during the performance of which ignorance sings in
          chorus with conscious villainy, whilst spite heightens the effect by the contribution of
          its most piercing trills!</p>

        <p>Envy in this case entered the service of hypocrisy, and took its wages. Refined hypocrisy
          was, far on into the nineteenth century–as long, namely, as the period of religious
          reaction lasted–a social power, the authority of which differed from that of the
          Inquisitional tribunals of the sixteenth century only in the means it employed, not in the
          reach and efficacy of these means. It wrought through public opinion, and public opinion
          had become what Byron calls it in <emph>Childe Harold</emph>,</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»an omnipotence,–whose veil</l>
          <l>Mantles the earth with darkness, until right</l>
          <l>And wrong are accidents, and men grow pale</l>
          <l>Lest their own judgments should become too bright,</l>
          <l>And their free thoughts be crimes, and earth have too much light.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>As for hypocrisy, he felt incapable of doing justice to it unaided. »Oh for a
          forty-parson power!« he cries in <emph>Don Juan</emph>:–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Oh for a <emph>forty-parson power</emph> to chant</l>
          <l>Thy praise, Hypocrisy! Oh for a hymn</l>
          <l>Loud as the virtues thou dost loudly vaunt,</l>
          <l>Not practise! Oh for trump of cherubim!«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p><pb n="289"/> Such a state of matters was inevitable at a period which has so much in common with the
          age when the ancient religions and theories of life were in process of dissolution; a
          period when an old theological theory of the universe and of life, everywhere undermined
          and riddled by science, and unable to support itself by its own inherent truth, was
          obliged to cling to the conventional morality of the upper classes, which it made as rigid
          as possible in order to have a support in it; a period when ecclesiastical authority and
          narrow-minded social conservatism, both in a tottering condition, were endeavouring to
          uphold each other. Taking a bird's-eye view of the psychological history of Europe during
          the first two decades of the century, it actually seems to us as if the whole edifice of
          hypocrisy, the foundations of which were laid in the writings of the French <emph>émigrés</emph>,
          which rose steadily in those of the German Romanticists, and towered to a giddy height
          during the French Reaction, now suddenly fell on the head of one man.</p>

        <p>Macaulay, in his essay on Moore's <emph>Life of Byron</emph>, writing on this subject, says:–»We
          know no spectacle so ridiculous as the British public in one of its periodical fits of
          morality. In general, elopements, divorces, and family quarrels, pass with little notice.
          We read the scandal, talk about it for a day, and forget it. But once in six or seven
          years our virtue becomes outrageous. We cannot suffer the laws of religion and decency to
          be violated. We must make a stand against vice. We must teach libertines that the English
          people appreciate the importance of domestic ties. Accordingly some unfortunate man, in no
          respect more depraved than hundreds whose offences have been treated with lenity, is
          singled out as an expiatory sacrifice. If he has children, they are to be taken from him.
          If he has a profession, he is to be driven from it. He is cut by the higher orders, and
          hissed by the lower. He is, in truth, a sort of whipping-boy, by whose vicarious agonies
          all the other transgressors of the same class are, it is supposed, sufficiently chastised.
          We reflect very complacently on our own severity, and compare with great pride the high
          standard of morals established in England with the <pb n="290"/> Parisian laxity. At length our anger is
          satiated. Our victim is ruined and heart-broken. And our virtue goes quietly to sleep for
          seven years more.«</p>

        <p>If the causes of Byron's downfall were of a complex nature, the means were simple enough.
          It was compassed by the Press, the only effective instrument in such cases. Several of the
          papers and magazines had taken the opportunity to spread slanders about him when
          criticising his verses to the Princess Charlotte; and more than one of them periodically
          calumniated him. Now they were all at liberty to discuss and attack his private life
          freely, thanks to the anonymity which, in spite of the want of naturalness and the
          corruption it entails, still prevails in the English Press. What anonymity really means is
          simply this, that the paltriest scribbler, who is hardly fit to hold the pen with which he
          writes his lies, is enabled to put the trumpet of moral public opinion to his lips, and
          let the voice of injured virtue resound in thousands of homes. Nor is it enough that the
          one anonymous writer should be able to constitute himself the voice of the public in the
          thousands of copies of one newspaper; he can assume hundreds of forms, can write with all
          kinds of fanciful signatures, and in a dozen different newspapers and magazines. A single
          scribbler would have sufficed to provide the whole Press with base attacks on a man
          outlawed by public opinion; it is easy, then, to imagine the number that were made on
          Byron, whose enemies were legion. Among the names given him by the Press he himself
          remembered Nero, Apicius, Caligula, Heliogabalus, and Henry VIII.–that is to say, he was
          accused of inhuman cruelty, of insane brutality, of animal and unnatural lust; he was
          painted with all the colours which vileness smears on its palette. The most terrible of
          all the accusations was that which even then went the round of the newspapers, and which
          sullied the fair name of the being dearest to him–the accusation of incest. And to all
          this he could not answer a word! He could not fight with the mire that bespattered
          him.</p>

        <p>Slanders sped from mouth to mouth. When Mrs. Mardyn, the Drury Lane actress, made her
          first appearance <pb n="291"/> after the divorce, she was hissed off the stage, because of the perfectly
          groundless report of a <emph>liaison</emph> between her and Byron, to whom, as a matter of fact, she
          had only spoken twice. He himself could not appear on the streets without danger. On his
          way to the House of Lords, where his presence was ignored, he was insulted by a
          respectable crowd.</p>

        <p>Defence or retort being impossible, no course was left him, proud as he was, but to bow
          his head and go. »I felt,« he writes, »that, if what was whispered, and muttered, and
          murmured, was true, I was unfit for England; if false, England was unfit for me.« On the
          25th of April, 1816, he set sail, never to return alive.</p>

        <p>It is from this moment that Byron's true greatness dates. The blow struck by the
          <emph>Edinburgh Review</emph> had roused him, for the first time, to intellectual activity. This new
          blow made of him a knight. There is no comparison possible between what Byron wrote
          before, and what he wrote after, the event which he himself regarded as his greatest
          misfortune. It was a misfortune sent him by the genius of History, to snatch him from the
          unmanning influence of idolisation, to sever the enfeebling connection between him and
          that society and social spirit against which it was his historic mission to arouse, with
          more fortune and more power than any other individual, the hostility which was its
          undoing.</p>

        <p>When he had become for the second time a homeless and solitary pilgrim, Byron began to
          occupy himself again with the poem of travel in which his youthful sentiments had found
          expression. He added the Third and Fourth Cantos to <emph>Childe Harold</emph>. He turned back and
          felt the youthful feelings once again. But what breadth and depth they had gained in the
          interval! The chord struck in the First and Second Cantos was composed of three notes–the
          note of solitariness, the note of melancholy, and the note of freedom. Each one of these
          had become far clearer and more resonant.</p>

        <p>Throughout the first half of the work it is the feeling of solitariness which produces
          the love of nature. »To sit on rocks, to muse o'er flood and fell,« to climb the trackless
          mountain and lean over the foaming waterfall, alone, was not solitariness, but communion
          with nature; true solitariness was to wander amidst »the crowd, the hum, the shock of
          men,« unloving and unloved. (<emph>Childe Harold</emph>, ii. 25, 26, 27.) The outbursts in the
          stanzas referred to are evoked by remembrances of the poet's childhood, spent in the
          beautiful mountain districts of Scotland, or of his visit to the hermit's home on »lonely
          Athos.« This was still a love of the solitude of nature which resembled Wordsworth's, and
          which was based upon fear of an unknown, strange world of men and women. The difference
          between Wordsworth's and Byron's feeling was no more than this–that Wordsworth dwelt
          silently on the natural impression, in the manner of the countryman and the landscape
          painter, while Byron seized it with the longing, nervous ardour of the townsman; and,
          moreover, that Wordsworth loved nature best in her quiet moods, Byron in her wrath.
          (<emph>Childe Harold</emph>, ii. 37.)</p>

        <p><pb n="293"/> In the second half of the work the character of the poet's solitariness has changed.
          There is a marked difference between the desire for solitary communion with nature which
          Harold felt as an inexperienced youth, and that which he felt as a man, at the end of his
          first circumnavigation of the world of men and things. It was now no longer fear of human
          beings, but disgust with them, which drove him to take refuge with nature. Society, the
          best society of a great metropolis, which to the untrained eye seemed so humane, so
          right-thinking, so refined and chivalrous, had turned its wrong side towards him–and the
          wrong side is interesting, but not beautiful. He had learned how much friendship the
          ruined man may reckon on, had learned that the only force which he who is making plans for
          his future can exactly calculate is the self-love of his fellow-men, with its
          consequences. So he withdrew into himself again; and the poetry he wrote at this time is
          not for men of a sociable nature. But the man who has had even a short experience of what
          it is to turn his back on his fellow-men–who in his desire to escape from them has left
          his home, his country, in search of a new earth and new skies–who in the solitudes of his
          choice has felt the sight of an approaching human being equivalent to a foul spot on his
          pure, free horizon–in the souls of this man and his like, Byron's lyric outbursts will
          find an echo.</p>

        <p>Childe Harold is a solitary. He has learned that he is »the most unfit of men to herd
          with man,« because he is unable »to submit his thoughts to others ... to yield dominion of
          his mind to spirits against whom his own rebelled.« But,</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Where rose the mountains, there to him were friends;</l>
          <l>Where roll'd the ocean, thereon was his home.</l>
          <l>…</l>
          <l>The desert, forest, cavern, breaker's foam,</l>
          <l>Were unto him companionship; they spake</l>
          <l>A mutual language, clearer than the tome</l>
          <l>Of his land's tongue, which he would oft forsake</l>
          <l>For Nature's pages glass'd by sunbeams on the lake.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>Amongst men he droops like a wild-born falcon with clipt wing. But in his case, to fly
          from, is not to hate, mankind. <pb n="294"/> It is not discontent or defiance which keeps his »mind deep
          in its fountain,« but fear lest it should »overboil in the hot throng,« where in a
          moment</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»We may plunge our years</l>

        <p>He feels that it is better to be alone, and thus to become a portion of what surrounds
          him. High mountains are »a feeling« to him, but the hum of human cities is a torture. The
          mountain, the sky, and the sea are a part of him, and he is a part of them, and to love
          them is his purest happiness. In solitude he is least alone; then his soul is conscious of
          infinity, a truth which purifies it from self. Harold has not loved the world, nor has it
          loved him. He is proud of not having »flattered its rank breath,« nor bowed the knee to
          its idols, nor smiled hypocritically, nor echoed the cries of the crowd. He was <emph>among</emph>
          them, but not <emph>of</emph> them. But he desires that the world and he should part fair foes. »I do

        <p>The feeling of solitariness gradually becomes the feeling of <emph>melancholy</emph>. This note,
          too, had been struck in the first two cantos; but their melancholy was nothing but the
          discontent of youth. With a wasted youth behind him, he had stood, like a phlegmatically
          mournful Hamlet, at the grave of Achilles, declaiming, with a skull in his hand, on the
          worthlessness of life and fame–this young poet who had not yet tasted the sweetness of
          celebrity, and who in reality hungered for nothing so much as for that very fame which,
          with so much argumentative philosophy, he feigned to condemn and despise. Now he has

        <p>In the depth of his dejection he turns to the element in nature which, by its contrast
          with his present mood, solaces his sufferings–the sea, the free, open sea, upon whose
          mane he had laid his hand as a boy, and which knows him as the horse knows his rider. He
          loves the sea because it is unconquerable, because time cannot even write a wrinkle on its
          brow, and it rolls now as it rolled at the dawn of creation. But everything in nature
          reminds him of suffering and warfare. The peal of distant thunder is to him an alarm-bell,
          »the knoll of what in me is sleepless–if I rest.« Even the beautiful, calm lake of Nemi
          does not remind him of anything peaceful and sweet; he calls it »calm as cherished hate.«
          (iv. 173.)</p>

        <p>His melancholy becomes actually choleric. Could he breathe all his passion »into <emph>one</emph>
          word, and that one word were Lightning,« he would speak. »Anything but rest!« is his
          watchword. »Quiet to quick bosoms is a hell.« There is a fire in the soul which, once
          kindled, is quenchless, and the flames of which rise ever higher and wilder; there is a
          fever which is fatal to all whom it attacks.</p>

        <p>In the First Canto of <emph>Childe Harold</emph> we already find the <emph>love of freedom</emph> (the third
          note in the chord struck by the poem) exalted as the one force capable of emancipating
          from the despair with which the universal misery (the <emph>Weltschmerz</emph>, as the Germans call
          it) has overwhelmed the soul. It has this power because it provides a practical task.
          During his first visit to Portugal, Childe Harold exclaimed: »Oh, that such hills upheld a
          free-born race!« And to the Spaniards he cried:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>

        <p>And it was in the course of his first tour, too, that he thus apostrophised the
          subjugated Greeks, who went on hoping for help from other nations:–</p>

          <l>When Grecian mothers shall give birth to men,</l>
          <l>Then may'st thou be restored; but not till then.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>But his love of liberty at that time was of a purely political nature; it was the
          free-born Englishman's indignation at seeing other nations unable to shake off a foreign
          yoke to which his own nation would never have dreamt of submitting.</p>

        <p>Now he has learned what liberty in the wide, full, universal meaning of the word is. Now
          he feels that free <emph>thought</emph> is the first essential requisite of all spiritual life.</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>

        <p>And it is his intention not merely to ponder, but to act. Invoking Time, the great

        <p>he concludes with the prayer: »Let me not have worn this iron in my soul in vain!«</p>

        <p>Now, his personal woes shrink into nothing when he beholds the gigantic ruins of Rome;
          and, like the Sulpicius <pb n="298"/> with whose feelings Chateaubriand endowed the hero of <emph>Les
          Martyrs</emph>, he feels the insignificance of his fate compared with that which has swept away
          the cities of Greece. He writes:–</p>

        <p>And when, not satisfied with liberty of thought alone, he turns his attention to
          practical matters and occupies himself with the great political struggles of the day, he
          does not content himself with repeating the old invocations to the departed, or with
          crying to Venice that she has drowned the glory and honour of centuries in the mire of
          slavery, and that it would be better for her to be whelm'd beneath the waves. No, he
          boldly attacks the mighty, the victors of Waterloo, whom he scornfully calls »the apes of
          him who humbled once the proud«; and then passes from the outward, political aspect of the
          great European conflicts, to their inner, social significance.</p>

        <p>To all appearance, he says, France has uprooted old prejudices, and laid in ruins »things
          which grew, breathed from the birth of time,« only to see dungeons and thrones rebuilt
          upon the same foundation. »<emph>But this will not endure</emph>.« Mankind have at last felt their

        <p>Thus do the three chief feelings expressed in this beautiful poem–solitariness,
          melancholy, and love of freedom–gradually become one greater feeling; the mind of the
          poet widens and deepens with each canto. Wordsworth had identified his Ego with England;
          Scott and Moore had given the feelings of Scotland and Ireland expression in their poetry;
          but Byron's Ego represents universal humanity; its sorrows and hopes are those of all
          mankind. After this Ego has, in manly, energetic style, withdrawn into itself and lived
          for a time absorbed in its solitary grief, that grief widens into compassion for all the
          sufferings and sorrows of humanity; the hard, selfish crust of the Ego is broken, and
          there issues forth the ardent love of liberty, to encompass and to elevate the poet's
          whole generation. Now his mind is attuned to worship, and he cries:–</p>

      <head type="add">20. Byron: The Revolutionary Spirit</head>
        <head><pb n="[300]"/> XX. BYRON: THE REVOLUTIONARY SPIRIT</head>

        <p>After visiting the battle-field of Waterloo, Byron went, by way of the Rhine, to
          Switzerland, where he spent several months, residing most of the time in the neighbourhood
          of Geneva. In a boarding-house there, he for the first time met Shelley. Shelley, who was
          Byron's junior by four years, had sent him, at the time of its publication, a copy of
          <emph>Queen Mab</emph>; but the letter accompanying the book had miscarried, and no further
          communication had passed between them, Shelley had arrived at Geneva a fortnight before
          Byron, accompanied by Mary Godwin and her step-sister, Miss Jane Clairmont, who had always
          passionately admired Byron. His illegitimate daughter Allegra was the fruit of the brief
          connection between him and this young lady.</p>

        <p>Intercourse with Shelley produced on Byron's mind some of the strongest, deepest
          impressions which it was capable of receiving. The first great impression was that made by
          Shelley's personality and view of life. In him Byron for the first time came into contact
          with a man of a perfectly modern and perfectly emancipated mind. In spite of his genius
          for assimilating everything that harmonised with his own nature, it was but a half
          education, in philosophy as in literature, which Byron had received; and he had hitherto,
          been led by sympathies rather than convictions. Now Shelley, glowing with the enthusiasm
          of an apostle, his doubts long since disposed of, a true priest of humanism, came across
          his path. The dissipated life of London society, and the pressing burden of his private
          misfortunes, had allowed Byron neither tranquillity of mind nor leisure to reflect on the
          problems of existence or on the reformation of humanity; he had been too much occupied
          with himself. <pb n="301"/> Now, at the moment in his literary career when his Ego was beginning to
          expand, he was brought into contact with a spirit which baptized with fire. He gladly
          welcomed the new influence; and in much of what he now wrote it is plainly perceptible.
          The numerous pantheistic outbursts in the Third Canto of <emph>Childe Harold</emph> are undoubtedly,
          one and all, the fruit of conversations with Shelley; worthy of special attention is the
          beautiful passage (iii. ioo) in which everything in Nature is assumed to be a
          manifestation of »undying Love«–an expression of Shelley's theory of love and beauty
          being the mysterious powers which uphold the world. In one of the notes in his journal,
          Byron at this time goes so far in his Shelley-derived pantheism as to write: »The feeling
          with which all around Clarens and the opposite rocks of Meillerie is invested, is of a
          still higher and more comprehensive order than the mere sympathy with individual passion;
          it is a sense of the existence of love in its most extended and sublime capacity, and of
          our own participation of its good and of its glory: it is the great principle of the
          universe, which is there more condensed, but not less manifested; and of which, though
          knowing ourselves a part, we lose our individuality, and mingle in the beauty of the
          whole.«</p>

        <p>Shelley's influence is also traceable in the spirit scenes in <emph>Manfred</emph>, and very
          specially in the third act of the drama, which was re-written by his advice. And as to
          <emph>Cain</emph>, even if Shelley, as he affirms, had no actual share in the writing of the work, it
          certainly would not have been what it is if Byron had never known him.</p>

        <p>The two poets saw Chillon and all its beautiful surroundings in company; and Byron
          received the second great impression which was to bear fruit in his poetry–the impression
          of the Alps. Coming from the confinement and close atmosphere of the London drawing-rooms,
          it was a relief to him to let his eye rest on the eternal snow, and the giant peaks that
          tower sky-high above the haunts of men. His poetic forerunner, Chateaubriand, hated the
          Alps; their grandeur had an oppressive effect on his vanity; Byron felt at home among
          them.</p>

        <p><pb n="302"/> <emph>Manfred</emph>, which derives its truest claim to admiration from its matchlessness as an
          Alpine landscape, was a direct result of the impressions of nature received at this time.
          Taine let himself be tempted to use the strong expression, that Byron's Alpine Spirits in
          <emph>Manfred</emph> are only stage gods; but Taine, when he wrote this, did not himself know
          Switzerland.</p>

        <p>Nowhere else do circumstances in the same degree incline the mind to the personification
          of nature. Even the ordinary traveller feels the temptation. I remember standing one
          evening on the summit of the Righi, looking down on the beautiful lakes at the foot of the
          mountain, and the vapoury clouds which were driving across them, quite close to their
          surface. Suddenly, far away on the horizon, a little solid white cloud appeared. By the
          time it had reached Pilatus, a minute later, it was an enormous vapoury mass. With
          frightful speed it rushed onwards, covering the whole sky with the league-wide flaps of
          its mantle. Sinking down towards the lakes, it enveloped the mountain peaks, rode along
          the ridges, filled the hollows; then, spreading itself out still wider, it mounted in
          circles like smoke towards the sky, and sank like lead over the towns and villages,
          effacing every colour, and turning the whole into one monotonous expanse of grey. The
          white of the snow, the green of the trees, the thousand gleams and colours of the sunlit
          clouds were deluged and gone in one moment. The eye, which had but a second before been
          wandering at will over the immeasurable expanse now, irresistibly attracted, gazed
          steadfastly at the shapeless mass, which, tearing through the sky with the force of a
          sphere in its earliest stage, rapidly approached the beholder. It was like the hosts of
          heaven, like hundreds of thousands of ethereal riders, sweeping onwards in closed ranks
          upon winged, silent horses, and, more irresistible than any earthly army, tracklessly
          effacing everything behind them, like the hordes of Asia or Attila's Huns. A Scandinavian
          could not but think of the ride of the Valkyries. The moment the cloud reached the Righi,
          the watchers there began to lose sight of each other; first one, then another, disappeared
          from the view of his companions; the mist <pb n="303"/> slung itself in a clammy, tight embrace round
          each one, closing his mouth and weighing on his breast.</p>

        <p>Natural phenomena of this description suggested the apparitions which appear to Manfred.
          Passage after passage from Byron's journal is incorporated in his poem. Not unfrequently
          the entries in their original, careless form are fully as effective as when transcribed in
          verse. »Arrived at the Grindelwald; dined; mounted again, and rode to the higher
          glacier–like <emph>a frozen hurricane</emph>. (In Manfred, for the sake of the verse–»a tumbling
          tempest's foam, frozen in a moment.«) Starlight, beautiful, but a devil of a path! ... A
          little lightning; but the whole of the day as fine in point of weather as the day on which
          Paradise was made. Passed <emph>whole woods of withered pines, all withered</emph>; trunks stripped
          and barkless, branches lifeless; done by a single winter,–their appearance reminded me of
          me and my family.« All these expressions occur, with slight alterations, in the poem.</p>

        <p>But the time Shelley and Byron spent together, profitable and enjoyable as it was, would
          have been happier but for the behaviour of some of their fellow-countrymen, whose
          curiosity led them to dog the footsteps and spy the actions of the two poets. English
          tourists had the incredible impertinence to force their way into Byron's house. When a
          stop was put to this, they stood with telescopes on the shore or on the road; they looked
          over the garden-wall; and hotel waiters were bribed, as the Venetian gondoliers afterwards
          were, to communicate all that went on. The first report set in circulation was, that Byron
          and Shelley lived in »promiscuous intercourse« with two sisters; and, gossip by degrees
          making the two poets out to be incarnate devils, the reports gained steadily in
          repulsiveness. It consequently hardly surprises us to read that, one day at Madame de
          Staël's, when Byron was announced, a pious old English lady, Mrs. Hervey, the
          novel-writer, fainted when she heard the name, as if, says Byron, it had been »his Satanic
          majesty« himself who was appearing.</p>

        <p>Our attempt to understand this actual fear of Byron's person, which to us appears so
          absurd, leads us to the consideration of the last great impression received by him during <pb n="304"/> his stay by the Lake of Geneva, namely, that produced by his clear apprehension of the
          exact nature of a certain calumny which had been for some time in circulation in England,
          and also of the wide-spread belief in it. This was the same story which Mrs. Beecher Stowe
          in the sixties published to the world, as having been confidentially communicated to
          herself by Lady Byron, »whilst a heavenly brightness shone from that lady's ethereal
          countenance«–the story of the criminal relations between Lord Byron and his step-sister,
          Augusta Leigh. The assurance that such relations had existed became in course of time so
          firmly rooted in Lady Byron's mind that (as is proved by a work entitled <emph>Medora Leigh</emph>,
          published in 1869) she did not even shrink from telling Augusta's daughter, Medora, who
          applied to her for assistance when in difficulties, that she was not a daughter of Colonel
          Leigh, but of Lord Byron. Lady Byron at the same time promised Medora that she would
          always provide for her maintenance–a promise she did not keep.</p>

        <p>At the time he left England, Byron had evidently known nothing, or as good as nothing, of
          this report. He had probably not read all the hostile newspaper articles. He himself
          writes that it was not till some time afterwards that he heard of all his enemies had done
          and said; and he blames his friends for having concealed various things from him. It was
          while he was in Switzerland that he learned everything. Knowing this, we understand the
          full meaning of the poetry addressed at that time to Augusta. In the Third Canto of
          <emph>Childe Harold</emph> we find the following stanza:–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»And there was one soft breast, as hath been said,</l>
          <l>Which unto his was bound by stronger ties</l>
          <l>Than the Church links withal; and, though unwed,</l>
          <l><emph>That</emph> love was pure, and, far above disguise,</l>
          <l>Had stood the test of mortal enmities</l>
          <l>Still undivided, and cemented more</l>
          <l>By peril, dreaded most in female eyes;</l>
          <l>But this was firm, and from a foreign shore</l>
          <l>Well to that heart might his these absent greetings pour!«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>The <emph>Stanzas to Augusta</emph> express similar sentiments; and the line, »Though slander'd,
          thou never couldst shake« <pb n="305"/> (in the second of the poems to her), shows that she, too knew of
          the shameful rumours.</p>

        <p>And now we also have the explanation of the sudden revulsion which occurred in
          Switzerland in Byron's feeling towards Lady Byron. In the days immediately following the
          separation he had written: »I do not believe that there ever was a better, or even a
          brighter, a kinder, or a more amiable and agreeable being than Lady B.,« and had laid the
          blame of everything on his own violence and inconsiderateness; but now he sees only the
          blemishes in her character; and it is while under the overpowering impression made by the
          accusation just alluded to, that he begins the ugly war upon a woman, which, if we did not
          know the circumstances, would seem utterly inexcusable, and draws the unflattering
          portrait of his wife as Donna Inez in the First Canto of <emph>Don Juan</emph>.</p>

        <p>Decisive, and positively crushing, evidence against Lady Byron was produced in 1869, in
          the <emph>Quarterly Review</emph>. Seven letters and notes were printed, written after the separation
          by her to Mrs. Leigh, all brimming over with tenderness and assurances of affection. It is
          her »great comfort« that Mrs. Leigh is with Lord Byron. »Shall I still be your sister? I
          must resign my rights to be so considered; but I don't think that will make any difference
          in the kindness I have so uniformly experienced from you.« »In this at least I am 'truth
          itself' when I say that whatsoever the situation may be, there is no one whose society is
          dearer to me, or can contribute more to my happiness. These feelings will not change under
          any circumstances.... Should you hereafter condemn me, I shall not love you the less.«
          Thus did Lady Byron write to the woman whom, after the lapse of many years, she accused as
          the guilty person who had driven her from her husband's house. This friendly
          correspondence between Lady Byron and Mrs. Leigh actually continues till Byron's death.
          His last unfinished letter begins with the words: »My dearest Augusta, I received a few
          days ago your and Lady Byron's report of Ada's health.« And yet we are asked to believe
          that Lady Byron the whole time regarded Augusta, who continued to be the reconciling <pb n="306"/> intermediary between the spouses, as the unnatural criminal who was one of the authors of
          the misfortune of her life. What a chaos of lies and insanity!</p>

        <p>Insanity is the right word, for, as the <emph>Quarterly Review</emph> has remarked, »Lady Byron
          could at first account for her gifted husband's conduct on no hypothesis but insanity; and
          now, by a sort of Nemesis, there is no other hypothesis on which the charitable moralist
          can account for hers. But there is this marked difference in their maladies: he morbidly
          exaggerated his vices, and she her virtues; his monomania lay in being an impossible
          sinner, and hers in being an impossible saint ... He in his mad moods did his best to
          blacken his own reputation, whilst her self-delusions invariably tended to damage the
          characters of all that were nearest and should have been dearest to her. Which was the
          more dangerous or less amiable delusion of the two?«<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom"><emph>Quarterly Review</emph>, October 1869. Compare with Karl Elze's admirable work: <emph>Lord
            Byron</emph>, p. 179.</note></p>

        <p>The last impression received by Byron in Switzerland was, then, the crushing one of this
          slander. His thoughts revolved round the story, and the artist in him was ever more
          fascinated by it. George Sand, in a letter to Sainte-Beuve, has, with a few rapid touches,
          described her nature, and the nature of the poet generally. She is writing about Jouffroy
          the philosopher, who has expressed a desire to be introduced to her, but of whom, as an
          extremely rigorous and unimaginative moralist, she is a little afraid. She remarks: »I
          have once or twice said to myself: Might it not be permissible to eat human flesh? You
          have said to yourself: People doubtless exist who think that it might be permissible to
          eat human flesh! Jouffroy has said to himself: Such an idea never occurred to any one,
          &amp;c.«–a clever definition of the nature of the poet as compared with that of the
          observer and the moralist.</p>

        <p>Byron was one of those who permit their imaginative and their reflective powers every
          possible experiment; he had a strong inclination to brood over, and let his fancy <pb n="307"/> play
          with, what people in general fear and avoid. The well-known anecdote (which aroused such
          horror) of his exclaiming, with a knife in his hand: »I wish I knew what it feels like to
          have committed a murder,« means this and nothing more. There was the same fascination for
          him in thinking and working himself into the feeling of guilt which accompanies a criminal
          attachment, as there was in imagining the feelings which accompany a murder. His earliest
          heroes, such as the Giaour and Lara, have committed a mysterious murder; and, as is well
          known, Byron was promptly credited with the crime of his heroes. Even the aged Goethe
          allowed himself to be so far led astray by the gossip that reached his ears as to
          characterise (in his review of <emph>Manfred</emph>) as »extremely probable« the foolish tale of
          Byron's doings in Florence–where, as a matter of fact, he spent one afternoon. The story
          reported him to have had an intrigue there with a young married woman, who was, in
          consequence, killed by her husband–the husband in his turn being killed by Byron. Just as
          the public of that day saw evidence of Byron's murderous deeds in Lara's tragic mien, the
          public of our day have seen evidence of his incest in Manfred's despair and Cain's
          marriage with his sister. It is not surprising that Byron and Moore should have meditated
          writing an imaginary biography of Lord Byron, in which he was to seduce so many members of
          the one sex and murder so many of the other, that the scandal-mongers would be outbid and
          possibly silenced. The project was only relinquished from fear that the public might take
          the jest as sober earnest.</p>

        <p>It is probable that the subject of love between brother and sister was one often
          discussed by Shelley and Byron in the course of their conversations, all the more probable
          from the circumstance that the younger poet's mind was also exercised by the unprofitable
          question. What incensed Byron more than anything else was the pious horror displayed by
          the orthodox Bible Christians, one article of whose faith it is that the human race, as
          descended from one man and woman, multiplied by means of marriage between brother and
          sister. Hence he lays emphasis in <emph>Cain</emph> on <pb n="308"/> the circumstance that Cain and Adah are
          brother and sister, and makes Lucifer explain to Adah that <emph>her</emph> love for her brother is
          not a sin, though the same passion in her descendants will be; to which Adah very
          logically replies:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»What is the sin which is not</l>
          <l>Sin in itself? Can circumstance make sin</l>
          <l>Or virtue?«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p><emph>Manfred</emph> and <emph>Cain</emph> were the products of all the psychological elements which have now
          been indicated. <emph>Manfred</emph> is the less important of the two works. It does not bear the
          comparison with Goethe's <emph>Faust</emph> which it invites and which has been so often instituted.
          Goethe himself said that an interesting lecture might be given on the subject. They have
          since been given in abundance; there is more originality and talent in Taine's than in any
          other known to me.</p>

        <p>At only one point does <emph>Manfred</emph> rise superior to <emph>Faust</emph>. To the critic there is no
          surer criterion of the value of the different parts of a work than the circumstance that,
          after a certain length of time, he remembers this or that part and has forgotten the rest.
          I know with certainty that, a year after I had read <emph>Manfred</emph>, all that I remembered of it
          was the scene in which, in the hour of his death, the hero, who has judged himself so
          severely, first repulses the Abbot and such comfort as he would fain give, and then with
          proud contempt dismisses from his presence the evil spirits with whom he has nothing in
          common, and to whom he has never given the slightest power over him. The difference
          between this man and Faust, who sells himself to Mephistopheles and falls on his knees
          before the Earth Spirit, is very striking. The English poet has had before his eyes a
          higher ideal of independent manhood than has the German; Byron's hero is a typical man,
          Goethe's a typical human being. Alone in death as in life, Manfred has no more communion
          with hell than he has with heaven. He is his own accuser and his own judge. This is
          Byron's manly ethical standpoint. Not till he reaches the lonely heights above the
          snow-line, where human weakness and pliability <pb n="309"/> do not thrive, does his soul breathe
          freely. And the Alpine landscape is the natural, inevitable background for his hero whose
          stern wildness is akin to such scenes.</p>

        <p>But in <emph>Manfred</emph> only the egoistic side of Byron's nature reveals itself. His wide human
          sympathies find full expression for the first time in <emph>Cain</emph>. <emph>Cain</emph> is Byron's confession
          of faith–that is to say, the confession of all his doubts and all his criticism. When we
          remember that he had neither, like Shelley and the great poets of Germany, attained by
          dint of thought to an emancipated, humanistic view of the world and life, nor, like the
          authors of our own days, had the advantage of being able to base his ideas and imaginings
          on the subject of the beliefs of the past and the present upon a groundwork of facts
          established by natural science and scientific Biblical criticism, we cannot but marvel at
          the intellectual power and earnestness which he in this work brings to bear on the most
          vital problems of life.</p>

        <p>As a private personage Byron was, undoubtedly, as much of the dilettante in his
          free-thought as in his politics. His admirable reasoning power revolted against belief in
          what was contrary to reason; but, like most of the great men at the beginning of the
          century–that is to say, before the remarkable development of religion and science which
          has taken place during its progress–he was sceptical and superstitious at one and the
          same time. As a child, religion had been made a weariness to him; his mother dragged him
          regularly to church, and he revenged himself when he was bored beyond all measure by
          pricking her with a pin. As a youth, he was roused to revolt by the rigid literal beliefs
          of the Church of England, as contained in its thirty-nine Articles; he wrote in his
          memorandum-book: »It is useless to tell me <emph>not</emph> to <emph>reason</emph>, but to <emph>believe</emph>. You might
          as well tell a man not to wake, but <emph>sleep</emph>.« The belief in eternal hell-fire was a
          subject of eternal merriment with him. He writes to Moore in 1822: »Do you remember
          Frederick the Great's answer to the remonstrance of the villagers whose curate preached
          against the eternity of hell's torments? It was thus:–'If my faithful subjects of
          Schrausen<pb n="310"/>haussen prefer being eternally damned, let them.'« And he horrified his
          fellow-countrymen by writing in <emph>Don Juan</emph>:</p>

        <p>He disliked the clergy. Trelawny reports him to have said: »When did parsons patronise
          genius? If one of their black band dares to think for himself, he is drummed out or cast
          aside, like Sterne and Swift«; and Moore gives as one of his ejaculations: »These rascals
          of priests have done more harm to religion than all the unbelievers.« But, in spite of all
          his jests and jeers, his feeling was one of uncertainty. He dared not endorse the
          conclusions to which Shelley was led by his reflections; and he sent his little daughter
          to be educated in a convent, to withdraw her from the influence of the sceptical talk of
          Shelley and his wife. A beautiful and very characteristic letter from Shelley gives
          decisive evidence on the subject of Byron's uncertainty. »Lord Byron,« he writes, »has
          read me one or two letters of Moore to him, in which Moore speaks with great kindness of
          me; and of course I cannot but feel flattered by the approbation of a man, my inferiority
          to whom I am proud to acknowledge(!) Amongst other things, however, Moore seems to
          deprecate my influence on Lord Byron's mind on the subject of religion, and to attribute
          the tone assumed in <emph>Cain</emph> to my suggestion.... I think you know Moore. Pray assure him
          that I have not the smallest influence over Lord Byron in this particular; if I had, I
          certainly should employ it to eradicate from his great mind the delusions of Christianity,
          which, in spite of his reason, seem perpetually to recur, and <pb n="311"/> to lie in ambush for the
          hours of sickness and distress. <emph>Cain</emph> was <emph>conceived</emph> many years ago, and begun before I
          saw him last year at Ravenna. How happy should I not be to attribute to myself, however
          indirectly, any participation in that immortal work!«</p>

        <p>Thus we see that Byron, the private individual, had by no means arrived at any definite
          conclusions on the great subjects which engage the mind of man. And we are consequently
          all the more impressed by the manner in which, in his poetry, his genius takes possession
          of him, and makes him great and victorious in his argument, directing his aim with
          absolute certainty to the vital points. In European literature, which in 1821 lay stifling
          in the clutches of orthodoxy, there was a perfect revolution when <emph>Cain</emph> appeared, like a
          herald of revolt; the only comparison possible is with the impression produced in the
          scientific world fourteen years later by Strauss's <emph>Life of Jesus</emph>. The great German poets
          had, in their liberal Hellenism, left the orthodox belief untouched. This less emancipated
          poet was confined in the cage of dogma, but was uneasily pacing round and round in it like
          an imprisoned wild animal, shaking at its bars.</p>

        <p><emph>Cain</emph> is not written with the haste of inspiration–is not a work that storms and
          thunders. In it Byron has succeeded in accomplishing what for passionate natures is the
          most difficult of all tasks–the accomplishment of which is, indeed, the supreme triumph
          of morality–he has <emph>canalised</emph> his passion, that is to say, caused its wild currents to
          fertilise. The play is a product of reflection–of the thought that burrows and mines, the
          acuteness that splits, the reasoning power that shivers. Here more than anywhere else is
          what Goethe makes Byron say of himself (as Euphorion in the Second Part of <emph>Faust</emph>)
          applicable–namely, that he has a distaste for what is easily won, and delights only in
          what he takes by force. But the whole hammering, crushing, intellectual machinery, which
          to all appearance works under such complete control, is set in movement by an enkindled,
          glowing imagination; and at the very centre of everything there is a panting, sobbing
          heart. Byron's faith helped him as much as did his scepticism. With perfect simplicity he
          takes the <pb n="312"/> Old Testament story as he finds it. He treats its characters, not as symbolic
          figures, but as realities; and he does it in all sincerity–his scepticism attacks
          traditions; it accepts tradition. Besides, was he not himself, both in his intellect and
          his emotions, a man of the Old Testament type? In his soul resounded lamentations like
          those of Job when he was comforted and reproved by his friends, and cries for vengeance
          like those in the Psalms. The <emph>Hebrew Melodies</emph> prove how naturally the Jewish garment
          accommodated itself to the forms of his feeling.</p>

        <p>In all sincerity, then, Byron for the time being acknowledges the claims of tradition and
          bows the neck of his reason to its yoke; but in <emph>Cain</emph> we see human reason writhing under
          this yoke, rebelling against it–tortured by its pricks and kicking against them. And what
          lends special attraction to the spectacle is, that the human reason in this case is a
          young, newborn one. On the true poet the rising of the sun makes as powerful an impression
          as if he were beholding it rise on the first day of creation; to Byron, all doubts and
          questions were so fresh that they could be put into the mouth of the first questioner and
          doubter. The formation of the doubts and complaints had demanded nothing less than the
          whole long succession of the human generations who had sighed and groaned over the cruelty
          of life and the irrationality of tradition. But although they are the accumulated woes of
          many thousand years–the ever increasing sufferings of thousands of generations of free
          human spirits in the torture-chambers of orthodoxy–which are here voiced by the first
          rebel, he expresses it all with as much originality and simplicity as if the thought-task
          of millions had at once been accomplished by the first thinking brain. This is the first
          of those contradictions in the poem which are so effective.</p>

        <p>The part of the drama in which all the discrepancies in the Jewish-Christian tradition
          are laid bare, and its incompatibility as a whole with reason is proved–the veiled attack
          on orthodoxy, in short–possesses tolerably little interest for us nowadays; the human
          race has progressed so far since 1821 that all the subtlety displayed in refuting the
          theology of the Book of Genesis affects us much in the same <pb n="313"/> manner as a disputation on the
          belief in werewolves. Nor are these attacks intended to be taken literally; Byron had, of
          course, no intention of writing blasphemously, of scoffing at a being whom he himself
          regarded as the supreme, the all-embracing being. What Cain combats is in reality only the
          belief that the order of nature is a moral order and that goodness, instead of being one
          of the aims of human life, is its postulate. It must be remembered that the language of
          human beings is full of words which were formed in ages past, and which we are obliged to
          use because the language owns no others, but the interpretation of which has changed many
          times in the course of centuries. Such words are, for example, soul and body, eternity,
          salvation, Paradise, the first temptation, the first curse. Byron has retained in his poem
          all the expressions of the Book of Genesis. The second suggestive contradiction in the
          drama is, therefore, the constant inward disagreement between the spirit of the poem and
          its letter. This second contradiction thoroughly arouses the readers who have been
          startled by the first.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Renan writes on this subject: »Supposez même que, pour nous philosophes, un autre mot

        <p>Side by side in this drama with the exposure of the hollowness of the general orthodox
          belief in God, we have a passionate representation of the infinite misery of human
          existence. To what underlies this, the empty, unmeaning name of <emph>pessimism</emph> has been
          given; the true definition is, a profound compassion for the undeniable sufferings of
          humanity. Far deeper down in Byron's soul than wrath with the power which creates only to
          destroy, lies the feeling of the obligatory sympathy of all with all–sympathy with all
          the <pb n="314"/> suffering which it is impossible to relieve, but equally impossible not to be
          conscious of. <emph>Cain</emph> is a tragedy dealing with the source of all tragedy–the fact that
          man is born, suffers, sins, and dies.</p>

        <p>Byron revolves in his mind the Bible legend: Adam has been tamed; Eve has been cowed;
          Abel is a gentle, submissive boy; Cain is young humanity–pondering, questioning,
          desiring, demanding. He is to take part in the general thanksgiving. Praise and give
          thanks for what? For life? Am I not to die? For life? Did I ask to live? Am I still in the
          garden of Eden? Why should I suffer? For Adam's transgression?</p>

          <l>»What had <emph>I</emph> done in this?–I was unborn:</l>
          <l>I sought not to be born; nor love the state</l>
          <l>To which that birth has brought me. Why did he</l>
          <l>Yield to the serpent and the woman? or,</l>
          <l>Yielding, why suffer? What was there in this?</l>
          <l>The tree was planted, and why not for him?</l>
          <l>If not, why place him near it, where it grew,</l>
          <l>The fairest in the centre? They have but</l>
          <l>One answer to all questions: 'Twas <emph>his</emph> will,</l>
          <l>And <emph>he</emph> is good.' How know I that?</l>
          <l>Because He is all-powerful, must all-good, too, follow?«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>Goodness would not create evil, and what hath He created but evil? And even supposing
          evil leads to good?–why not create good at once? He has »multiplied himself in misery,«
          and yet He is happy. Who could be happy alone, happy in being the only happy one? And that
          is what He is–the »indefinite, indissoluble tyrant.«</p>

        <p>We are nothing in His sight. »Well,« says Cain, »if I am nothing, for nothing shall I be
          an hypocrite, and seem well-pleased with pain?« War of all with all, and death for all,
          and disease for nearly all, and suffering, and bitterness; these were the fruits of the
          forbidden tree. Is not man's lot a miserable one? One good gift the fatal apple has
          given–reason. But who could be proud of a mind which is chained to an enslaving body, »to
          the most gross and petty paltry wants, all foul and fulsome, the very best of its
          enjoyments a sweet degradation, a most enervating and filthy <pb n="315"/> cheat!« Not Paradise, but
          death, is our inheritance on this wretched little earth, the abode of beings »whose
          enjoyment was to be in blindness–a Paradise of Ignorance, from which knowledge was barred
          as poison.« And oh! the thought that all this misery is to be propagated and
          inherited!–to see the first tears shed and shudderingly anticipate the oceans that will
          flow! Would it not be better to snatch the infant in his sleep and dash him against the
          rocks, and thus choke the spring of misery at its source? Were it not infinitely better
          that the child had never been born? How dare any one bring children into such a world? And
          this is the existence for which I am to offer thanks and praise!</p>

        <p>Such is Cain's mood at the moment when he is compelled to offer sacrifice; and it is
          largely due to the suggestions of Lucifer. For Lucifer prefers torment to »the smooth
          agonies of adulation, in hymns and harpings, and self-seeking prayers.« This Lucifer is no
          devil. He says himself:</p>

        <l><cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»<emph>Who</emph> covets evil</l>
          <l>For its own bitter sake?–<emph>None</emph>–nothing! 'tis</l>
          <l>The leaven of all life, and lifelessness.«</l></lg></quote></cit></l>

        <p>Nor is he a Mephistopheles. Except for one faint jest, he is severely earnest. No! this
          Lucifer is really the bringer of light, the genius of science, the proud and defiant
          spirit of criticism, the best friend of man, overthrown because he would not cringe or
          lie, but inflexible, because, like his enemy, he is eternal. He is the spirit of freedom.
          But it is significant that what he represents is not the frank, open, struggle for
          liberty, but the feeling which inspires gloomy conspirators, who seek their aim by
          forbidden ways–the feeling which prevailed among the despairing young friends of liberty
          in Europe in the year 1821.</p>

        <p>In his work, <emph>Justice in the Revolution and the Church</emph>, Proudhon, addressing the
          Archbishop of Besançon, exclaims: »Liberty is your Antichrist. Come, then, O Satan! thou
          maligned of priests and kings, let me embrace thee, let me clasp thee to my heart! Thy
          works, thou blessed one, are not always fair and good, but they alone give meaning to <pb n="316"/> the
          universe. What would justice be without thee? An instinct. Reason? A habit. Man? An
          animal.« Satan, thus understood, is simply the spirit of free criticism; and if Byron's
          poetry had been named »Satanic« after him, it might have borne the name without shame.</p>

        <p>With the assistance of Lucifer, part of the action of <emph>Cain</emph> takes place in the region of
          the supernatural; for that spirit conveys his pupil through the abyss of space, shows him
          all the worlds with their inhabitants, the realms of death, and, through the mist of the
          future, the generations yet unborn. He demands from Cain neither blind faith nor blind
          submission. He does not say: »Believe–and sink not! Doubt–and perish!« He does not make
          belief in him the condition of Cain's salvation; he requires neither homage nor gratitude;
          he opens Cain's eyes.</p>

        <p>Cain returns to earth; and the first rebel leaves the first murderer alone, a prey to his
          consuming doubt. Sacrifices are to be offered, and he has to choose an altar. What are
          altars to him? So much turf and stone. Abhorring suffering, he will not slaughter innocent
          animals in honour of a bloodthirsty God; on his altar he lays the fruits of the earth.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Here the influence of Shelley is apparent.</note>
          Abel prays in correctly pious fashion. Cain, too, must pray. What shall he say?</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»If thou must be induced with altars</l>
          <l>And softened with a sacrifice, receive them!</l>
          <l>…</l>
          <l>If thou lov'st blood, the shepherd's shrine, which smokes</l>
          <l>On my right hand, hath shed it for thy service;</l>
          <l>… If a shrine without victim,</l>
          <l>An altar without gore, may win thy favour,</l>
          <l>Look on it! and for him who dresseth it,</l>
          <l>He is–such as thou mad'st him; and seeks nothing</l>
          <l>Which must be won by kneeling.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>Fire comes down from heaven and consumes Abel's sacrifice, the flames greedily licking up
          the blood on the altar. But a whirlwind throws down Cain's altar and scatters the fruits
          upon the earth. Did God, then, rejoice in the pain of the bleating mothers when their
          lambs were <pb n="317"/> taken from them to be slaughtered? and in »the pangs of the sad ignorant
          victims under the pious knife«? Cain's blood boils; he begins to demolish the offending
          altar. Abel opposes him. »Beware!« cries Cain; »thy God loves blood!« And, driven by his
          wrath, his misery, his fate, into the snare spread for him by the Lord, he commits the
          first murder, without knowing what it means to kill, and thus himself brings death to his
          kind–death, the very name of which, when the future of humanity was revealed to him, had
          filled him with horror. The deed is repented of before it is done; for Cain, who loves all
          men, is tenderly attached to Abel. There follow, nevertheless, the curse, the sentence,
          the banishment, and the mark of Cain.</p>

        <p>This mark of Cain is the mark of humanity–the sign of suffering and immortality. Byron's
          drama represents the struggle between suffering, searching, striving humanity and that God
          of hosts, of lightnings, and of storms, whose weakened arms are forced to let go a world
          which is writhing itself free from his embrace. To exterminate this world which denies
          him, he causes rivers of blood to flow, and hundreds of martyr fires to be kindled by his
          priests; but Cain rises unscathed from the ashes of the fire, and flagellates the priests
          with undying scorn. Cain is thinking humanity, which with its thought cleaves the old
          »firmament of heaven,« and beholds millions of spheres rolling in freedom, high above
          Jehovah's rattling thunder-chariot. Cain is working humanity, which is striving in the
          sweat of its brow to produce a new and better Eden–not the Eden of ignorance, but an Eden
          of knowledge and harmony; a humanity which, long after Jehovah has been sewn into His
          shroud, will be alive, pressing to its breast Abel, who has been restored from the
          dead.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">Compare Leconte de Lisle: <emph>Poèmes barbares. Kain</emph>.</note></p>

        <p><emph>Cain</emph> was dedicated to Sir Walter Scott, who gave it as his opinion that Byron's Muse
          had never before taken so lofty a flight, and who answered in advance the attacks that
          were likely to be made on the author. But this did not prevent the appearance of the work
          being regarded and lamented as a positive national calamity. Before it went to <pb n="318"/> press,
          Murray was anxious that Byron should make some alterations. But Byron wrote: »The two
          passages cannot be altered without making Lucifer talk like the Bishop of Lincoln, which
          would not be in the character of the former.« Immediately after publication the play was
          pirated, and Murray applied to Lord Eldon for an injunction to protect his property in the
          work. The Lord Chancellor refused it in terms which may be epitomised thus: »This court,
          like the other courts of justice in this country, acknowledges Christianity as part of the
          law of the land. Its jurisdiction in protecting literary property is founded on this. The
          publication in question being intended to bring into discredit that portion of Scripture
          history to which it relates, no damages can be recovered in respect of a piracy of it.«
          Thus <emph>Cain</emph>–like Southey's <emph>Wat Tyler</emph>–was regarded as such a criminal work that the law
          refused even to vindicate the right of property in it.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, Moore was writing to Byron: »<emph>Cain</emph> is wonderful, terrible, never to be
          forgotten. If I am not mistaken, it will sink deep into the world's heart.« History has
          endorsed this verdict.</p>

        <p>When, in the autumn of 1816, Switzerland began to be overrun by crowds of English
          tourists, residence there became intolerable to Lord Byron, and he betook himself with Mr.
          Hobhouse, the travelling companion of his youth, to Italy. At Milan he met Beyle, one of
          the most acute of observers; and it is a strong proof of the extraordinary impression
          produced by the poet's personality, that he captivated even this man, who was always on
          his guard against being led into hasty enthusiasms, and who quickly detected what was
          assumed in Byron's manner. Beyle writes: »Ce fut pendant l'automne de 1816, que je le
          rencontrai au théâtre de la <emph>Scala</emph>, à Milan, dans la loge de M. Louis de Brême. Je fus
          frappé des yeux de Lord Byron au moment où il écoutait un sestetto d'un opéra de Mayer
          intitulé <emph>Elena</emph>. Je n'ai vu de ma vie rien de plus beau ni de plus expressif. Encore
          aujourd'hui, si je viens à penser à l'expression qu'un grand peintre devrait donner au
          génie, cette tête sublime reparaît tout-à-coup devant moi. J'eus un instant
          d'enthousiasme.... Je n'oublierai jamais l'expression divine de ses traits; c'était l'air
          serein de la puissance et du génie.«</p>

        <p>From Milan Byron proceeded to Venice, the city which he preferred to all others, and
          which he has celebrated in the Fourth Canto of <emph>Childe Harold</emph>, in <emph>Marino Faliero</emph>, in
          <emph>The Two Foscari</emph>, in the <emph>Ode to Venice</emph>, and in <emph>Beppo</emph>, which last work was written in
          Venice. Never had he been overcome by such deep depression as now; never had forgetfulness
          been so desirable. The enchanting climate and air of Italy acted on him like a charm. He
          was twenty-nine. With its <pb n="320"/> beautiful women, its loose morals, and all its southern manners
          and customs, Venice invited to a wild revel of the senses. An ardent longing for happiness
          and enjoyment was part of Byron's nature; and it is also to be remembered that his defiant
          temper had been thoroughly roused. He had been stigmatised as capable of every enormity;
          he might just as well, for once, give his countrymen abroad something real to write home
          about, and the old women at home real cause to swoon; they wrote and they swooned whatever
          his behaviour was.</p>

        <p>His first proceedings in Venice were to engage a gondola and gondolier, a box at the
          theatre, and a mistress. The last was easily found. He had taken apartments in the house
          of a merchant, whose wife, Marianna Segati, then aged twenty-two, he describes as having
          large, black, Oriental eyes and being in »appearance altogether like an antelope.« She and
          Byron became so enamoured of each other, that Byron allowed Hobhouse to go on alone to
          Rome. »I should have gone too,« he writes, »but I fell in love, and must stay that over.«
          The young beauty compelled him to join, in her company, in all the distractions of the
          Carnival. He devoted his nights, like the born Venetian, to pleasure; but in his fear of
          becoming stout, he adhered to his usual extremely sparing diet, ate only vegetables and
          fruit, and was obliged to drink large quantities of his favourite beverage, rum and water,
          to keep up his strength. For he was completing <emph>Manfred</emph> at this time. We receive a sad
          impression of the aimlessness of his life when we read that, to counterbalance all the
          distractions, to give his days a centre of gravity, he spent several hours of each at the
          Armenian monastery of San Lazaro, learning Armenian from the monks. The mornings were
          devoted to this, the afternoons to physical exercise, chiefly riding. He had his horses
          brought to Venice, and with Shelley and other friends used to cross over to the Lido and
          ride there.</p>

        <p>We have a reminiscence of the talk during these rides in Shelley's <emph>Julian and Maddalo</emph>.
          At sunset he and Byron see on one of the islands a dreary, windowless pile, rising in dark
          relief against the flaming sky behind it. They hear, <pb n="321"/> clanging from the open tower on the
          top of the house, the iron tongue of a bell. Said Byron:–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»What we behold</l>
          <l>Shall be the madhouse and its belfry tower,</l>
          <l>… and ever at this hour</l>
          <l>Those who may cross the water, hear that bell</l>
          <l>Which calls the maniacs, each one from his cell</l>
          <l>To vespers. …</l>
          <l>And like that black and dreary bell, the soul</l>
          <l>Hung in a heaven-illumined tower, must toll</l>
          <l>Our thoughts and our desires to meet below</l>
          <l>Round the rent heart and pray–as madmen do</l>
          <l>For what–they know not.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>No better image of Byron's own life at this period could be desired. Most assuredly at
          this time his longings and desires were like maniacs, all gathered together only once a
          day by the bell of the madhouse.</p>

        <p>It was with difficulty, after being ill with a sharp fever, contracted in the unhealthy
          air of Venice, that he tore himself away from Marianna Segati long enough to pay a short
          visit to Ferrara and Rome. After his return, however, his violent passion for her
          subsided, as he began to discover that she sold the jewellery he gave her, and made as
          much profit generally as she could, out of her position as his mistress. During the first
          part of his stay in Venice, Byron had mixed much in the refined society which had its
          chief meeting-place at the house of the cultivated, literary Countess Albrizzi; now he
          withdrew himself entirely from its restraining influence. He rented for himself and his
          menagerie a magnificent palace on the Grand Canal. This palace soon became a harem, in
          which the favourite sultana was a beautiful young woman of the lower orders, Margarita
          Cogni, who, from the circumstance of her husband being a baker, was called Byron's
          Fornarina. Her face was of »the fine Venetian cast of the old time«; her figure, though
          she was perhaps rather tall, was also fine, and exactly suited the national dress. She had
          all the naïveté and droll humour of the Venetian lower classes, and, as she could neither
          read nor write, she could not plague Byron with letters. She was jealous; she snatched off
          the masks of <pb n="322"/> ladies whom she found in Byron's company, and she sought his presence
          whenever it suited her, with no great regard to time, place, or persons. He writes: »When
          I first knew her, I was in 'relazione' with la Signora, who was silly enough one evening
          at Dolo, accompanied by some of her female friends, to threaten her.... Margarita threw
          back her veil (fazziolo), and replied in very explicit Venetian, '<emph>You</emph> are <emph>not</emph> his
          <emph>wife</emph>. <emph>I</emph> am <emph>not</emph> his <emph>wife</emph>: you are his Donna, and <emph>I</emph> am his <emph>Donna</emph>: your husband
          is a <emph>becco</emph>, and mine is another. For the rest, what <emph>right</emph> have you to reproach me? If
          he prefers me to you, is it my fault?' Having delivered this pretty piece of eloquence,
          she went on her way, leaving a numerous audience with Madame –– to ponder at her leisure
          on the dialogue between them.« In time Margarita established herself as housekeeper in
          Byron's house, reduced the expenses of the establishment to less than half, marched about
          in a gown with a train, and wore a hat with feathers (articles of dress which had been the
          height of her ambition), beat the maids, opened Byron's letters, and actually studied her
          alphabet in order to be able to detect which of them were from ladies. In her wild way she
          loved him; her joy at seeing him return safe from a sail in which his boat had been caught
          in a storm, was that of a tigress over her returned cubs. Her ungovernableness increased
          to such an extent that Byron was obliged to tell her that she must return home. After
          trying to attack him with a knife, she threw herself in her anger and despair into the
          canal. She was rescued and sent home, and Byron wrote her story at full length to Murray;
          he knew that his letters to his publisher were passed from hand to hand like public
          documents; and half the pleasure of his excesses consisted in the certainty of their
          creating a scandal in England.</p>

        <p>From the letter just quoted it is easy to see that the dissolute Venetian life did not
          absorb him heart and soul; he quite saw the comic side of it all. And it was actually of
          service in furthering his development as a thinker and a poet. His friends at home were in
          despair at the way in which he was compromising his dignity and his reputation; but this
          wild, jovial, Carnival life, lived amongst the women of the <pb n="323"/> people under the bright
          Italian skies, was producing a new, realistic style in his poetry. In the works of his
          youth he had, sadly, and with a heart wrung with anguish, described the ebb-tide of life;
          in <emph>Beppo</emph> the spring-tide suddenly began to rise. <emph>Beppo</emph> was real life, in a setting of
          laughter and jest. In Byron's youthful pathos there had been a certain monotony, along
          with a good deal of artificiality. In this work his genius, as it were, sloughed its skin;
          the monotony was broken by a constant change of theme and key, the artificiality was
          dispelled by hearty laughter. In his youthful satire there had been a good deal of
          snappishness and a decided lack of grace and humour. Now that his own life had for a short
          time assumed the character of a Carnival play, the Graces, of their own accord, came
          tripping and twining through his verses, keeping time to the tinkling of the bells of
          humour.</p>

        <p><emph>Beppo</emph> is the »Carnival of Venice« itself–that old theme which Byron, like another
          Paganini, found upon his way, lifted on the point of his divine bow, and proceeded to
          adorn with a multitude of daring and ingenious variations, with a luxurious embroidery of
          pearls and golden arabesques. There had come into his hands an English comic poem on the
          subject of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, in which the Honourable John
          Hookham Frere had imitated the first poem written in the <emph>ottava rima</emph> (Berni's paraphrase
          of <emph>Orlando Furioso</emph>). The reading of Frere's work aroused in Byron the desire to attempt
          something in the same style, and the result was <emph>Beppo</emph>, the complete originality of which
          effaced every recollection of a model. Now he had found the form which suited his purpose,
          the weapon which he could wield with the most effect–the <emph>ottava rima</emph>, with its sextett
          of alternate rhymes, to the solid mass of which the concluding rhymed couplet adds now a
          jest, now a key, now a stylistic antic, now a stinging wit-dart.</p>

        <p>And what is the poem about? About just as little as Alfred de Musset's <emph>Namouna</emph>, or
          Paludan-Müller's <emph>Danserinden</emph>, which were written in much the same style sixteen years
          later (1833). The story in itself is nothing: A Venetian goes to sea, and stays so long
          away that his wife makes sure he is dead. She has long been as good as married to another <pb n="324"/> man, when he suddenly turns up again. He has been sold as a Turkish slave, and, on his
          return, dressed as a Turk, he finds his wife at a masked ball, on the arm of the Count who
          has now for several years filled his place. When the couple, returning from the ball, step
          out of their gondola, they find the husband standing at the door of his own house. As soon
          as all three have recovered a little from the first surprise, they call for three cups of
          coffee, and conversation begins in the following style, Laura speaking:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Beppo! what's your pagan name?</l>
          <l>Bless me! your beard is of amazing growth!</l>
          <l>And how came you to keep away so long?</l>
          <l>Are you not sensible 'twas very wrong?</l></lg>

        <lg>
          <l><!-- slettet »; blot markering af fortsat citat -->And are you <emph>really, truly</emph>, now a Turk?</l>

          <l>Well, that's the prettiest shawl!–as I'm alive!</l>
          <l>You'll give it me! They say you eat no pork,« &amp;c. &amp;c.</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>This is all the explanation the husband receives, or asks. As he cannot go about dressed
          as a Turk, he borrows a pair of trousers from Laura's <emph>cavaliere servente</emph>, the Count, and
          the story ends in perfect amicability on all sides. In itself it is of little importance,
          but it was Byron's study for his masterpiece, <emph>Don Juan</emph>–the only one of his works which,
          as it were, contains the whole wide ocean of life, with its storms and its sunshine, its
          ebb and its flood.</p>

        <p>Byron's friends tried every means in their power to induce him to return to England, in
          the hope of thereby reclaiming him from the life he was leading. But instead of returning
          he sold Newstead Abbey, which in his youth he had vowed he would never part with
          (receiving £94,000 for it). Indeed, so strong was his antipathy to the thought of return,
          that he could not even bear the idea of being taken back as a corpse. »I trust,« he
          writes, »they won't think of 'pickling, and bringing me home to Clod or Blunderbuss Hall.'
          I am sure my bones would not rest in an English grave, or my clay mix with the earth of
          that country. I believe the thought would drive me mad on my deathbed, <pb n="325"/> could I suppose
          that any of my friends would be base enough to convey my carcass back to your soil. I
          would not even feed your worms, if I could help it.«</p>

        <p>But now occurred an event which in an unforeseen manner put an end to the polygamy in
          which Byron was living in Venice–an event that constituted a turning-point in his life.
          In April 1819, he was presented to Countess Teresa Guiccioli, daughter of Count Gamba of
          Ravenna, a lady who was at this time only sixteen, and had just been married to Count
          Guiccioli, a man of sixty, who had been twice left a widower. The introduction took place
          against the inclination of both; the young Countess was tired that evening and longed to
          go home, and Byron was unwilling to make new acquaintances; both assented only from the
          desire to oblige their hostess. But no sooner had they entered into conversation than a
          spark, which was never extinguished, passed from soul to soul. The Countess afterwards
          wrote:–»His noble and exquisitely beautiful countenance, the tone of his voice, his
          manners, the thousand enchantments that surrounded him, rendered him so different and so
          superior a being to any whom I had hitherto seen, that it was impossible he should not
          have left the most profound impression upon me. From that evening, during the whole of my
          subsequent stay at Venice, we met every day.«</p>

        <p>A few weeks later, Teresa was obliged to return with her husband to Ravenna. The parting
          with Byron agitated her so terribly that during the course of the first day's journey she
          fainted several times; and she became so ill that she arrived at Ravenna half dead. She
          was also much distressed at this time by the loss of her mother. The Count owned several
          houses on the road from Venice to Ravenna, and it was his habit to stop at these mansions,
          one after the other, on his journeys between the two cities. From each the enamoured young
          Countess now wrote to Byron, expressing in the most passionate and pathetic terms her
          despair at leaving him, and entreating him to come to Ravenna. Very touching is the
          description which she gives, after her arrival, of the complete change in all her
          feelings. She, who formerly had thought of nothing but balls and fêtes, has, she says, <pb n="326"/> been so entirely changed by her love that solitude has become dear and welcome to her. She
          will, according to Byron's wish, »avoid all general society, and devote herself to
          reading, music, domestic occupations, riding«–everything, in short, that she knew he
          would most like. Longing and grief brought on a dangerous fever, and symptoms of
          consumption showed themselves. Then Byron set out for Ravenna. He found the Countess in
          bed, apparently in a very serious condition. He writes: »I greatly fear that she is going
          into a consumption.... Thus it is with every thing and every body for whom I feel anything
          like a real attachment.... If anything happens to my present Amica, I have done with the
          passion for ever–it is my last love. As to libertinism, I have sickened myself of that,
          as was natural in the way I went on, and I have at least derived that advantage from vice,
          to <emph>love</emph> in the better sense of the word.« The attitude assumed towards the young
          foreigner by the Count astonished every one; he showed him all manner of polite
          attentions; used to come for him every day with a »coach and six,« and drive about the
          country with him, like »Whittington with his cat,« Byron declared.</p>

        <p>It was a happy time for Byron. This, his one perfect and fully returned attachment,
          brought back all the emotions of his youth. The beautiful <emph>Stanzas to the Po</emph>, which
          reveal deep, chivalrous feeling, and end with the prayer, »Let me perish young!« were the
          first-fruits of the new passion. He loved truly and with his whole heart, and loved like a
          youth, without at any point taking up a position outside of his feeling or attempting to
          rise superior to it. When, in August, the Countess was obliged to accompany her husband on
          his visits to his other estate, Byron went daily to her house, and, causing her apartments
          to be opened, sat turning over her books and writing in them. On the last page of a copy
          of <emph>Corinne</emph> he wrote the following note:–</p>

        <p>MY DEAREST TERESA–I have read this book in your garden;–my love, you were absent, or
          else I could not have read it. It is a favourite book of yours, and the writer was a
          friend of mine. You will not understand these English <pb n="327"/> words, and <emph>others</emph> will not
          understand them–which is the reason I have not scrawled them in Italian. But you will
          recognise the handwriting of him who so passionately loved you, and you will divine that,
          over a book which was yours, he could only think of love. In that word, beautiful in all
          languages, but most so in yours–<emph>Amor mio</emph>–is comprised my existence here and
          hereafter.... Think of me, some times, when the Alps and the ocean divide us,–but they
          never will, unless you <emph>wish</emph> it. BYRON.<!-- højrestilles -->
          <lb/><lb/>
          BOLOGNA, <emph>August</emph> 25, 1819.</p><!-- højrestilles --><lb/>

        <p>It is needless to compare the expressions in this note with those of the farewell letter
          to Lady Caroline Lamb; one feels at once that this is the language of a truer love.</p>

        <p>When, in September, Count Guiccioli was called away by business to Ravenna, he left the
          young Countess and her lover to the free enjoyment of each other's society at Bologna; and
          he was quite agreeable, when the physicians ordered her to Venice, that Lord Byron should
          be the companion of her journey. Byron had a villa at La Mira, near Venice; he placed it
          at her disposal, and resided there with her. Of the journey and the ensuing period she
          wrote to Moore after Byron's death: »But I cannot linger over these recollections of
          happiness;–the contrast with the present is too dreadful. If a blessed spirit, while in
          the full enjoyment of heavenly happiness, were sent down to this earth to suffer all its
          miseries, the contrast could not be more dreadful between the past and the present, than
          what I have endured from the moment when that terrible word reached my ears, and I for
          ever lost the hope of again beholding him, one look from whom I valued beyond all earth's
          happiness.«</p>

        <p>The woman to whom the world owes a debt of gratitude for having saved Byron from ruining
          himself by degrading dissipation, lost her standing in the eyes of Italian society from
          the moment when she took up her residence in her lover's house. The Italian moral code of
          that day–of which De Stendhal's Italian tales give an excellent idea–permitted a young
          married woman to have a friend (<emph>Amico</emph>); and, indeed, regarded him practically as her
          husband, but only <pb n="328"/> on the condition that those outward conventions were respected, which
          Countess Guiccioli was now disregarding.</p>

        <p>It was not light-mindedness that led her to expose herself to the censure of public
          opinion. She saw her own relation to Lord Byron in a poetic light; she regarded it as her
          mission to free a noble and gifted poet from the fetters of ignoble connections, and to
          restore his faith in pure and self-sacrificing love. She hoped to act on him as a Muse.
          She was very young, and very beautiful–fair, with dark eyes; small, but beautifully
          proportioned. West, the American painter, to whom Byron sat for his portrait at the Villa
          Rossa, near Pisa, gives the following description of her:–»Whilst I was painting, the
          window from which I received my light became suddenly darkened, and I heard a voice
          exclaim: '<emph>E troppo bello!</emph>' I turned, and discovered a beautiful female stooping down to
          look in, the ground on the outside being on a level with the bottom of the window. Her
          long golden hair hung down about her face and shoulders, her complexion was exquisite, and
          her smile completed one of the most romantic-looking heads, set off as it was by the
          bright sun behind it, which I had ever beheld.« The more important it became to the
          Countess not to be regarded simply as one of Byron's many mistresses, the more did she
          endeavour to raise his poetry into a higher and purer atmosphere than that in which it
          moved at this time.</p>

        <p>One evening when he was sitting turning over the leaves of the manuscript of <emph>Don Juan</emph>,
          two cantos of which had been completed before his acquaintance with the Countess began,
          she leant over his shoulder, pointed to a verse on the page he was just turning, and asked
          him what it meant. »She had stumbled,« writes Byron, »by mere chance on the 137th stanza
          of the First Canto. I told her 'Nothing; but your husband is coming.' As I said this in
          Italian with some emphasis, she started up in a fright, and said, 'Oh, my God, is he
          coming?' thinking it was her own.« But this accident aroused her curiosity regarding <emph>Don
          Juan</emph>; she read the two cantos in a French translation; her delicacy was shocked by the
          indecency of much of the contents, and she implored Byron not to go on <pb n="329"/> with the poem. He
          at once promised what his <emph>Dictatrice</emph> demanded. This was Countess Guiccioli's first
          direct influence upon Byron's work–and it was certainly not a beneficial one; but she
          soon withdrew her prohibition, on the condition, however, that there should be no
          obscenity in the part as yet unwritten. A whole series of fine works which now proceeded
          from Byron's pen are the beautiful and enduring mementos of his life with her. The manner
          in which in <emph>Don Juan</emph> he tore the veil from all illusions, and mercilessly mocked at
          sentimentality, wounded the Countess's womanly feelings; for woman is ever unwilling that
          the illusions which, as long as they last, beautify life, should be rudely dispelled.</p>

        <p>Countess Guiccioli, thus, did her utmost to prevent Byron writing works calculated to
          destroy belief in human nature and the value of life. The themes which she, the romantic
          lover of the grand, and the ardent Italian patriot, led him to choose, were themes
          calculated to elevate her countrymen's minds and quicken their desire for the emancipation
          of their country from a foreign yoke. It was to gratify her that he wrote <emph>The Prophecy of
          Dante</emph>, and translated from the <emph>Inferno</emph> the famous episode of <emph>Francesca of Rimini</emph>; and
          it was under her influence that he wrote the Venetian dramas, <emph>Marino Faliero</emph> and <emph>The
          Two Foscari</emph>, plays which, though they are written in English, really belong, from their
          style and subject, rather to Romance than to English literature–just as they belong, as a
          matter of fact, to the Italian, not the English, stage. They are plays with a passionate
          political purpose, written in careless, and occasionally ill-sounding iambics. Their aim
          was, by the employment of the strongest means possible, to excite the lethargic Italian
          patriots to unanimous revolt against the oppressors. They are scenically effective. Whilst
          under the first impression of his attachment to the Countess, Byron also wrote <emph>Mazeppa</emph>,
          the heroine of which bears her name; and her personality was directly transferred to the
          two best and most beautiful female characters which he created at this period–Adah in
          <emph>Cain</emph>, and Myrrha in <emph>Sardanapalus</emph>.</p>

        <p>In Countess Guiccioli Byron found the realisation of the <pb n="330"/> ideal of femininity which had
          always been before his eyes, but which in his earlier narrative poems he had not succeeded
          in portraying naturally. He himself naively confessed to Lady Blessington the difficulty
          in which he found himself, and the manner in which he personified his ideals. »I detest
          thin women,« he said; »and unfortunately all, or nearly all plump women have clumsy hands
          and feet, so that I am obliged to have recourse to imagination for my beauties, and there
          I always find them. I flatter myself that my Leila, Zuleika, Gulnare, Medora, and Haidée
          will always vouch for my taste in beauty; these are the bright creations of my fancy, with
          rounded forms, and delicacy of limbs, nearly so incompatible as to be rarely, if ever,
          united.... You must have observed that I give my heroines extreme refinement, joined to
          great simplicity and want of education. Now, refinement and want of education are
          incompatible, at least, I have ever found them so: so here again, you see, I am forced to
          have recourse to imagination.« The concoctions were as impossible as they were beautiful;
          these fair ones produced next to no impression of reality, herein resembling the heroes
          whom they worshipped.</p>

        <p>From <emph>The Giaour</emph> to <emph>The Siege of Corinth</emph>, Byron's narrative poems are of the Romantic
          type, but bear the imprint of a strong individuality. Passion is idolised in both sexes.
          The heroes are, to borrow an expression from <emph>The Giaour</emph>, »wracks, by passion left
          behind«; but »wracks« which choose rather to continue being tossed by its tempests than to
          live in drowsy tranquillity. They do not love with the cold love begotten of a cold
          climate; theirs »is like a lava flood.« The most characteristic of these now extremely
          antiquated Byronic heroes is the noble Corsair–who is proud, capricious, scornful,
          revengeful to the point of cruelty, a prey to remorse, and so nobly magnanimous that he
          will rather submit to the most barbarous tortures than kill a sleeping enemy. This
          interesting bandit, with his mysterious countenance, his theatrical deportment, and his
          boundless chivalry towards woman, is the Byronic counterpart of Schiller's Karl Moor. The
          sovereign of a law-abiding people, hampered by the conventions of a court, could <pb n="331"/> not be
          Byron's ideal man; there was no possibility in such a life of romantic exploits, of perils
          by land or by water. So he took a pirate chieftain, and, to the qualities induced by such
          a man's manner of life, superadded the finest qualities of his own soul. The Corsair, who
          is accustomed to wade in blood, turns with a shudder from the young Sultana who loves him,
          when he sees the little spot of blood on her forehead–not because it is imaginable that a
          Conrad would have shuddered at so little, but because Byron himself would have shrunk from
          such a sight. It has been cleverly said that the real reason of the marvellous attraction
          of all the heroes and heroines of these poems of Byron's youth for the general public was,
          that they all moved where they had no joints. The public were not more enraptured by the
          passion of the lyric portions and by the poetical gems inserted here and there (almost
          always during the process of proof-reading), than by the deeds which were really
          impossible to human nature. It was admiration of the same kind as is displayed for the
          daring acrobat, who does breakneck feats by unnatural contortions of his body.</p>

        <p>But in these same characters some of the finer, deeper-lying qualities of Byron's ideal
          also revealed themselves. Conrad's inflexibility under suffering foreshadows Manfred's;
          and he will no more bow the knee than will Cain to Lucifer, or Don Juan to Gulbeyaz.
          Compassion for those less fortunately situated than himself, a feeling which never
          disappeared from Byron's soul, exists, though chiefly in the shape of hatred of despots,
          in Lara; and in both <emph>The Giaour</emph> and <emph>The Siege of Corinth</emph> we have the longing for the
          emancipation of Greece. It was a strange ordering of destiny that the poet himself should
          end his life as a commander of just such wild men as those he had described. The Viking
          blood in his veins gave him no rest until he himself became a Viking leader, like the
          Normans from whom he was descended. And even if all these desperadoes (Alp, the renegade,
          who leads the Turks against his countrymen, no less than Lara, who makes war on his peers)
          are simply the imaginary creatures of the poet's brain, there is in the characters of all,
          one realistic trait, a trait <pb n="332"/> which also develops in those who attach themselves to
          them–the proud endurance of terrible fates. The humour of <emph>Beppo</emph> is the form in which
          naturalness overcomes the staginess and artificiality of Byron's earlier works. The
          sympathy with human suffering, which in his serious poetry gradually swallows up all other
          sympathies, is the form in which the feeling of the reality of life prevails over his
          Romanticism and supersedes it.</p>

        <p>This feeling gained in intensity after his breach with England. <emph>The Prisoner of Chillon</emph>
          had described the suffering of the noble Bonnivard, who for six long years was chained to
          a pillar in an underground dungeon by a chain too short to allow of his lying down, and
          compelled to witness the agonies and death of his brothers, who were fettered in the same
          manner, without being able to put out his hand to help them. On it followed <emph>Mazeppa</emph>–the
          youth bound to the back of the wild horse, which gallops with dripping mane and steaming
          flanks through the forests and across the steppes, whilst he, torn from the arms of his
          beloved, whose fate is unknown to him, and looking forward to a horrible fate himself,
          suffers agonies of thirst, pain, and shame. So far Byron has by preference dwelt upon the
          things that are most terrible to flesh and blood; even when, as in the case of Bonnivard,
          there was a spiritual element in the suffering, and the theme presented an opportunity for
          the description of a heroic personality, he dwelt most on the purely physical torture. But
          now that his sympathies were aroused for the great martyrs of Italy, his conception of the
          tragic was ennobled.</p>

        <p>In <emph>The Prophecy of Dante</emph> he thus describes the lot of the poet:–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Many are poets, but without the name,</l>

          <l>And be the new Prometheus of new men,</l>

          <l>Finding the pleasure given repaid with pain,</l>

        <p><pb n="333"/> And he makes the great poet, who was, like himself, unjustly exiled, exclaim;</p>

        <p>Of Tasso Byron had already written. Even a superficial comparison of Goethe's <emph>Tasso</emph>
          with Byron's <emph>Lament of Tasso</emph> is sufficient to show us what a resistless attraction
          hopeless suffering had for Byron's imagination. Goethe takes Tasso the youth, the lover,
          the poet, and places him in the society of the beautiful women of the court of Ferrara,
          where, happy and unhappy, he is admired and humiliated. Byron takes Tasso alone, ruined,
          shut out from society, shut into the cell of a madhouse though he is quite sane, a prey to
          the cruelty of his former protectors:–</p>

        <p>Of the court of Ferrara, a court where Lucrezia Borgia has her residence, a court where
          the passions and the cruelty of the Renaissance period flourish, Goethe makes a little
          German Weimar, where everything is ruled by the most refined humanitarianism of the
          eighteenth century; Byron is magnetically attracted by what he considers the revolting
          barbarity of the Duke of Ferrara, and his poem turns into a declamation against the
          injustice and tyranny of princes.</p>

        <p><pb n="334"/> We have another description of tragic suffering, along with still more violent
          accusation–both, however, decidedly overdone–in <emph>The Two Foscari</emph>, a tragedy in which a
          father is compelled to sentence the son he loves to the agonies of the torture-chamber,
          and in which the son, who is the hero of the tragedy, is stretched on the rack during
          almost the whole duration of the play, and only rises from it to die of grief because he
          is banished. In <emph>The Two Foscari</emph>, as in his other tragedies, Byron, as if in defiance,
          follows the French fashion of strict adherence to the Aristotelian rules. In his
          conviction that this is the one right style, he risks the comical paradox, that England
          has hitherto possessed no drama.</p>

        <p>It has created much surprise that Byron, who, like all the other English poets of the
          day, was a pronounced Naturalist–which means that he preferred the forest to the garden,
          the unsophisticated to the civilised human being, the original to the acquired language of
          passion–that this same Byron should have been such an enthusiastic admirer of Pope and of
          the small group of poets (including Samuel Rogers and Crabbe) who still paid homage to
          classical tradition, even to the extent of imitating the antique dramatic style.</p>

        <p>The first reason for the admiration of Pope is to be sought in Byron's spirit of
          contradiction. The fact that the poets of that Lake School which he despised were
          continually reviling Pope, was in itself a sufficient reason for his exalting him to the
          skies, calling him the greatest of all English poets, and declaring that he would
          willingly himself defray the expense of erecting a monument to him in the Poet's Corner of
          Westminster Abbey, from which, as a Catholic, he was excluded. Secondly, we have to
          remember that the traditions of Harrow never lost their influence over Byron; and at
          Harrow Pope had always been held up as the model poet. A third thing to be remembered is
          Byron's own great deficiency in critical acumen, as an instance of which we may take his
          remark to Lady Blessington that Shakespeare owed half his fame to his low birth. There
          still remain the predisposing circumstances–that Pope was <pb n="335"/> deformed, and in spite of his
          deformity had a beautiful head; that he did not belong to the Established Church; that he
          was the poet of good society; and that his deformity begot in him a certain satirical
          gloom–all things in which Byron sympathised with him. And, lastly, we have Byron's
          personal bias (possibly attributable to his Norman descent) towards rhetoric of the style
          peculiar to the Latin races.</p>

        <p>The circumstance that Byron championed the art theories of a past age, whilst he in
          everything else belonged to the party of progress, produces a certain likeness between him
          and Armand Carrel, who also remained faithful to antiquated classicism in literature,
          though he held the most emancipated views in politics and religion. As both of them
          adopted the standpoint of eighteenth century France in most matters intellectual and
          spiritual, it was not unnatural that they should also conform to it in the only domain in
          which it was a conventional standpoint, namely, that of <emph>belles-lettres</emph>. Certain it is
          that his theoretical caprices had a baneful influence on Byron's Italian dramas. These
          consist of monologues and declamation. Byron's genius and Countess Guiccioli's patriotism
          combined did not suffice to communicate to them more than a very meagre quantum of poetic
          inspiration.</p>

        <p>But during the production of <emph>Cain</emph> and <emph>Sardanapalus</emph> the young Countess was what it was
          her desire to be, Byron's Muse.</p>

        <p>The best thing in <emph>Cain</emph> is the character of Adah. It has been often remarked that
          Byron's male characters all resemble one another; what his critics have been less apt to
          observe is, how dissimilar his women are. Adah is not a female Cain, though she is the one
          imaginable wife for him. Cain's female counterpart is the proud, defiant Aholibamah of
          <emph>Heaven and Earth</emph>. Cain sees annihilation everywhere; Adah sees growth, love, germinating
          power, happiness. To Cain, the cypress which spreads its branches above little Enoch's
          head is a tree of mourning; all Adah sees is that it gives shade to the child. After Cain
          has despairingly made it plain to himself and Adah that all the world's evils and <pb n="336"/> misfortunes are to be transmitted through Enoch, Adah says:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Oh, Cain, look on him; see how full of life,</l>
          <l>Of strength, of bloom, of beauty, and of joy,</l>
          <l>How like to me–how like to thee, when gentle!«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>Out of so little is Adah made, that all her speeches put together would not occupy one
          octavo page. When Cain has to make his choice between love and knowledge, she says: »Oh,
          Cain! choose love.« When Cain, having killed Abel, stands alone, cursed and avoided as a
          murderer, she answers his ejaculation of: »Leave me!,« with the words: »Why, all have left
          thee.« And this character Byron created almost without departing from the letter of the
          Bible, simply by sometimes putting what is really said by one into the mouth of another.
          In Genesis, Cain, when he has been cursed by the Lord, says: »My punishment is greater
          than I can bear,« &amp;c. In Byron's play, Cain, when the terrible curse of the angel has
          fallen, stands mute; but Adah lifts up her voice and says:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»This punishment is more than he can bear.</l>
          <l>Behold, thou driest him from the face of earth,</l>
          <l>And from the face of God shall he be hid.</l>
          <l>A fugitive and vagabond on earth,</l>
          <l>'Twill come to pass that whoso findeth him</l>
          <l>Shall slay him«–</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>the exact words which the Bible puts into the mouth of Cain. Byron, with the eye of
          genius, saw in this one utterance, this Old Testament lump of clay, the outlines of a
          whole human figure; and with nothing but the pressure of his hand moulded it into a
          statuette of the first loving woman.</p>

        <p>The other character in which we feel, and feel still more strongly, the influence of the
          young Countess, is Myrrha, the Greek female slave in <emph>Sardanapalus</emph>. <emph>Sardanapalus</emph> is the
          best of Byron's historical tragedies.–With careless contempt for his fellow-men and the
          world in general, the proud Sardanapalus has given himself up to voluptuous pleasures.
          Martial fame he despises; he cares not to win a great name by shedding the blood of
          thousands of unoffending human <pb n="337"/> beings; and as little does he desire to be worshipped, like
          his fathers, as a god. His careless magnanimity amounts to imprudence. He returns to the
          rebel priest the sword which has been snatched from him, with the words:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Receive your sword, and know</l>
          <l>That I prefer your service militant</l>
          <l>Unto your ministry–not loving either.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>His manly vigour appears to be ebbing away in a life of voluptuous enjoyment, when
          Myrrha, the Ionian, his favourite slave, determines to rescue him. She implores him to
          rouse himself, and prepare to defend himself against his enemies. It is almost as great a
          grief to her that she loves him as that she is a slave.</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Why do I love this man? My country's daughters</l>
          <l>Love none but heroes. But I have no country!</l>
          <l>The slave has lost all save her bonds. I love him;</l>
          <l>And that's the heaviest link of the long chain–</l>
          <l>To love whom we esteem not. …</l>
          <l>And yet methinks I love him more, perceiving</l>
          <l>That he is hated of his own barbarians.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>But when the enemies attack the palace, and Sardanapalus, after rejecting the clumsy
          sword as hurting his hand, and the heavy helmet as »a mountain on his temples,« plunges
          bareheaded and lightly armed into the midst of the fray and fights like a hero, Myrrha
          triumphs as if a burden of shame were lifted from her heart:–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Tis no dishonour–no–</l>
          <l>'Tis no dishonour to have loved this man.</l>
          <l>…</l>
          <l>… If Alcides</l> 
          <l>Were shamed in wearing Lydian Omphale's</l>
          <l>She-garb, and wielding her vile distaff, surely</l>
          <l>He, who springs up a Hercules at once,</l>
          <l>Nursed in effeminate arts from youth to manhood,</l>
          <l>And rushes from the banquet to the battle,</l>
          <l>As though it were a bed of love, deserves</l>
          <l>That a Greek girl should be his paramour,</l>
          <l>And a Greek bard his minstrel, a Greek tomb</l>
          <l>His monument.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p><pb n="338"/> It is as if Byron were prophesying his own fate. And was it not true of the poet, as of

        <p>Like Myrrha, the young Italian Countess set before her lover more manly aims than
          voluptuous enjoyment; like Myrrha, she rescued him from a life which was unworthy of his
          great and noble mind.</p>

        <p>We left the lovers at the country house of La Mira, near Venice, where Byron wrote,
          amongst other things, the Memoirs which he presented to Thomas Moore, to be left as a
          legacy to the latter's little son, but which were burned at the instigation of Byron's
          family, and for reasons which have never been satisfactorily explained. The peaceful life
          at La Mira was not of long duration. Count Guiccioli suddenly determined that he would put
          an end to the existing state of matters. The Countess would not give up Byron, and a
          separation from her husband was the result. With the consent of her family, she
          relinquished fortune and position in society; a small yearly allowance was to be paid her;
          but the conditions of the separation only held good as long as she continued to reside in
          her father's house. Here Byron regularly spent his evenings with her; he loved to hear her
          play, or sing airs by Mozart or Rossini. His diary of January and February 1821 chiefly
          consists of the following regularly repeated entries: »Rode–fired
          pistols–dined–wrote–visited–heard music–talked nonsense–went home–read.«</p>

        <p>As long as Count Guiccioli was still playing the rôle of possible avenger, the situation
          had contained the element of danger and excitement which to Byron was the spice of life.
          He believed that he owed his safety from assassination in the <pb n="339"/> course of his rides to the
          fact of his being known to carry pistols and to have an unerring aim, and from
          assassination at home to the avaricious Count's disinclination to pay the twenty scudi
          which were the hire of a first-class bravo. This excitement was now at an end, but there
          was substituted for it a new and nobler one.</p>

        <p>The whole Italian peninsula was in a state of silent but violent ferment. After the
          overthrow of Napoleon's rule, the old rulers »by the grace of God« had at once begun to
          conduct themselves with overweening arrogance. Every trace of French influence in the
          shape of beneficent reform was to be effaced, and the old abuses were to be re-introduced.
          The unbearable oppression during the general European reaction which followed the
          formation of the Holy Alliance, drove the Italians to form a wide-spread conspiracy; great
          secret leagues of the Carbonari, imitated from those of the Freemasons, were soon in
          existence in all parts of the country.</p>

        <p>The Countess introduced Byron into the circle of the conspirators. The whole Gamba family
          belonged to the secret society. The Countess's brother, Pietro, a warmhearted youth of
          twenty, who was an enthusiastic admirer of Byron and eventually accompanied him to Greece,
          was one of its most ardent and best-informed leaders. Carbonarism seemed to Byron the
          poetry of politics. The wooden Parliamentary politics of his native country had repelled
          him, but this appealed strongly to his imagination. He was advanced to a high rank in the
          society, and was made chief of a division called the Americani. He provided the
          conspirators with supplies of weapons, and offered the »constitutional« government at
          Naples one thousand Louis-d'ors as his contribution to the expenses of carrying on the war
          against the Holy Alliance. His letters display positive fury with the Austrian tyrants.
          Wherever he resided, he was an eyesore to the Austrian authorities; his letters were
          opened; the Italian translation of <emph>Childe Harold</emph> was prohibited in the Austrian
          provinces of Italy; and the police, as he well knew, were incited to assassinate him.
          Nevertheless, he calmly took his usual ride every day. On this, as <pb n="340"/> on other occasions, his
          conduct and language were distinguished by a mixture of stoic heroism and boyish bravado.
          There is something attractively boyish in his writing to Murray: »I wonder if they can
          read my letters when they have opened them; if so, they may see, in my MOST LEGIBLE HAND,
          THAT I THINK THEM DAMNED SCOUNDRELS AND BARBARIANS, and THEIR EMPEROR A FOOL.« When
          proclamation was made that extremely severe penalties would be incurred by all in whose
          houses weapons were found, he stored the weapons of all the conspirators of the Romagna in
          his villa, which became a regular arsenal. The cupboards and drawers were crammed with the
          revolutionary proclamations and oath-formulas. He thought, and thought rightly, that the
          authorities would hardly dare to search the house of a member of the English House of
          Peers.</p>

        <p>It was easier for them to drive him away than to imprison him; it was done simply by
          ordering the Counts Gamba to leave the country within twenty-four hours. It being one of
          the agreements of the separation that the young Countess was to be obliged, if she left
          her father's house, to enter a convent, the authorities felt sure that the step they were
          taking was a sure means of getting rid of Byron. Teresa's letter to her lover on hearing
          of this order ends thus: »Byron! I am in despair!–If I must leave you here without
          knowing when I shall see you again, if it is your will that I should suffer so cruelly, I
          am resolved to remain. They may put me in a convent; I shall die–but–but then you cannot
          aid me, and I cannot reproach you. I know not what they tell me, for my agitation
          overwhelms me; and why? Not because I fear my present danger, but solely, I call Heaven to
          witness, solely because I must leave you.«<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">The long work, <emph>Lord Byron Jugé par les Témoins de sa Vie</emph>, which Countess Guiccioli
            published in 1868, though it does not really help us to understand either Byron's
            character or his art, bears touching evidence to the strength and depth of the Countess's
            love. The solution of the problem which the world calls Byron, is, for her, contained in
            one word: He was an <emph>angel</emph>–beautiful as an angel; good as an angel; an angel in
            everything. The 1100 pages of the book are divided into chapters bearing the titles of his
            different virtues; one is consecrated to his philanthropy, another to his modesty, &amp;c,
            &amp;e. The chapter upon his faults proves in the most satisfactory manner that he had
            none. The description given of his person corresponds to that of his character. We have
            separate disquisitions on the beauty of his voice, of his nose, of his lips. It is
            incomprehensible how such a shameful aspersion can have been spread abroad as that Lord
            Byron was lame or had a clubfoot. His limp was so slight that it was impossible to detect
            which foot caused it; and his lordship's shoemaker, who still owns the last on which his
            boots were made when he lived at Newstead, bears witness (his attestation being appended)
            to the slightness of the defect. It is equally incomprehensible how the foolish report can
            have found credence, that Lord Byron's hair had begun in his later years to recede from
            his forehead; certainly that part of his head was rather bare, but simply for the reason
            that he chose to have it shaved. Another unaccountable and foolish falsehood is the
            assertion that his legs grew very thin. Certainly they were thinner in the last years of
            his life than they had been when he was younger; but was that at all remarkable in a man
            who spent most of his leisure hours on horseback?–When we remember that this book was
            published forty-four years after Byron's death we cannot but acknowledge that the love
            which inspired it was strong and lasting.</note></p>

        <p><pb n="341"/> The fortune into possession of which Byron came through his marriage, and which, strange
          to say, he had no scruples in keeping; another fortune, produced by the sale of Newstead;
          and the £20,000 which he had in course of time received from Murray in payment of his
          poems, had placed him in a position to exercise benevolence on a grand scale. When it was
          reported that he intended to leave Ravenna, the poor of the neighbourhood sent a petition
          to the Cardinal Legate that he might be allowed to remain. But it was this very devotion
          of the people to him that made him dangerous to the Government. He removed from Ravenna to
          Pisa. The Tuscan Government being quite as much afraid of Byron and the Gambas as was the
          Government of the Papal States, there was soon another expulsion, and the party proceeded
          to Genoa, Byron's last place of residence in Italy.</p>

        <p>In the period between 1818 and 1823 Byron wrote <emph>Don Juan</emph>. Immediately after the first
          part of the manuscript reached England, he was inundated by communications from friends
          and critics who had been allowed to see it–expressions of consternation, entreaties to
          omit this or that, deprecations of the immorality of the poem. Immorality!–that was the
          cry Byron had to hear at each step of his life, and which pursued him after death; their
          immorality was made the pretext for burning his memoirs, and his immorality the pretext
          for refusing his statue a place in Westminster Abbey. Byron replies in a letter to Murray:
          »If they had told me the poetry was bad, I would have acquiesced; but they say the
          contrary, and then talk to me about morality–the first time I ever heard the word from
          anybody who was not a rascal that used it for a purpose. I maintain that it is the most
          moral of poems; but if people won't discover the moral, that is their fault, not mine ...
          I will have none of your damned cutting and slashing. If you please you may publish
          <emph>anonymously</emph>; it will perhaps be better; but I will battle my way against them all, like
          a porcupine.«</p>

        <p>This poem, which, with its savage dedication to Southey, had to be published, not only
          anonymously, but actually without any publisher's name on the title-page, and which, as
          Byron said, had more difficulty in making its way into an English drawing-room than a
          camel in passing through the eye of a needle, is the one poem of the nineteenth century
          which can be compared with Goethe's <emph>Faust</emph>; for it, and not the comparatively
          insignificant <emph>Manfred</emph>, is Byron's poem of universal humanity. Its defiant motto is the
          famous speech <pb n="343"/> in <emph>Twelfth Night</emph>: »Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall
          be no more cakes and ale? Yes, by Saint Anne, and ginger shall be hot i' the mouth,
          too!«–a motto which promises nothing but offence and satiric pleasantry. Nevertheless it
          was with justifiable and prophetic pride that Byron said to Medwin: »If you must have an
          epic, there's <emph>Don Juan</emph> for you; it is an epic as much in the spirit of our day as the
          <emph>Iliad</emph> was in that of Homer.« It was Byron who produced what Chateaubriand imagined he
          had produced in <emph>Les Martyrs</emph>, namely, the modern epic poem–which it was not possible to
          construct, as Chateaubriand had attempted to do, on a Christian-Romantic basis, or as
          Scott had thought it might be done, on the foundation of national history and manners.
          Byron succeeded because he took as his foundation nothing less than the most advanced
          civilisation of the century.</p>

        <p>Juan is no Romantic hero; neither his mind nor his character raises him much above the
          average; but he is a favourite of fortune, an exceptionally handsome, proud, bold, lucky
          man, who is led more by his destiny than by intention or plan–the proper hero for a poem
          which is to embrace the whole of human life. It would never have done for him to have any
          special province; for, from the very beginning, there was no limit set to the scope and
          reach of the work.</p>

        <p>The poem rises and falls like a ship borne upon sunlit and storm-tossed billows; it
          passes from one extreme to another. On the ardent love-scenes between Juan and Julia
          follows the shipwreck, with its horrors of starvation and its death agonies; on the
          shipwreck follows the splendid and melting harmony of youthful love–that highest, freest,
          sweetest happiness of life. Juan and Haidée are a study of the nude, as beautiful as an
          animate Amor and Psyche; above them the moonlit sky of Greece; in front of them the
          wine-coloured sea–the melodious lapping of its waves, the accompaniment of their words of
          love; around them the enchanting atmosphere of Greece; at their feet all the splendour of
          the East–scarlet and gold, crystal and marble. All this had followed upon peril and
          suffering; and now, upon <pb n="344"/> the festival in Haidée's palace, follows such agony for Haidée
          that her heart breaks, and, as Juan's lot, a sabre gash on the forehead, crushing fetters,
          and sale as a slave. But it is to a seraglio he is sold, and presently we have the droll
          episode of his introduction, disguised as a girl, to the favourite sultana, and the
          mischievous night scene, with all its fire and fragrance, all its merry and voluptuous
          fun. Straight from this we are taken to the assault of Ismail–to human slaughter on the
          hugest scale, and to all the cruelty of a reckless war, carried on by a brutal
          soldiery–the whole described with more power and at greater length than any similar
          episode had been before in the poetry of any country. We next find Juan at the court of
          Catherine of Russia, among the »polished boors« of Eastern Europe, who are ruled by a
          gifted Messalina; and thence we follow him to England, the promised land of highway
          robbery, of morality, of the power of birth and wealth, of marriage, of virtue, and of
          hypocrisy.</p>

        <p>This rough outline merely suffices to convey an idea of the capacious proportions of the
          poem. Not only does it contain, in extraordinary variety, representations of the strange
          contradictions in human life, but each of these contradictions is followed out to its
          extremest development. In each case the sounding-lead of the poet's imagination has been
          let down to the bottom, both in the psychological and in the external, tangible situation.
          Goethe's antique temperament inclined him, wherever it was possible, to moderation; even
          in <emph>Faust</emph>, where, in terrible earnest, he lifts the veil from human life, he lifts it
          with a careful hand. But the result of this moderation is often a deficiency in the
          highest potency of life. In Goethe's works the geniuses of life and death are seldom
          allowed unlimited space in which to spread their giant wings. Byron has never the desire
          to tranquillise his reader, never thinks of sparing him. He himself is not calm until he
          has said everything there is to say; he is a mortal enemy of the idealism which beautifies
          by selecting this, rejecting that; his art consists in pointing to reality and nature, and
          crying to the reader: Know these!</p>

        <p>Take any one of his characters–take Julia, for instance. <pb n="345"/> She is twenty-three; she is
          charming; almost without being aware of it, she is a little in love with Juan; she is
          contented with her husband of fifty, but also, almost unconsciously, has a faint wish that
          he could be divided into two of five-and-twenty. After a hard struggle to remain virtuous
          she gives way; but for a time there is nothing base or comical in the relations of the
          lovers. Then Byron shows her to us in a difficult position; the pair are surprised by the
          husband; and all at once we discover a new stratum of her nature–she lies, she deceives,
          she acts a part with astounding facility. She was not, then, good and amiable, as she at
          first appeared to be? We were mistaken? Not at all. Byron shows us yet another
          deeper-lying stratum of her soul, in the famous farewell letter she writes to Juan, an
          effusion of sincere womanly feeling, one of the gems of the poem. Mental agony does not
          incapacitate for devotion; love does not preclude deceit; nor deceit extreme delicacy and
          beauty of feeling at given moments. And the letter–what becomes of it? Juan reads it,
          sighing and weeping, on board ship; in the middle of its affecting comparison of the
          manner in which men love with that in which women love, he is interrupted–by
          sea-sickness. Poor letter, poor Julia, poor Juan, poor humanity!–for is not this human
          life? Once again, poor letter! After the shipwreck, when the crew of the boat have
          devoured their last ration and have long gazed hungrily at each other's famished figures,
          they agree to determine by lot which one of them shall be killed and eaten by the others.
          Search is made for paper, but not a scrap is to be found in the boat except Julia's
          poetical and loving letter; it is snatched from Juan and cut into squares, which are
          numbered. One of these numbered squares brings death to Pedrillo. Is there, then, really a
          sphere in the firmament of heaven where idealistic love and cannibal instincts are to be
          found side by side, nay, meet upon one square inch of paper? Byron answers that he knows
          one–the Earth.</p>

        <p>From the shipwreck scene we are transported straight to Haidée. Compared with her, all
          the Greek maidens of Byron's earlier poems are immature attempts. Nowhere in <pb n="346"/> the whole
          range of modern poetry had the love of a child of nature been so beautifully described.
          Goethe's best girl figures, Gretchen and Clärchen, charming as they are, are little
          <emph>bourgeoises</emph>; we feel that their creator was a Frankfort citizen, to whom nature revealed
          herself in his position as a member of the middle class, and culture displayed itself at a
          small German court. In Byron's most beautiful female characters there is nothing
          bourgeois–no middle-class manners and customs have modified their free naturalness. We
          feel, when we read of Juan and Haidée, that Byron is a descendant of Rousseau; but we also
          feel that his high and independent social position, in combination with the character of
          the fortunes that had befallen him, had given him a much more emancipated view of human
          nature than Rousseau ever attained to.</p>

        <p><pb n="347"/> What reader (especially if he comes straight from the erotic hypocrisy of the literature
          of the French reactionary period) but feels carried away by this strong current of warm
          youthful passion, by the poet's ardent enthusiasm for natural beauty, and by his profound
          scorn for the prudishness of conventional morality! Is there, then, a world, a world of
          law in which 2 and 2 make 4, an animal world in which all the lowest and most disgusting
          instincts may come to the surface at any moment, and yet in which such revelations of
          beauty in human life–revelations lasting for a moment, or a day, or a month, or a year,
          or an eternity of years–occur? Yes, answers Byron, there is such a world, and it is the
          world in which we all live. And now, away from these scenes to the slave market, to the
          seraglio, to the battlefield, to systematic murder and rape and the bayoneting of little
          children!</p>

        <p>The poem is made up of such contrasts and contradictions. But it is not a sensuous,
          playfully satiric epic of the nature of Ariosto's; it is a passionate work, instinct with
          political purpose, full of wrath, scorn, threats, and appeals, with from time to time a
          loud, long blast on the revolutionary war trumpet.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">

          </note> Byron does not merely describe
          horrors; he interprets them. After quoting »the butcher« Suwarrow's rhymed despatch to
          Catherine announcing the capture of Ismail, he adds:</p>

        
        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»He wrote this Polar melody, and set it.</l>
          <l>Duly accompanied by shrieks and groans,</l>
          <l>Which few will sing, I trust, but none forget it–</l>
          <l>For I will teach, if possible, the stones</l>
          <l>To rise against earth's tyrants. Never let it</l>
          <l>Be said that we still truckle unto thrones;–</l>

          <l>Show'd <emph>what things</emph> were before the world was free!«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>

        <p>If, considering both from this point of view, we compare <emph>Don Juan</emph> with <emph>Faust</emph>, the
          great poem of the beginning of the century, we feel that the strong, practical, historical <pb n="348"/> spirit of <emph>Don Juan</emph> carries, as it were, more weight with it than the philosophical
          spirit which inspires <emph>Faust</emph>. And if we place it for a moment in imagination beside its
          Russian offspring, Pushkin's <emph>Jevgeni Onjœgin</emph>, and its Danish offspring, Paludan-Müller's
          <emph>Adam Homo</emph>, the fresh sea breeze of nature and fact in the English poem seems to us all
          the stronger in contrast with the polish and the political feebleness of the Russian, and
          the narrow morality of the clever Danish, poem. In <emph>Don Juan</emph> we have nature and fact; in
          <emph>Faust</emph>, nature and profound reflection. <emph>Don Juan</emph> gives us in full, broad detail the
          human life which <emph>Faust</emph> condenses into a personification; and the whole work is the
          production of an indignation which has written where it can be read by the mighty of all
          ages its »<emph>Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin</emph>.«</p>

        <p>Not until he wrote this work was Byron completely himself. The thorough experience he had
          now had of life had cured him of all youthful credulity. He knew now exactly what went to
          the composition of the average man, and what regulated that man's life. He has been called
          misanthrope because of his savage satire of such lives. He himself gives the proper answer
          to the impeachment (ix. 21):–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Why do they call me misanthrope? <emph>Because</emph></l>
          <l><emph>They hate me, not I them?</emph>«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>There is no doubt that he is occasionally cynical, but it is where nature herself is
          shameless.</p>

        <p>Is he very far wrong when he says (v. 48, 49):</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Some talk of an appeal unto some passion,</l>
          <l>Some to men's feeling, others to their reason;</l>

          <l>Of the best feelings of mankind, which grow</l>
          <l>More tender, as we every day behold,</l>
          <l>Than that all-softening, overpowering knell,</l>
          <l>The tocsin of the soul–the dinner-bell.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>Is he wrong when (ix. 73) he affirms love to be vain and selfish? Or does he let his
          satirical temper carry him too far <pb n="349"/> when he says, in describing the happiness of family
          life (iii. 60):</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Yet a fine family is a fine thing</l>
          <l>(Provided they don't come in after dinner);</l>
          <l>'Tis beautiful to see a matron bring</l>
          <l>Her children up (if nursing them don't thin her).«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>Alas! as long as there is a wrong side to the most beautiful things, it is in vain to
          forbid the poet to show it to us, let the moralist groan as he will. These passages are
          among the most cynical in the poem. And it is to be remarked that the bitter,
          Rousseau-like attacks on civilisation (as the joys of which the poet enumerates »war,
          pestilence, the despot's desolation, the kingly scourge«) are always accompanied by ardent
          declarations of love for nature (see especially viii. 61-68).</p>

        <p>Byron exclaims (iii. 104):</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Some kinder casuists are pleased to say,</l>
          <l>In nameless print–that I have no devotion;</l>

        <p>But, unfortunately, natural religion of this kind was not in accordance with theological
          ritual. Like a refrain from <emph>Childe Harold</emph> recurs the glorification of liberty of thought

        <p>There are savage attacks on the theory of the origin of sin advanced by theology, and
          satire of orthodoxy and its doctrine that sickness and misfortune make us good. Of sin we
          read (ix. 19):–</p>

        <p><pb n="350"/> We observe how much freer and bolder the tone has become since the days when <emph>Cain</emph> was
          written. On the subject of sick-bed orthodoxy Byron writes:–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>

          <l>On purpose to believe so much the more.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>Byron had now reached the stage in his literary career when he had difficulty in getting
          his works published. Murray was apprehensive, and drew back. Not even a bookseller was to
          be found who would sell the earlier cantos of <emph>Don Juan</emph> at the author's risk. Byron says,
          when comparing his own fate with Napoleon's (<emph>Don Juan</emph>, xi. 56):–</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»But Juan was my Moscow, and Faliero</l>
          <l>My Leipsic, and my Mont Saint Jean seems Cain:</l>

          <l>Now that the Lion's fall'n, may rise again.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>We have already noted what Southey dared to say in the preface to his servile poem, <emph>The
          Vision of Judgment</emph>. Adopting the rôle of informer, he called upon the Government to
          prevent the sale of Byron's works–for that his attack was upon Byron he plainly avowed in
          his rejoinder to Byron's answer, triumphantly boasting: »Of the work which I <emph>have</emph> done,
          it becomes me not here to speak, save only as relates to the Satanic School, and its
          Coryphæus, the author of <emph>Don Juan</emph>. I have held up that school to public detestation, as
          enemies to the religion, the institutions, and the domestic morals of the country. I have
          given them a designation <emph>to which their founder and leader answers</emph>. I have sent a stone
          from my sling which has smitten their Goliath in the forehead. I have fastened his name
          upon the gibbet, for reproach and <pb n="351"/> ignominy, as long as it shall endure.–Take it down who
          can!«</p>

        <p>Thus wrote the retained and salaried scribbler, who, as Byron says, had lied himself into
          the post of Poet-laureate. Byron replied in his admirable satire, HIS <emph>Vision of
          Judgment</emph>. In it, as in Southey's vision, George the Third arrives at the gates of heaven
          and requests to be admitted. But Saint Peter is not at all willing to open for him. The
          locks and keys are rusty; there has been so little doing; since 1789 every one has been
          going to hell. Cherubs arrive to insist on the old man's being admitted–for all the
          angels are Tories. But Satan makes his appearance as accuser, and he and Saint Michael
          dispute possession of the dead man. Both produce witnesses, and amongst others Southey is
          called. Southey begins to read his own works aloud, and goes on so long that all, angels
          and devils, take flight, and in the general confusion the old King slips into heaven.
          Saint Peter upraises his keys and knocks the poet down with them:–</p>

        <p>The little masterpiece is imposed on exactly the same lines as the poem of Southey's
          which it parodies.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">For other attacks on Southey, see <emph>Don Juan</emph>, i 205; iii. 80, 93; ix. 35; x. 13.</note> The difficulty was to get it printed. Murray would not accept it,
          nor would any other London publisher.</p>

        <p>It was while he was in this dilemma that Byron was guilty of the literary imprudence
          which injured him more than any other in the estimation of the English reading public. A
          talented, but not much respected man, the Radical author, Leigh Hunt, whom Byron as a
          young man, to show his politics, had (in company with Moore) visited when he was in prison
          for libelling the Prince Regent, and who was now on terms of intimacy with Shelley,
          conceived the idea of starting a Radical periodical in collaboration <pb n="352"/> with Shelley and
          Byron. Shelley, out of modesty, held back himself, but no sooner had he intimated to Hunt
          that there was a possibility of his obtaining Byron's assistance, than Hunt gave up all
          his occupations and chances of earning a living in England, and landed, penniless and
          helpless, with wife and family, in Italy, where Byron generously gave them shelter under
          his roof. But it soon became evident that no real community was possible between two men
          of such different natures and different calibre; Byron could not stand Hunt's indiscreet
          familiarity; Hunt was offended by Byron's haughtiness. But the worst misfortune was, that
          Byron sank incredibly in the estimation of his countrymen by this alliance with such an
          inferior man.</p>

        <p>In vain did Thomas Moore, when refusing to contribute to the proposed journal, write: »I
          deprecate such a plan with all my might.... You are, single-handed, a match for the
          world–which is saying a good deal, the world being, like Briareus, a very many-handed
          gentleman,–but, to be so, <emph>you must stand alone</emph>. Recollect that the scurvy buildings
          about St. Peter's almost seem to overtop itself.« Byron had promised to help Hunt, and
          would not be induced to take back his word. He little thought that, after his death, Leigh
          Hunt's first action would be to write three volumes with the purpose of sullying his
          fame.<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">
            
            Thomas Moore aptly compares Hunt to the dog which was allowed by the lion to live in
            his cage, but which, after the lion's death, had nothing but evil to say of him:–
        
        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Though he roar'd pretty well–this the puppy allows–</l>
          <l>It was all, he says, borrow'd–all second-hand roar;</l>
          <l>And he vastly prefers his own little bow-wows</l>
          <l>To the loftiest war-note the lion could pour.</l>
          <l>…</l>
          <l>Nay, fed as he was (and this makes it a dark case)</l>
          <l>With sops every day from the lion's own pan,</l>
          <l>He lifts up his leg at the noble beast's carcase,</l>
          <l>And–does all a dog, so diminutive, can.«</l></lg></quote></cit>
            
            
          </note> He gave him <emph>The Vision of Judgment</emph> and <emph>Heaven and Earth</emph>, the grand poem on
          the destruction of the world by the Flood, to which we Danes trace a likeness in
          Paludan-Müller's <emph>Ahasuerus</emph>. But the periodical, which it was originally proposed to call
          <emph>The Carbonari</emph>, but which, from political reasons, came out under the <pb n="353"/> feeble name of <emph>The
          Liberal</emph>, was received with such complete disapprobation that it was given up after only
          four numbers had appeared. The arena of literature was thus almost closed for Byron, and
          the only field that really remained open to him was that of action, of war, in the literal
          sense of the word, for his ideas.</p>

        <p>But before embarking on this new venture he gave his revolutionary feelings vent in <emph>Don
          Juan</emph> and <emph>The Age of Bronze</emph>. Shelley considered that Byron was qualified by his ambition
          and his powers to be »the redeemer of his degraded country.« But he was mistaken; Byron
          was little suited to take part in the obstinate, slow struggle of the English Opposition
          for liberty. Besides, it was not the political predicament of England alone that aroused
          his sympathies and occupied his thoughts; in his revolt against all oppression and hatred
          of all hypocrisy he made himself the spokesman of the whole suffering world. His blood
          boiled when he thought of the slaves in America, of the ill-treatment of the Irish lower
          classes, of the martyrdom of the Italian patriots.</p>

        <p>Of the French Revolution Byron had always approved. He admired Napoleon in the first
          stages of his career; but when the hero of the age passed</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»The Rubicon of man's awaken'd rights,</l>
          <l>To herd with vulgar kings and parasites,«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>and finally, at Fontainebleau, preferred abdication to suicide, he overwhelmed his
          quondam ideal leader with the fiercest satire. There is much resemblance between Byron's
          attitude towards Napoleon and Heine's. Both pour ridicule on the so-called wars of
          liberation waged against him by their respective countries. The great difference is, that
          the Englishman's inflexible pride and his devotion to liberty made it impossible for him
          to lose himself in the almost feminine admiration and enthusiasm by which the German was
          possessed. Napoleon's military fame made no impression on the man who has beautifully said
          (<emph>Don Juan</emph>, viii. 3) that</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»The drying up a single tear has more</l>

        <p><pb n="354"/> and who admired no warriors but those who, like Leonidas and Washington, fought for
          freedom.</p>

        <p>Byron had long flourished his lash above the Prince Regent's head, and many a telling
          stroke had fallen upon that royal personage's fat body:–»Though Ireland starve, great
          George weighs twenty stone.« »Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,« &amp;c. Now he
          took the country itself to task. His lash falls upon everything false and objectionable,
          from the legend of the Virgin Queen, »our own half-chaste Elizabeth,« as he calls her in
          <emph>Don Juan</emph> (ix. 81), down to the latest requirements of public opinion (<emph>Don Juan</emph>, vii.
          22):</p>

        <p>He is daring enough to attribute great part of the honour of Waterloo to the Prussians;
          to call (in imitation of Béranger) Wellington »Villainton,« and to tell him that he has
          obtained great pensions and much praise for doing nothing but »repairing Legitimacy's
          crutch.« And with a feeling and fervour far surpassing that displayed by Moore in his
          satirical letters, he tells England of the hatred of herself which she has aroused in
          other nations by her Tory politics. »I've no great cause,« he writes (<emph>Don Juan</emph>, x.
          66):</p>

            <l>Who watches o'er the chain, as they who wear.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>Byron had now reached the altitude at which all ordinary conventions lost their hold upon
          him. He pursued the »Ministry of Mediocrities,« as he called it, with his satire even
          after the death of its members. He would not let Castlereagh rest quietly in his grave,
          because, as he says in one of the prefaces to <emph>Don Juan</emph>, the system of oppression and
          hypocrisy with which that statesman's name is synonymous, endured long after his death.
          The watchword of the day, sovereignty »by the grace of God,« was obnoxious to him, as was
          also the perpetual recurrence of the phrases: Britannia's rule of the waves, the glorious
          British constitution, the noble Emperors, and the pious Russian people. On the coins of
          gold appear once more, he writes after the fall of Napoleon, faces with the old »sterling,
          stupid stamp.« The universal idolisation of the most uncivilised nation of Europe
          disgusted him. One could not go anywhere at that time without hearing the sentimental
          Cossack's song of farewell to his sweetheart, the first words of which, »Schöne Minka,«
          are not yet forgotten.</p>

        <p>Thus it was Byron who, towards the middle of the twenties, inaugurated the Radical
          campaign against political Romanticism and that Holy Alliance which was nothing but a
          systématisation of the political hypocrisy of Europe. Byron called it:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»An earthly trinity! which wears the shape</l>
          <l>Of heaven's, as man is mimicked by the ape.</l>
          <l>A pious unity! in purpose one–</l>
          <l>To melt three fools to a Napoleon.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>He jeered at »the coxcomb Czar, the autocrat of waltzes and of war.« He ridiculed the
          »twenty fools« at Laybach, <pb n="356"/> who imagined that their hypocritical proceedings could
          determine the destiny of the human race. He cried:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»O Wilberforce! thou man of black renown,</l>
          <l>Whose merit none enough can sing or say,</l>

          <l>Thou moral Washington of Africa!</l>
          <l>But there's another little thing, I own,</l>
          <l>Which you should perpetrate some summer's day,</l>
          <l>And set the other half of earth to rights;</l>

          <l>And ask them how <emph>they</emph> like to be in thrall?«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>What language! What tones breaking the death-like silence of oppressed Europe! The
          political air rang with the shrill notes; for no word uttered by Lord Byron fell unheard
          to the ground. The legions of the fugitives, the banished, the oppressed, the
          conspirators, of every nation, kept their eyes fixed upon the one man who, amidst the
          universal debasement of intelligences and characters to a low standard, stood upright,
          beautiful as an Apollo, brave as an Achilles, prouder than all the kings of Europe
          together. Free, in his quality of English peer, from molestation everywhere, he made
          himself the mouthpiece of the dumb revolutionary indignation which was seething in the
          breasts of the best friends and lovers of liberty in Europe.</p>

        <p>He himself had defined poetry as passion;<hi rend="sup">*)</hi><note place="bottom">»Poetry, which is but passion.« <emph>Don Juan</emph>, iv. 106.</note> and inspired passion was what his own
          became. Listen to some of the thunders that pealed over Europe:</p>

        <p>He had prophesied revolution; he had sorrowfully witnessed the failure of the plans laid
          by the Carbonari; but now at last the expected revolution had begun.</p>

          <l>The self-same standard streams o'er either world.«</l></lg></quote></cit>

        <p>He had been expelled from the ranks of literature in England. He had been driven from
          town to town in Italy. It had long been a saying with him that a man ought to do more for
          his fellow-men than write poetry, and over and over again had he talked of art with the
          contempt of a Hotspur. Now everything conspired to urge him to action. Consideration for
          the Countess Guiccioli alone restrained him. He had thoughts of taking part in the
          Creoles' struggle for liberty; he made careful inquiries into the condition of matters in
          South America. His <emph>Ode on Venice</emph> ends with the words:</p>

        <cit><quote><lg>
          <l>»Better be</l>
          <l>Where the extinguish'd Spartans still are free,</l>
          <l>In their proud charnel of Thermopylæ,</l>
          <l>Than stagnate in our marsh,–or o'er the deep</l>
          <l>Fly, and one current to the ocean add,</l>

          <l>One freeman more, America, to thee!«</l>
        </lg></quote></cit>

        <p>The attraction to the country which had first inspired him to song proved the strongest.
          He tore himself away from the Countess Guiccioli, who was anxious to accompany him, but
          whom he dared not expose to the dangers and hardships of a campaign. The Committee of the
          English friends of Greece had elected him their representative, and supplied him amply
          with funds. On the day of his departure from <pb n="359"/> Leghorn he received his first and last
          greeting from Goethe, in the shape of the old master's famous sonnet to him.</p>

        <p>For five months he continued to reside on the island of Cephalonia, occupied in carefully
          investigating into the real state of matters in Greece, and besieged by the different
          Greek leaders, who were at enmity with each other, and each of whom was eager to enlist
          Byron on his side. The distribution of money, ammunition, and other materials of war
          necessitated an immense amount of correspondence, to which Byron attended with dogged
          industry. He at last made his choice among the Greek leaders, determining to join Prince
          Mavrocordato at Missolonghi. During his stay in Cephalonia proposals had been made to him
          which must have been most flattering to his ambition. The Greeks had a strong bias towards
          monarchical government, and Trelawny, who was in a position to know, was convinced that,
          if Byron had been alive at the time of the Congress of Salona, the crown of Greece would
          have been offered to him.</p>

        <p>When Byron landed at Missolonghi he was received like a prince. The fortress fired a
          salute, bands played, the whole population crowded to the shore to welcome him. At the
          house prepared for his reception, Mavrocordato awaited him at the head of a staff of
          officers, both Greek and foreign. Five thousand armed men were quartered in the town.
          Byron took five hundred Suliotes (natives of Albania), who had been left leaderless by the
          death of Marco Bozzari, into his own pay. He selected for himself, as if death were what
          he desired, the most dangerous of the commands, that of the troops which were to proceed
          to Lepanto, hoping to compensate by energy and courage for his want of military
          experience; his staff were to be responsible for the strategical direction of the force.
          He had occasion, while holding this command, to be astonished by the powerful impression
          which personal accomplishments and personal intrepidity make upon half-savage natures;
          nothing produced such respect for him in the minds of his Suliotes, who themselves were
          bad marksmen, as his unerring aim and his indifference to danger. But he had undeniably
          become a nobler man. Though not free from attacks of <pb n="360"/> his old melancholy, he saw the path
          of glory clear before him. Evidence of his feeling at this time is borne by the beautiful
          poem, one of the finest he ever wrote, which he composed on his thirty-sixth birthday. If
          we compare it with the despairing lines which bear the date of his thirty-third birthday,
          the difference is clearly perceptible. Along with premonition of his approaching death we
          have manly resolve:–</p>

        <p>Byron's very first endeavour was, as might have been expected of him, to modify, as far
          as possible, the barbarity of the method in which the war was being carried on. He
          released several Turkish officers, and sent them to Yussuf Pacha with a dignified and
          beautiful letter, in which he begs him in return to treat such Greeks as may henceforth
          fall into his hands with humanity, since the horrors of war are sufficiently great without
          being aggravated by wanton cruelties <pb n="361"/> on either side. Then he turned all his attention to
          the task he had set himself, and displayed a clear-sighted practicality which stood out in
          marked contrast to the poetical visionariness of those with whom he was associated.</p>

        <p>The other Englishmen of the Committee, in their unworldly idealism, hoped to civilise
          Greece by means of a free press, newspaper articles, &amp;c., &amp;c.; but in Byron, the
          Carbonaro had made way for the practical politician. He built everywhere, energetically
          and firmly, upon the actually existing conditions–first and foremost upon the hatred of
          Turkey which existed in the breast of every Greek. He considered it much safer to reckon
          upon this than upon their devotion to freedom and republicanism. Stanhope wished to open
          schools. Byron demanded and distributed cannon. Stanhope endeavoured, through the agency
          of missionaries, to introduce Protestant Christianity. Byron, who saw that this
          foolishness would alienate the whole Greek priesthood, would have nothing introduced but
          weapons and money. And he left off making attacks upon the different European Governments.
          He had witnessed the collapse of Carbonarism when brought into contact with organised
          authority; hence his desire was to obtain for Greece recognition by the Great Powers.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately his health was not equal to the carrying out of his great plans. At
          Missolonghi he rode out as usual every day, and, to impress the inhabitants, was always
          attended by a bodyguard of fifty Suliotes on foot. These men were such splendid runners
          that, though they carried their carbines, they were able to keep up with the horses
          galloping at full speed. On one of these rides Byron was drenched by a heavy shower. Count
          Gamba tried to persuade him to return home at once, but he refused, saying: »I should make
          a pretty soldier, indeed, if I were to care for such a trifle.« The following day he was
          seized with violent convulsions–three men were hardly able to hold him–and the pain was
          so excessive that he said: »I do not care for death, but these agonies I cannot bear.«
          While he was lying in an almost fainting condition after this attack, a band of rebellious
          Suliotes made their way into his room, <pb n="362"/> brandishing their sabres, and demanding reparation
          for some supposed slight. Byron raised himself up in bed, and with a powerful exercise of
          will, ever calmer the more they raged and screamed, mastered them with his look and
          manner, and dismissed them.</p>

        <p>He had written to Moore some months previously: »If anything in the way of fever,
          fatigue, famine, or otherwise, should cut short the middle age of a brother warbler, I
          pray you to remember me in 'your smiles and wine.' I have hopes that the cause will
          triumph; but whether it does or no, still 'honour must be minded as strictly as milk
          diet.' I trust to observe both.« On the 12th of April he had again to take to bed, and
          from this date the fever never abated. The 18th was Easter Day, a holiday which the Greeks
          were accustomed to celebrate by firing off muskets and salvos of artillery; but out of
          consideration for their benefactor, the townspeople kept perfectly quiet. The 19th was the
          last day of Byron's life. During part of it he was delirious; he imagined himself to be
          commanding troops, and shouted: »Forwards–forwards–courage!« When he came to himself
          again, he began to give his last orders to his servant, Fletcher. »Go to my sister,« he
          said; »tell her–go to Lady Byron–you will see her, and say––.« Here his voice became
          indistinct, and only names could be made out–»Augusta–Ada–Hobhouse.« He then said:
          »Now, I have told you all.« »My lord,« replied Fletcher, »I have not understood a word
          your lordship has been saying.« »Not understood me?« exclaimed Lord Byron, with a look of
          the utmost distress. »What a pity! Then it is too late; all is over.« He still continued
          to utter a few disconnected words: »Poor Greece!–poor town!–my poor servants!« Then his
          thoughts must have turned to Countess Guiccioli, for he murmured: »Io lascio qualche cosa
          di caro nel mondo.« Towards evening he said: »Now I shall go to sleep,« and, turning
          round, fell into that slumber from which he never awoke.</p>

        <p>The announcement of Byron's death fell like a thunderbolt upon Greece. It affected the
          nation in the manner of a terrible natural catastrophe, the consequences of which <pb n="363"/> were
          incalculable. On the day he died the following proclamation was issued:–</p>

        <p>No other evidence is required of the impression which the news of Byron's death made upon
          all who were intimately connected with him. At Missolonghi people ran through the streets
          crying: »He is dead! The great man is gone!« The corpse was conveyed to England. The
          clergy refused it a place in the Poet's Corner in Westminster Abbey. But, dependent
          neither on the blame of England nor the praise of Greece, his renown established itself
          throughout the earth.</p>

        <p>In the intellectual life of Russia and Poland, of Spain and Italy, of France and Germany,
          the seeds which he had strewn broadcast with such a lavish hand fructified–from the
          dragon's teeth sprang armed men. The Slavonic nations, who were groaning under tyrannical
          rule, who were by nature inclined to be melancholy, and in whom their history had
          developed rebellious instincts, seized on his poetry with <pb n="364"/> avidity; and Pushkin's Onjœgin,
          Lermontoff's <emph>A Hero of Our Own Days</emph>, Malczewski's <emph>Marja</emph>, Mickiewicz's <emph>Conrad</emph> and
          <emph>Wallenrod</emph>, Slowacki's <emph>Lambro</emph> and <emph>Beniowski</emph> witness to the powerful impression made
          upon their authors. The Romance races, whose fair sinners his verses had celebrated, and
          who were now in the act of revolt, eagerly translated and studied his works. The Spanish
          and Italian exile-poets took up his war-cry; in Spain the »Myrtle« Society was formed; in
          Italy his influence was most plainly manifest in the writings of Giovanni Berchet, but
          hardly less so in those of Leopardi and Giusti. His death made an extraordinary impression
          in France. A week or two after it happened, Chateaubriand went over to the Opposition, and
          his first action after his fall was to become a member of the Greek Committee. Hugo's <emph>Les
          Orientales</emph> was not a flight straight to the East, like the Oriental poetry of Germany;
          his way lay through Greece, and he had much to say of the heroes of the war of liberation.
          Delavigne devoted a beautiful poem to Byron; Lamartine added a last canto to <emph>Childe
          Harold</emph>; Mérimée allowed himself to be influenced by Byron's occasional spirit of
          savagery; Alfred de Musset attempted to take up the mantle which had fallen from the
          shoulders of the great poet; and even Lamennais began to employ a style in which many of
          the words and expressions recalled the language of Byron's sallies. Germany was still
          politically too far behind the other nations to have exiles and emigrants among its poets;
          but its philologists had, with quiet rejoicing, beheld in the rising of Greece the
          resurrection of ancient Hellas; poets like Wilhelm Müller and Alfred Meissner wrote
          beautiful verse in honour of Byron; and there were other writers who were still more
          deeply moved by Byron's poetry–men of Jewish extraction, whose feelings were those of the
          exiled and excommunicated–chief among them Börne and Heine. Heine's best poetry (notably
          <emph>Deutschland, ein Wintermärchen</emph>) is a continuation of Byron's work. French Romanticism
          and German Liberalism are both direct descendants of Byron's Naturalism.</p>

      <head type="add">24. Conclusion</head>
        <head><pb n="[365]"/> XXIV. CONCLUSION</head>

        <p>Naturalism as an intellectual tendency in England, makes its appearance in Wordsworth in
          the form of love of all the external phenomena of nature, a habit of storing up natural
          impressions, and piety towards animals, children, country people, and the »poor in
          spirit.« With him as its representative, it strays for a moment into a blind alley, that
          of uninspired imitation of nature. In Coleridge, and even more in Southey, it approaches
          the German Romanticism of the day, follows it into the world of legend and superstition,
          but avoids its worst excesses by treating Romantic themes in a Naturalistic manner and
          keeping an open eye on land and sea and all the elements of reality. In Scott, Naturalism
          occupies itself with the character and history of a whole nation, and in vivid colours
          paints man as the son of a race and a period; in Keats, it takes possession of the whole
          world of the senses, and reposes for a moment on the neutral ground between tranquil
          contemplation of nature and the proclamation of a gospel of nature and of natural rights.
          In Moore it becomes erotic, and espouses Liberalism in politics; the sight of the
          sufferings of his native island drives this poet into the ranks of the lovers of liberty,
          intellectual and political. In Campbell, it becomes eulogy of England as Queen of the Sea
          and expression of English liberal views. In Landor, it takes the shape of pagan Humanism,
          of too repellent and proud a character to win the suffrage of Europe. It is transformed in
          Shelley into a soulful love of nature and a poetic Radicalism, which have at their command
          poetic gifts of the very highest order; but the incorporeal universality of Shelley's
          Naturalism, in combination with the circumstance that he is much too far ahead of his <pb n="366"/> age,
          and with his early death, causes his song to die away unheard, Europe never learning what
          a poet she possesses and loses.</p>

        <p>Then, like Achilles arising in his wrath after he has burned the body of Patroclus,
          Byron, after Shelley's death, arises and lifts up his mighty voice. European poetry was
          flowing on like a sluggish, smooth river; those who walked along its banks found little
          for the eye to rest on. All at once, as a continuation of the stream, appeared this
          poetry, under which the ground so often gave way that it precipitated itself in cataracts
          from one level to another–and the eyes of all inevitably turn to that part of a river
          where its stream becomes a waterfall. In Byron's poetry the river boiled and foamed, and
          the roar of its waters made music that mounted up to heaven. In its seething fury it
          formed whirlpools, tore itself and whatever came in its way, and in the end undermined the
          very rocks. But, »in the midst of the infernal surge,« sat such an Iris as the poet
          himself has described in <emph>Childe Harold</emph>–a glorious rainbow, the emblem of freedom and
          peace–invisible to many, but clearly seen by all who, with the sun above them in the sky,
          place themselves in the right position.</p>

        <p>It presaged better days for Europe.</p>

        <p>THE END</p>
